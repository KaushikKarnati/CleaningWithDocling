Although traditional selection breeding programs have made great strides in genetic improvement of aquaculture species over the past decades, faster and more precise breeding tools, such as genome manipulation, are needed for performance enhancement of aquaculture stock. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the current status of three major genome manipulation tools, including RNA interference (RNAi), gene transfer, and genome editing in aquaculture species, and discusses the advances made, challenges faced, and potential future directions of this fast-  developing field. Taking catfish as an example, this paper reviews the specific applications of these techniques to improve traits such as growth, disease resistance, reproduction, and nutritional profiles in various commercially important fishes and crustaceans, highlighting successful applications and ongoing research efforts. We also propose CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated multiplex genome editing for the knockout or replacement of multiple genes in parallel to improve multiple traits in fish. Collectively, this review provides insights into the evolving landscape of genome manipulation in aquaculture and sheds light on its implications for sustainable practices and responsible innovation."

It  has  been a  challenge  to  feed  the  expanding  population  due  to  climate change,  limited  arable  land/water  availability,  and  other  issues. In addition to crops and livestock, fish are indispensable sources of protein for humans, especially in low- and middleincome  countries  [2].  However,  this  high  demand  for  fish protein  has  put  a  significant  strain  on  wild  fish  populations because  of  near-  or  above-  sustainable  harvest  exploitation. Aquaculture  promises  to  fill  this  gap  as  a  fast-  growing  contributor  to  the  world's  food  supply,  with  global  consumption expected to reach 25.5 kg per capita by 2050 [3]. Nevertheless, improving the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture is essential for achieving future global food security. Scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations in aquaculture are  urgently  needed  to  relieve  the  pressure  on  food  systems globally."

Traditional  approaches  to  improving  production  traits in modern  aquaculture,  including  intraspecific  crossbreeding,  interspecific  hybridization,  and  selection,  can  enhance economically important traits, and have been applied to various aquaculture species. For instance, farmed fishes that have been  genetically  improved  for  survival,  feed  conversion  rate, reproductive performance, carcass yield, and disease resistance through traditional selection and breeding include channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus )  [5-8],  Atlantic  salmon ( Salmo salar ) [9,  10],  rainbow  trout  ( Oncorhynchus mykiss )  [11],  and  Nile  tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) [12], among others. Crossbreeding refers  to  the  process  of  mating  individuals  from  two  different breeds, strains, or lines to produce offspring with desired traits improved by heterobeltiosis  [13]  (Figure\u00a0 1A).  For  example,  in channel catfish, intraspecific crosses of two strains (Marion and Kansas) improved not only growth, but also resistance to enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC), columnaris disease, and parasites [14] and increased tolerance to low dissolved oxygen (DO) [15]. Interspecific  hybridization  is  the  breeding  or  mating  between individuals of two species to obtain progeny with desired traits [4]; backcrossing is advantageous in some cases to reduce labor intensity  [16].  The  best  type  of  catfish  for  pond  aquaculture in  North  America  is  the  interspecific  hybrid,  channel  catfish \u2640 \u00d7  blue catfish ( I. furcatus ) \u2642 (CB hybrid), which showed multiple enhanced traits, including growth rate, dressout and fillet percentage,  disease  resistance,  harvestability  and  tolerance  to low DO compared to their pure-  species parents [13, 17, 18]."

MAS is a quantitative breeding technique that uses molecular  markers  to  aid  selection  for  desirable  traits  [19].  Several steps are involved for MAS in aquaculture: (1) Identify specific genes  or  genetic  markers  that  are  associated  with  desirable traits, such as fast growth, high disease resistance, or better adaptability to environmental conditions; (2) assess the genotype within families in the breeding population by analyzing marker-  trait  associations;  (3)  select  individuals  with  desired marker alleles for breeding; (4) maintain a breeding program integrating  MAS,  continually  validating  marker-  trait  linkages,  and  (5)  refine  breeding  approaches  to  enhance  genetically determined traits."

Thus,  many  theoretical  papers  have  been  written,  but  few  responses  to  GS-  based breeding  experiments  have  been  conducted  in  fishes.  Most GS-  related  studies  have  focused  on  growth  (body  weight  and length) and disease resistance in salmonids using various SNP markers,  including  Atlantic  salmon,  rainbow  trout  and  coho salmon ( O. kisutch ) [19]. GS also has been applied to mollusks and crustaceans, such as Zhikong scallop ( Chlamys farreri ) for growth [28], Pacific oyster ( C. gigas ) for disease resistance [29], Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) for disease resistance [30], and banana shrimp ( Fenneropenaeus merguiensis ) for growth and disease resistance [31]. Recently, a genotype of large yellow croaker ( Larimichthys crocea ) was established using GS models,  and  selected  broodstock  showed  increased  resistance to the parasite Cryptocaryon irritans ,  as reflected by a 50% increase in survival rate [32]. Nevertheless, several shortcomings limit popularization and application of GS in aquaculture.

Here, we address each of these genomic manipulation techniques below. As the longest used technique, RNAi has been applied to prawns/shrimps, crabs, and shellfish to enhance performance and identify functional genes, especially for improved disease resistance and reproduction  control  [40].  Regarding  transgenesis,  a  variety  of growth hormone (GH) genes have been transferred into the genomes  of  farmed  fishes  to  improve  production  efficiency since the mid-  1980s when the first transgenic fish (goldfish, Carassius auratus )  were  produced  expressing  an  introduced growth hormone transgene [35]. Subsequently, the transfer of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes or antifreeze polypeptide/ protein (AFP) genes conferred heightened disease resistance or  elevated  tolerance  to  low  temperatures  in  fishes  [36,  37]. In recent years, gene transfer and genome-  editing tools have been  used  to  greatly  improve  economic  traits  in  fishes. Successful examples of such food fishes that have been developed by research institutions include GH transgenic Atlantic salmon [38, 39], leptin receptor ( lepr ) gene-  edited tiger puffer ( Takifugu  rubripes ),  and  myostatin  knockout  red  sea  bream ( Pagrus major ) [40]. However, gene transfer and genome editing are rarely applied to crustaceans for commercial trait improvement due to their having small embryos with hard shells and the release of late-  stage embryos from the mother [4]."

The process involves the expression of small RNA molecules, including small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA), to trigger the degradation or inhibition of expression of complementary mRNA, ultimately terminating the translation of the corresponding proteins. RNAi begins with the production of either of these two small RNA molecules, which can be generated from either exogenous or endogenous sources of double-  stranded RNA (dsRNA), such as plasmid-  containing primary miRNA (pri-  miRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) [44]. Viral RNA or artificially introduced dsRNA as exogenous molecules are usually processed by the Dicer enzyme into smaller fragments (siRNAs or miRNAs). They are then loaded into the multi-  protein RNA-  induced silencing complex (RISC), which is guided by the Argonaute protein for target mRNA cleavage (if it has perfect complementary) or translational repression (if it has imperfect complementary) [42, 44] (Figure\u00a02A)."

[47] found that dsRNA induced a more potent sequence-  specific silencing response than the commonly used single-  stranded antisense RNA in C. elegans , establishing a new conceptual framework for RNAi-  mediated gene silencing by highlighting a role for dsRNA (Figure\u00a03). To date, RNAi as a novel genome manipulation tool has been widely applied in the life sciences, and was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize to Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in Physiology or Medicine, and RNAi-  based drugs, such as lumasiran, have been approved by governments [48, 49]."

Alternatively,  incorporating  RNAi  molecules  into  the diet of aquatic animals is a practical method for species with oral intake capabilities. This approach can involve admixing RNAi molecules into the feed or incorporating them into specific feed formulations. For instance, dsRNA-  enriched bacteria can be fed to giant tiger prawn ( Penaeus monodon ) using Artemia as a delivery system, leading to increased cumulative survival rates and delayed average time-  to-  death following the Laem-  Singh virus (LSNV) challenge [50]. Electroporation also can be adapted to deliver RNAi molecules into fish embryos. Su et\u00a0al. [51] and Li et\u00a0al. [52] successfully electroporated dsRNA- or shRNA-  carrying plasmid to knock down (KD) expression of the nanos and dead end ( dnd ) genes in channel catfish. RNAi  molecules  encapsulated  into  lipid  nanoparticles  offer an additional option for injection or other delivery methods to improve KD efficiency. Sarathi et\u00a0al.

Recently, several off-  theshelf  commercial reagents, such as Lipofectamine 2000 and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), are being routinely employed to transfect siRNA into fish cell lines, including common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) [55], Chinook salmon ( O. tshawytscha ) [56], and grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella )  line  [57].  Oral  administration of dsRNA-  enriched Artemia or  microorganisms is  more  promising  due  to  the  high  yield  of  RNAi  molecules compared to injection or immersion of naked dsRNA in practice [43], but more effective approaches for large-  scale applications need to be developed."

This  is  primarily  due  to  challenges  in  achieving  effective and consistent RNAi delivery to target tissues, as well as issues with RNAi stability and degradation in complex living  systems.  In  aquaculture,  RNAi-  mediated  strategies  hold significant  potential  to  reduce  infectious  diseases,  improve growth rates, and control reproduction. Wargelius et\u00a0al. [58] published the first report on the application of RNAi in a fish species, zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), using dsRNA, and a higher efficiency was observed compared to antisense RNA-  mediated RNAi. Subsequently, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used  to  KD  the  green  fluorescent  protein  ( GFP )  and  tyrosinase  A  ( tyrA )  genes  with  low  off-  target  effects  (e.g.,  unintended gene expression) on the expression of unrelated genes in an economic species, rainbow trout [59]. Such studies are evidence that RNAi is applicable in fish species. At that time, most studies focused on gene transfer in fish species, whereas RNAi was widely used in crustaceans to improve performance and  identify  functional  genes,  especially  for  enhancing  disease resistance. By selectively suppressing viral gene expression, RNAi-  based strategies have shown promising results in controlling viral diseases, such as WSSV [60, 61], grass carp reovirus  (GCRV)  [57],  viral  hemorrhagic  septicemia  virus (VHSV) [56, 62], and rock bream iridovirus (RBIV) [63].

The  silencing efficiency of target genes is not 100% in some cases, resulting in incomplete elimination of gene expression, which allows normal gene and protein function [71, 72]. Another  drawback  is  that  the  injection  of  RNAi  molecules  is time-  consuming and labor-  intensive to apply on a large scale in aquatic species, even if it enables high efficiency. In addition, RNAi can inadvertently KD multiple non-  targeted genes, resulting in off-  target effects, with undesirable trait outcomes [73]. To overcome these hurdles and pave the way for widespread adoption of RNAi as a transformative tool in aquaculture, ongoing research and technological advances will have to continue."

This technique is widely used in genome manipulation to modify aquaculture species for various purposes, such as studying gene expression/ function, producing therapeutic proteins, or improving production traits [4]. The key to transgenesis success is the fusion of foreign  genes  to  a  suitable  promoter  sequence  in  a  functional expression  vector  leading  to  stable  gene  expression,  although transgenes may show no/low expression levels if the recombinant DNA does not include a suitable promoter. In practice, the transgenesis of interest is integrated into an artificial promoterdriven expression vector to circumvent regulatory mechanisms that  inhibit  gene  expression.  Various  viral  promoters,  such  as simian  virus  type  40  (V40),  Rous  sarcoma  virus  (RSV),  and cytomegalovirus (CMV), have been identified and used in fish transgenesis, leading to high gene expression in the host species, including Nile tilapia, goldfish and channel catfish [74-76]. Limited research on viral promoters is currently being conducted due to the relatively poor control over transgene expression in host tissues and to poor public perception [4]. Recently, 'all-  fish' promoters, including \u03b2-  actin from common carp and ubiquitin (UBI) from zebrafish, have been applied in transgenic catfish species [77-81], increasing the selection of available promoters."

Microinjection uses a fine glass needle to inject substances directly into cells or embryos, requiring a micromanipulator  and  microscope  in  a  clean,  sterile  laboratory  environment.  Electroporation  employs  electric  fields  to temporarily open cell membranes for the uptake of molecules like  DNA,  using  an  electroporator  and  specialized  electrodes, typically in a lab equipped for cell culture. Further, sperm- and transposon-  mediated  gene  transfer  were  developed  in  model fishes [82, 83]. Microinjection was used initially for the introduction of genes into early-  stage embryos in model and aquaculture  species.  However,  microinjection  is  time-  consuming  and labor-  intensive, coupled with a high mortality rate of eggs and embryos [84, 85]. For example, microinjection resulted in mortality ranging from 57% to 84% in channel catfish [77, 84, 86], 63% to 78% in common carp [87, 88], and 64% in rainbow trout [89].  In  comparison  to  channel  catfish,  the  embryos  of  white catfish ( Ameiurus catus ) and blue catfish are more sensitive to microinjection-  induced  physical  damage,  as  reflected  by  low survival  (~5%)  [79].  In  this  case,  electroporation  is  more  suitable to minimize oocyte lethality. Some studies have shown that electroporation leads to higher integration rates (sometimes as much as 30%-100%) than microinjection [85]. However, in some cases,  electroporation  results  in  lower  or  similar  integration rates compared to microinjection, even in the same fish species. An integration rate of 16% or 19% was observed when the donor plasmid was microinjected into channel catfish embryos at various concentrations, whereas this efficiency was 9.5% or 17.6% when electroporation was applied [77]. This variation in gene integration efficiency may result from the genetic background of the family/strain, target locus and foreign gene rather than from the method of delivery itself [4]. Electroporation has consistently shown considerable insertion efficiencies with low mortality for mass egg-  based transgenesis. However, it also has limitations, such as the need for a large amount of donor constructs. Indeed, microinjection is the most frequently used method in aquaculture species because of its convenience and low cost [90]."

By the early 1970s, the potential of gene transfer technology for understanding  gene  expression  and  altering  phenotypes  became evident [92]. Advances in gene cloning, coupled with microinjection procedures for amphibian eggs, fueled the rapid expansion of gene-  transfer studies. During the 1970s and 1980s, an increasing number of studies focused on transgenesis were conducted in cultured mammalian cells and mouse embryos [93-97], laying the groundwork for similar research in fish. Compared to RNAi, transgenesis in aquaculture focused on the improvement of growth and disease resistance traits in fish species. The first transgenic goldfish carrying the human GH gene was produced by Zhu et\u00a0al. [35], making the beginning of a significant rise in transgenesis  in  aquaculture  research.  Early  breakthroughs  by Chourrout et\u00a0al. [98] and Dunham et\u00a0al. [84] led to the creation of transgenic rainbow trout and channel catfish with the GH gene, setting the stage for further developments in the field. Over the next two decades, more than a dozen species were engineered to carry the GH gene to enhance growth [90] (Table\u00a0S2). In parallel, transgenesis was used to introduce AMP or AFP genes to improve resistance to bacteria, parasites and viruses or to increase tolerance  to  low  temperatures  [4].  Despite  these  advances, during the first three decades of transgenesis research, foreign genes were integrated randomly into the host genome, resulting in mosaic patterns of transgene insertion into the host genome and expression [4]. Traditional transgenesis is gradually being replaced by more advanced systems, such as the use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-  associated  protein  9  (Cas9)-  mediated  genome-  editing"

Prominent  among these are zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activatorlike  effector  nucleases  (TALENs),  and  CRISPR/Cas9.  These genome-  editing tools use a variety of endonucleases to induce double-  strand breaks (DSBs) of DNA, followed by innate DNA repair in cells, to facilitate targeted alterations to the genome. ZFNs have separate  DNA-  binding  (a  pair  of  three  ZFNs)  and DNA-  cleavage  ( Fok I,  a  restriction  enzyme)  domains  [99].  The zinc fingers bind to target locations on the genome and fuse to the Fok I  to  cleave  specific  DNA  sequences.  TALENs followed in  the  footsteps  of  ZFNs,  igniting  the  genome-  editing  revolution,  and  are  made  by  fusing  a  transcription  activator-  like (TAL)  effector  DNA-  binding  domain  (a  pair  of  six  TALEs)  to a  DNA-  cleavage  domain  ( Fok I)  [100].  CRISPR  is  a  family  of DNA  sequences  found  in  the  genomes  of  prokaryotic  organisms, such as bacteria and archaea [101], and plays a key role in the bacterial defense system by providing a form of acquired immunity [102, 103]. The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of two components: the single-  guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein. The sgRNA directs Cas9 to specific DNA sequences, where it induces DSBs [104]. CRISPR/Cas9-  assisted genome editing can be performed by co-  injection of sgRNAs coupled to mRNA encoding Cas9 protein or by injection of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes made of Cas9 protein and sgRNAs. Two major DNA repair  mechanisms,  homologous  recombination  (HDR)  and non-  homologous end joining (NHEJ), are involved when DSBs are  induced,  regardless  of  the  genome-  editing  tool  employed. Small insertions and deletions (indels) for gene knock-  out (KO) are  induced  by  the  NHEJ  pathway  in  the  absence  of  a  donor DNA.  In  contrast,  gene  replacements/KIs  are  predominantly induced by the HDR pathway when a donor DNA template is provided (Figure\u00a02C,D)."

At present, CRISPR/Cas9, as a relatively new technique, has been found to be powerful in modifying the DNA sequence with small indels, enabling base-  specific mutagenesis and also for gene replacement [121, 122]. Although CRISPR cassettes were discovered in Escherichia coli in 1987 by Ishino et\u00a0al. [123], the immune mechanism of CRISPR together with the Cas gene against viruses was not revealed until 20 years later [102]. Subsequently, it was shown that the CRISPR/Cas immune system can cleave invading DNA (e.g., plasmid and bacteriophage double-  stranded DNA (dsDNA)) at specific loci [124]. Two years later, the group led by Doudna and Charpentier re-  engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-  component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a 'single-  guide RNA' (sgRNA), which, in combination with Cas9, was able to locate and cut target DNA sequences\u00a0[121]. By manipulating the sgRNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for editing. This contribution spurred efforts to edit genomes using the modified CRISPR/Cas9 system, and was ultimately recognized by award of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [125] (Figure\u00a03). CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated genome editing was first applied to edit human cell lines and zebrafish in 2013 [122, 126], proving its applicability in non-  bacterial species.

For instance, the nucleases Cas12a and Cas13 have been characterized in the CRISPR-  Cpf1 and CRISPR-  C2c2 systems, respectively  [135,  136],  which  are  distinct  from  Cas9.  Cas12a produces a 'staggered' cut in dsDNA, as opposed to the 'blunt' cut caused by Cas9 and requires only one CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. Compared to Cas9 and Cas12a, Cas13 is an  RNA-  guided  RNA  endonuclease,  with  the  target  of cleaving  single-  stranded  RNA  rather  than  dsDNA.  CRISPR/ Cas12a-  mediated genome editing was demonstrated in efficient mutation  of  the  zebrafish  genome  [137].  Recently,  CRISPR/ Cas12a was first tested in a farmed fish, Atlantic salmon, targeting a pigmentation gene ( slc45a2 ) with efficiency of up to 34% [138]. However, L\u00f3pez-  Porras et\u00a0al. [139] reported that CRISPR/ Cas12a-  based genome editing led to a lower mutation efficiency (11%) than CRISPR/Cas9 (31%) in Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ). Base editing (BE) and prime editing (PE) are the latest advances in  genome  editing-offering  even  greater  precision  and  versatility.  BE  enables  direct  point  mutations at the target site in genomic DNA (e.g., changing C to T or A to G) or in cellular RNA without causing DSBs [140]. Compared to BE, PE is more complicated and consists of three parts: a prime-  editing guide RNA (pegRNA), a modified Cas9 fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase  enzyme  (Cas9-  H840A/M-  MLV),  and  a  sgRNA, which can be more precise and perform a wider range of targeted substitutions and indels [141]. Although BE and PE have been applied in plants to  improve  crop  production  [128,  129], few aquatic  species  have  yet  been  edited  using  base  or  prime editing. The first base editing was applied to a non-  model fish, Atlantic salmon, by Raudstein et\u00a0al. [142], who created a premature stop codon at the target locus by converting C to T.

To date, various GH genes for growth enhancement have been transferred into  a  total  of  19  aquaculture  animals,  including  channel  catfish [84, 143], Arctic charr ( Salvelinus alpinus )  [144],  common carp  [145-147],  Nile  tilapia  [148,  149],  southern  white  shrimp ( L. schmitti )  [150], and mud loach ( Misgurnus mizolepis )  [151], among others. A variety of growth-  rate increases were observed among different GH-  transgenic fishes. Salmonid GH-  transgenic channel catfish grew 26% faster than their non-  transgenic, fullsibling  F   progeny  [143].  Transgenic  common  carp  expressing 1 the  grass  carp  GH  ( gcGH )  gene  driven  by  the  common  carp \u03b2 -  actin promoter  showed  a  42%-80%  improvement  in  body weight  compared  to  non-  transgenic  siblings  [147].

Despite  the  fact  that  these  salmonids  carry  the same GH transgene (Chinook salmon GH ( csGH ))  driven by a promoter from the ocean pout ( Macrozoarces americanus ) antifreeze polypeptide (opAFP), the growth rates differed between species.  These GH transgene-  induced growth differences may be due to species/strain, genomic localization of the transgene, epigenetic, or genetic background coupled with epistatic interactions with other loci [4, 37]. However, the increased growth in GH crustaceans tends to be small, such as the 32% growth increase observed in the southern white shrimp when the tilapia GH ( tiGH ) gene was integrated into the genome [150]."

[163] reported that mstn -  KD zebrafish exhibited a 39% increase in mean body weight compared to WT individuals at 75 days post-  injection. Although the mstn gene was knocked down  using  RNAi  in  the  red  abalone  ( Haliotis  rufescens ),  no phenotype or growth data were reported [70]. Until recently, a mstn -  KD strain of Nile tilapia with increased body weight/length was generated by antisense RNA-  based RNAi. Additionally, fish with suppressed mstn expression exhibited abnormal lipid metabolism, which contributed to muscle development and body weight  [69].  Compared  to  the  disruption  of mstn by  genome editing, RNAi-  induced suppression of the mstn at the RNA level led  to  a  more  direct  effect  on  gene  function,  as  reflected  by  a higher improvement in body weight. The average body weight of mstn -  mutant teleosts was usually 10%-15% to 30%-35% higher than WT groups, which is comparable to results of mammals (15%-30%) [164,  165],  although  the  maximum  body  weight  of mstn -  null yellow catfish can reach 1.37-  fold higher than WT siblings at 210 days post-  fertilization [157].

Wang et\u00a0al. [168] predicted MSTN structure using the AlphaFold software, and the results indicated that mutations in mstn exon 1 had a low probability of causing a structural alteration of the MSTN protein. Another possibility is that the existence of mosaic or heterozygous individuals attenuates the weight gain of gene-  edited individuals. In addition, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF ) plays an important role in 1 gonad development. Cao et\u00a0al. [68] suggested that downregulation of the sf1 gene  via  RNAi not only decreased the gonadosomatic  index  (by  55%-86%),  but  also  increased  body  weight (by 34%-45%). Hence, even though insertion of GH transgene by gene transfer and disruption of mstn gene  by  genome editing have more frequently been used for growth enhancement in aquaculture, silencing of growth-  related genes using the RNAi technique may also be promising."

MC R has been found 4 to be involved in feeding behavior, metabolic regulation, and sexual behavior [170, 171]. In fishes, mutations of mc4r resulted in increased food intake and decreased metabolism/energy expenditure [172, 173]. For example, adult mc4r -  KO zebrafish showed increased  food  consumption/growth  and  a  higher  percentage of body fat than WT individuals [174]. Regarding economically important fishes, the mc4r of  channel catfish was mutated by CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated genome editing. Channel catfish with mc4r mutations showed 20%-38% weight improvement over the full-  sib controls [175], and mutant F  progeny were 40% larger 1 than non-  edited WT individuals [176], indicating that offspring can  inherit  target  mutations  and  exhibit  improved  growth. Coogan et\u00a0al. [176] observed that homozygous mutants of the mc4r gene in F  channel catfish grew 30% faster than hetero1 zygotes and controls, indicating that in regard to growth, this phenotype was recessive. What is more, an improved feed conversion  ratio  (FCR)  can  be  achieved  by  KO  of  the mc4r gene, which contributes to increased growth. The FCR was improved from 1.57 in the WT controls to 1.18 in the mc4r -  edited channel catfish [175]. Previous studies revealed that P 1 mstn -  null channel  catfish  were  88%  heavier  than  non-  edited  fish  at  market size, while the mc4r -  mutant fish had up to 38% improvement in growth [159, 175]. Our latest data showed that mstn -  KO channel catfish had increases in body weight, up to 90% and 45% at 3-  and  24-  month  post-  fertilization,  respectively,  whereas  this improvement was 76% and 31% in mc4r -  KO  fish,  respectively [177]. These findings indicate that mstn mutants have a greater increase in growth than did mc4r -  mutated fish, demonstrating that mc4r is a useful candidate gene for improving growth and feed conversion traits in aquaculture due to its large effects on body weight and energy homeostasis. To better compare the effects of mstn and mc4r mutations on growth rate enhancement, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of these two genes for growth regulation in particular fish species and more generally."

Lepr -  deficient  mice have a hyperphagic and obese phenotype with diabetes [180], supporting  the  interpretation  of  LEPR  mediating  the  effects of  leptin  on  energy  homeostasis.  Since  leptin  was  first  identified in pufferfish ( Takifugu rupribes )  [181], subsequent studies have isolated or characterized various leptins in fishes such as common carp [182],  zebrafish  [183],  medaka  ( Oryzias  latipes ) [184],  Atlantic  salmon  [185],  and  channel  catfish  [186].  The role of leptin remained unclear in teleosts until recently, when Yan et\u00a0al. [187] reported that leptin inhibited feeding behavior and  reduced  food  intake  following  injection  of  recombinant leptin-  AI/AII  in  goldfish.  In  addition, lepr -  KO  medaka exhibited hyperphagia in the post-  juvenile and adult stages, leading to a higher growth rate than that of WT controls [188]. In another study, transcriptional analysis showed that the lepr gene was involved in the pathways of appetite, sensing, and digestion, and that lepr -  deficient zebrafish had a lower metabolic rate than WT fish at the larval stage [189]. With respect to farmed fishes, the lepr gene was successfully disrupted in rainbow trout using the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, and lepr -  edited fish showed a hyperphagic genotype, resulting in a faster growth rate (17%-20% increase) than WT individuals [190], which is consistent with the findings in zebrafish [188]. Compared to GH transgenesis, the mutation of growth-  related genes is more promising for enhancement of aquaculture products without the introduction of foreign DNA, which  matters  in  gaining  regulatory  approval.  In  the  future, more gene-  edited fish are expected to be on the table, as the first lepr -  KO tiger puffer (1.9 times heavier than WT) and olive flounder, and mstn -  edited red sea bream (1.2 times larger than WT) are being sold as food by a startup in Japan-the Regional Fish Institute  (https://  regio  nal.  fish/  en/  genome/  ).  In  this  vein,  the mc4r and lepr genes are alternative candidates for manipulation for growth improvement in cultured fishes."

To  overcome this obstacle, bony freshwater fishes, including blunt snout bream, gibel carp ( Carassius gibelio ), crucian carp ( C. auratus ) and topmouth culter ( Culter alburnus ),  are  being  manipulated to generate IMB-  free strains through genome editing to improve carcass quality. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-   (TGF-  ) superfamily, \u03b2 \u03b2 and one of their major functions is to induce cartilage and bone formation [191]. In zebrafish, the bmp6 gene was identified as playing a key role in the development of IMBs. Mutation of bmp6 triggered  TNF-  A  signaling  via  the  NF-  K \u03b2 pathway  based  on RNA-  Seq data, which disrupted the formation of IMBs by inhibiting  osteoblast  development  and  promoting  osteoclast  formation [192]. One year later, bmp6 was characterized and mutated in  two  farmed  fishes,  crucian  carp  and  topmouth  culter.  The bmp6 -  mutant crucian carp grew faster than the WT genotype and showed a complete absence of IMBs in their F  homozygous 3 progeny [193]. Subsequently, IMB-  reduced topmouth culter was generated  by  disrupting  the bmp6 locus  using  CRISPR/Cas9assisted  genome  editing  [194].  Another  IMB-  regulated  factor known as runt-  related transcription factor 2b, encoded by the runx2b gene,  plays  a  vital  role  in  osteoblast  differentiation  in mammals  and  zebrafish  [195,  196].  Taking  advantage  of  the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, IMB-  free blunt snout bream and gibel carp were produced without affecting muscle and skeletal development  by  knocking  out  the runx2b gene  [197,  198].  Therefore, IMB-  free fishes provide bold innovation and direction for fish"

Traditional approaches such as chemical treatments, antibiotic use, and vaccines are applied in aquaculture for disease control [13, 132]. However, these methods are limited by environmental concerns or are too labor-  intensive for large-  scale applications. In contrast, the administration of antibiotics might be reduced with AMPs for disease prevention and control, which could be effective for reducing the use of antibiotics [199]. Alternatively, overexpression of AMP genes by transgenesis or gene replacement using genome-  manipulation tools holds promise for the generation of disease-  resistant strains with multi-  generational  heritability  [133].  The  first  fish  developed with elevated resistance to bacteria was produced by Dunham et\u00a0al. [76], who integrated the cecropin ( Cec ) gene from the moth Hyalophora  cecropia into  the  genome  of  channel  catfish  by electroporation-  based gene transfer. The progeny of this transgenic  line  showed  heightened  resistance  to Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) and Edwardsiella ictaluri in their F  and F  gen3 4 erations, respectively [200, 201]. Chiou et\u00a0al. [202] reported that Cectransgenic rainbow trout exhibited resistance to infection by Aeromonas salmonicida and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Grass carp possessing the human lactoferrin ( hLF ) transgene also exhibited higher resistance against GCRV and A. hydrophila than their WT counterparts [203, 204]. More recently, the cathelicidin ( Cath ) gene from the Chinese alligator ( Alligator sinensis ) was inserted into the luteinizing hormone ( lh ) locus of channel catfish and blue catfish, and Cath transgenics survived Flavobacterium covae or E. ictaluri infection at higher rates than their WT controls [79, 81]. To date, a total of nine fish species have been transformed with various AMP transgenes for disease resistance enhancement, showing resistance to 12 infectious diseases. A meta-  analysis-  based study that the pooled data of  these  studies  indicated  that  AMP-  transgenic  fish  exhibited enhanced resistance by inducing co-  expression between exogenous AMPs and innate immune-  related genes [133]. Logistic regression demonstrated that these AMP transgenes regulated the expression of innate AMP genes, such as thrombin-  derived C-  terminal peptide ( TCP ) and natural killer lysin ( NK-  lysin )."

However, except for a few related studies conducted in\u00a0vitro using fish cell lines, few aquaculture species have been produced by knocking out disease-  susceptibility genes. For example, KO of the junctional adhesion molecule-  A ( JAM-  A ) gene increased resistance against GCRV by suppressing the cytopathic effect in grass carp kidney cells [205]. In addition, STAT2 -  null  embryo cells from Chinook salmon have been shown to have increased resistance to various viruses [206]. Subsequently, deletion of the EcBCO2 or EcNinaB-  X1 genes significantly improved resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus and A. hydrophila in oriental prawn ( Exopalaemon carinicauda )  [207,  208].  Recently,  genetic  resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in Atlantic salmon was shown to be determined by a single QTL, NEDD-  8 activating enzyme 1 ( nae1 ), based on whole-  genome sequencing. KO of nae1 can reduce the incidence of IPNV by inhibiting virus replication  in  salmon  head  kidney  cells  [209].  Therefore,  elevating disease resistance by KO of disease-  susceptibility genes maybe promising as more disease-  related alleles/markers (e.g., QTLs and SNPs) are revealed by RNA-  Seq in fish species."

RBL is an important component of fish's innate immunity as an antibacterial molecule, and potential negative regulation of RBL against pathogenic invasion has been observed in some fishes [210, 211]. Beck et\u00a0al. [212]  confirmed  that  columnaris  susceptibility  was  negatively associated  with RBL expression  levels.  An RBL -  null channel catfish line was established [86], and their F  progeny had 2 higher survival than WT fish after infection with F. columnare . Likewise, GAB proteins have been shown to facilitate replication of human and fish viruses. An in-  vivo study demonstrated that KO of gab3 in zebrafish improved survival following infection with the nervous necrosis virus [213]. Moreover, tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins encoding ubiquitin ligases help regulate the innate immune system. Teleost fishes have multiple TRIM genes, and a previous study identified a TRIM gene, ftrca1 , from crucian carp. FTRCA1 downregulates the interferon (IFN) response of fish during viral infection by regulating the expression of specific genes, demonstrating that FTRCA1 is a negative regulator of IFN immunity in fish [214]. Furthermore, loss-  offunction of ftr42 ,  a  homolog  of ftrca1 ,  can  improve  resistance against spring viraemia of carp virus by enhancing IFN defense in zebrafish [215]. Nonetheless, knowledge of these in-  vitro- or in-  vivo- verified genes has not been applied to genomic manipulation of farmed fishes or crustaceans. A possible explanation is that these genes are pathogen-  specific and have a low, broadspectrum effect. Of note, several immune-  related genes, such as chitinase ( EcChi4 )  in  oriental prawn [216] and viperin in  gibel carp [217], were edited using CRISPR/Cas9 to determine their role in immune processes. These EcChi4 - or viperin -  deleted individuals showed higher mortality than their full siblings after bacterial or viral infection, demonstrating that these genes are involved in innate immunity."

White-  spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the causative agent of white-  spot disease, which is one of the most lethal infections in shrimp farming. RNAi tools have been evaluated in shrimp to provide protection against WSSV due to the lack of effective treatment to prevent this virus. Knockdown of WSSV genes, such as structural protein genes ( vp15 , vp24 , and vp28 ) involved in the viral infection cascades of shrimp, is the major strategy to reduce viral replication in\u00a0vivo. vp -  KD shrimp showed significantly higher survival than  WT  individuals  during  WSSV  challenge.  For  example, vp24 - and vp28 -  KD Pacific white shrimp had high survival rates after WSSV infection, and significant reductions in viral titers were observed in the RNAi-  treated groups [219, 220]. Silencing of the vp15 or vp28 gene by injection of RNAi molecules, leading to reduced viral load and low mortality, has been reported in kuruma shrimp [221] and giant tiger prawn [53, 61]. In contrast, in some cases, silencing specific innate immunity genes of shrimp is  another  option  to  improve  resistance  to  WSSV.  Caspase-  3 (Cap3),  a  key  protein  in  the  induction  of  apoptosis,  has  been shown  in  previous  studies  to  be  associated  with  apoptosis  in WSSV-  infected  shrimp  after  viral  challenge. Cap3 -  silenced shrimp exhibited high survival (1.9-  fold increase) and delayed mean time to death (25% increase)  following  WSSV  infection [222]. In addition to WSSV, infection by other viruses, bacteria, and parasites can be controlled by knocking down a variety of genes in different crustaceans (Table\u00a0S1)."

Effective fish sterilization could eliminate or significantly reduce  the  environmental  threats  posed  by  GM/transgenic fishes [4, 226]. In the context of reproductive confinement, genome editing could block hormones or genes involved in reproduction. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is a major signaling pathway that controls gonadal differentiation in fish. Gonadotropin-  releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted from the  hypothalamus by GnRH-  expressing neurons in the brain. The  anterior  part  of  the  pituitary  gland  produces  luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-  stimulating hormone (FSH) following stimulation by GnRH, and the gonads produce estrogen and testosterone [227, 228]. Therefore, GnRH, FSH and LH are vital and responsible for gonadal maturation in teleosts, which can be manipulated to control reproduction."

Subsequently,  channel  catfish  carrying lh mutations were generated using ZFN-  based genome editing by electroporation. lh -  null  mature fish did not display courtship, and spawning was not observed in natural environments [112, 117]. In parallel, editing of GnRH and fsh in channel catfish was accomplished using TALENs to create reproduction-  controllable strains. Both GnRH - and fsh -  edited individuals had low fertility, and application of luteinizing hormone-  releasing hormone analog (LHRHa) or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) hormone therapy restored spawning (up to 60%) and hatching (up to 80%) in  these  mutants  [117].  Additionally,  the  insertion  of  an  AMP gene into the lh locus of channel catfish not only improved disease resistance but also sterilized fish, and this reversal fertility can be restored by the induction by an LHRHa/HCG mixture [81]. More recently, Andersson et\u00a0al. [231] suggested that disruption of the FSH receptor ( fshr ) gene leaves males immature with small testes, resulting in male infertility in Atlantic salmon."

Since the generation of the first dnd -  KO  Atlantic salmon [234, 235], dnd mutants  have  been  generated  using  CRISPR/Cas9-  based genome editing in a variety of fish species, including rice field eel  ( Monopterus  albus )  [236],  sterlet  [237],  and  striped  catfish ( Pangasianodon  hypophthalmus )  [238].  These dnd -  edited  fish exhibited  a  reduced  number  of  PGCs  and  a  low  gonadosomatic index, indicating an obstruction of gonadal development. Another key protein-  encoding gene, P-  element induced wimpy testis  ( piwi ),  is  essential  for  germline  survival.  Disruption  of piwil2 and piwil1 resulted  in  different  resultant  genotypes  in Nile tilapia and Atlantic salmon, respectively. piwil2 -  KO tilapia had no/fewer PGCs compared to WT fish in the P  generation 1 [239], whereas piwil1 -  mutant P  Atlantic salmon still had PGCs 1 and produced F  offspring with lacked PGCs [240]. A possible 1 hypothesis for this inconsistent result is that mosaic or heterozygous individuals carrying piwil2 mutations were presented in P 1 Atlantic salmon. Another possible explanation is that Atlantic salmon are tetraploid, and only the knockout of all copies of the target  gene  can  cause  the  total  loss  of  function.  Intriguingly, several  studies  suggest  that  sex  reversal  can  be  achieved  by knocking  out  a  single  gene,  such  as  PDZ  domain-  containing ( pfpdz1 ), forkhead  box  protein  L2  ( foxl2 ), and  cytochrome P450 17A1 ( cyp17a1 )  genes  in  different  fishes.  Dan  et\u00a0 al.  [241] revealed that inactivation of pfpdz1 by genome editing triggered ovarian differentiation in yellow catfish, while overexpression of pfpdz1 by  transgenesis  induced  XX  ovaries  to  differentiate into  testicular-  like  tissues.  Multiple foxl2 homeologs  were  edited using CRISPR/Cas9 in gibel carp, and approximately 30% of mutant females completely reverted to males [242]. Recently, the depletion of cyp17a1 was shown to produce cyp17a1 -/ -XX neomales,  which  could  be  used  to  generate  all-  female  populations  ( cyp17a1 +/ -XX)  through  neomale-  WT  female  mating [243]. In the ridgetail white prawn ( Exopalaemon carinicauda ), sex-  reversed  neo-  female  individuals  with  female  phenotypic characteristics  can  be  obtained  by  knocking  out  the  insulinlike androgenic gland ( IAG ) hormone gene using CRISPR/Cas9 [244].  These  genes  are  promising  candidates  for  generating monosex teleost/crustacean populations in sexually dimorphic species."

In  males,  knockout  of  specific reproduction-  related genes resulted in decreased spermatogenic cells  or  reduced  sperm  quality/motility  and  even  sterilization. For instance, CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated  mutation  of eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha ( eEF1A )  resulted in infertility in P 1 males  due  to  abnormal  spermiogenesis  [245].  Male  tilapia carrying the estrogen receptor ( esr )  mutation  had  smaller  testis, fewer spermatogonia, and more abnormal sperm than WT controls  [246].  Moreover,  the  insulin-  like  growth  factor  ( igf3 ) gene has been shown to regulate spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation in fishes. Igf3 -  mutant XY tilapia were subfertile, with drastically reduced semen volume and sperm count [247]. Similarly, disruption of the thrombospondin1 ( tsp1 )  and esr2b genes resulted in delays in ovarian development in females [246, 248]. In addition, sex reversal in tilapia can be achieved by editing the steroidogenic factor-  1 ( Sf-  1 ) gene, which regulates steroidogenesis  and  reproduction  in  mammals.

RNAi can be used to downregulate or silence genes essential  for  reproductive  processes  in  aquatic  species,  especially crustaceans. The hormone IAG plays an important role in sexual differentiation and maintenance of masculinity in crustaceans. In this vein, a sexual shift was observed by silencing the IAG gene  in  numerous  studies,  with  varying  outcomes  across different species. For instance, IAG silencing by dsRNA injection in the red-  claw crayfish ( Cherax quadricarinatus ) induced feminization  of  male  traits  or  secondary  sexual  characters, sperm reduction, and testicular degeneration [250], consistent with results of subsequent studies in the giant river prawn. IAG -silenced giant river prawn displayed delayed appearance of malespecific secondary traits and induced neo-  females with ovarian development [65, 251]. In addition, IAG silencing by RNAi has been performed in other species, including Chinese mitten crab ( Eriocheir  sinensis )  [67],  peppermint  shrimp  ( Lysmata  vittate ) [252], and red swamp crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) [253, 254]. Sharabi  et\u00a0 al.  [66]  found  that  RNAi-  mediated  suppression  of the insulin-  like receptor ( IR ) increased IAG production and accelerated the appearance of male secondary sexual characters by blocking the IAG synthesis pathway. In addition, RNAi has found a niche application in aquaculture, particularly in the sex reversal of species such as shrimps and prawns. For example, in the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii , RNAi has been used to reverse sex, producing all-  female monosex populations. This approach is beneficial because all-  female populations often show better growth rates and are more desirable in commercial production due to their uniformity and higher market value. A successful large-  scale field study demonstrated the effectiveness of this method [255], where the RNAi-  induced sexreversal technique was employed to produce all-  female monosex cultures, significantly improving production efficiency in prawn farming."

Theoretically,  similar  outcomes  could be obtained in other fish species by suppressing the expression of these two genes via RNAi. Knockdown constructs (driven by a copper transport protein gene) based on 3\u2032 nanos short hairpin RNAi appeared to result in the best suppression and subsequent restoration of normal sexual maturity in channel catfish [51,  257],  and  reduced  gonad  development  (93%  smaller  than WT) in PGC-  KD fish [258]. To mitigate the potential risks of copper, a salt-  sensitive Tet-  off-  like system (driven by a salt-  sensitive promoter)  was  constructed  to  knock  down nanos and dnd in channel catfish (Figure\u00a05B). In this design, salt-  treated embryos repressed expression of the KD construct and allowed PGC to proliferate for gonadal development of broodstock. The spawning rates of full-  sibling P  channel catfish with and without ex1 posure to the construct as treated and untreated embryos were 93% and 59%, respectively [52]. In common carp, four constructs containing RNAi molecules were electroporated into embryos to KD or eliminate expression of two PGC genes, nanos and dnd . The targeted mRNAs of nanos and dnd were knocked down to minimal levels or degraded, resulting in reduced rates of sexual maturation in males [64]. These plasmid-  assisted RNAi strategies are promising and applicable for reversible sterilization in fishes without induction of foreign genes."

In  addition  to  desaturase  genes,  the  elongase-  like  genes,  such as the elongase gene for producing very-  long-  chain fatty acids ( elovl2 ),  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  DHA  biosynthesis  pathway [265].  Overexpression  of  the  elongase-  like  gene  ( melo ) from masu salmon in transgenic zebrafish improved the DHA content by 1.33-  fold compared to non-  transgenic fish [266]. In addition, transgenic nibe croaker ( Nibea mitsukurii ) carrying the elovl2 gene  isolated  from  masu  salmon,  had  2.28-  fold  higher docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) content than their non-  transgenic counterparts [267], which can be converted to DHA. Building on these previous studies, Xing et\u00a0al. [78, 268] produced elovl2 -transgenic channel catfish with DHA content in muscle up to 1.62-  fold  higher  than  WT  full  siblings.  The  transgenic  channel catfish not only showed an increase of 121.6% and 32.8% in EPA and DHA, respectively, but also had a 41.8% increase in body weight compared to non-  transgenic fish when the elovl2 transgene was inserted into the mc4r locus [269]. Another gene that encodes a desaturase enzyme (omega-  3 desaturase) is fat1 , which  exists  in  lower  lifeforms,  such  as  plants,  microorganisms, and nematodes but is absent in most animals [270, 271].

One of the possible explanations for the lesser effort to explore environmental tolerances using gene transfer is that many hybrid fishes in early studies show increased environmental adaptability due to heterosis. For example, the hybrids between Nile tilapia (low salinity tolerance) and red tilapia, O. mossambicus (high salinity tolerance), displayed improved tolerance to high salinity [275]. Red tilapia backcrossed to cold-  tolerant blue tilapia, O. aureus , and the F  backcross showed better cold tolerance 1 than either parent [276]. Interspecific channel \u00d7 blue hybrid catfish exhibited a 50%-100% increase of heterotic tolerance to low oxygen [277, 278]. In addition, MAS proved effective for increasing  tolerance  to  extreme  temperatures.  In  rainbow  trout,  25% of progeny exhibited a heightened degree of upper-  temperature tolerance following MAS for heat tolerance [279]. While some GH-  transgenic fished did show improved tolerance to low temperature or low oxygen, these improvement abilities were mainly due to positive pleotropic effects of the transgenes. For example, GH has a critical role in osmoregulation and ventilation [4, 280], which could be related to the response to conditions of low oxygen. GH-  transgenic common carp and channel catfish showed better tolerance to oxygen stress coupled with lower ventilation rates at low DO compared with controls."

Subsequently,  these  genes  driven  by  their native promoters were transferred into the genome of channel catfish in an attempt to modify their response to hypoxia using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Grp transgenics showed alterations in the swimbladder morphology [288], which expands the knowledge base on the adaptation of aquatic organisms to hypoxia, as well as preliminary insights into the production of ABO transgenic fish capable of surviving in low-  oxygen water."

Intriguingly, L-  amino acid intake and feeding behavior are associated with the gene taste receptor family 1 ( t1r ) in mammals. The conserved function of t1r or its heterodimers ( t1r1 and t1r3 ) has been validated in fishes, including medaka and grass carp [310,  311].

Recently,  a  ryanodine  receptor  1  (RyR1,  encoded  by the ryr1b gene)  mutant  zebrafish  line  displayed  weak  muscle contractions and slow swimming in response to external stimuli, implicating that ryr1b is  a  key gene involved in fast swimming  [314].

Moreover, expression of other PGC marker genes, such as vasa , showed 1.5- to 11.3-  fold off-  target downregulation when RNAi molecules  were  designed  to  target  the dnd and nanos genes [52, 257]. Also, overdoses of exogenous siRNAs or miRNAs may saturate the endogenous RNAi machinery, leading to competition for binding sites and reducing the efficiency of specific gene silencing.

                "text": "In contrast, early gene transfer was achieved by random integration of recombinant DNA into the target genome by microinjection or electroporation. For example, morphological alterations from GH gene transfer were observed in various fishes. Some P 1 generation GH-  transgenic coho salmon showed excessive levels of GH, resulting in morphological abnormalities in the head, fin, jaw, and operculum [89]. WT rainbow trout possessing foreign GH not only had increases in growth rates, but also showed cranial abnormalities [320]. The possible hypotheses are that GH transgenesis affects growth pathways beyond those controlled by homeostatic processes that maintain normal morphology and viability [4], or that random integration of the foreign gene disrupts other functional genes due to off-  target effects. CRISPR/ Cas9-  mediated genome editing/gene replacement induced lowprobability off-  target events in fish species. For example, lethal off-  target effects on fry were observed when the lh locus was edited using ZFNs in channel catfish [112]. Furthermore, potential off-  target  events  were  presented  when  the Hrg transgene  was inserted into chromosome 1 of channel catfish using a CRISPR/ Cas9-  mediated KI system [288]. Xing et\u00a0al. [268] found that KI of the elovl2 transgene at the lh locus of channel catfish resulted in morphological deformities caused by off-  target effects. In particular, increased off-  target events were observed in fish when double  genes  were  integrated  into  targeted  sites  compared  to single gene insertions [168, 274]. However, no obvious off-  target effects were detected in some studies, even in the same fish species.  No  detectable  off-  target  phenotypes  were  observed  when the GnRH of channel catfish was mutated via TALEN-  mediated KO [117],  or  when Cath was  inserted  into  the  non-  coding  regions  of  channel  catfish  via  CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated  KI  [77]. These studies showed that occurrence of off-  target  events  depended  upon  the  experimental  design,  target  specificity,  and sensitivity of detection methods. Indeed, sgRNA target sites can be predicted by conducting BLAST (basic local alignment and search tool) searches against the genome of the target species or by using other bioinformatic tools to optimize sgRNA design, such as Cas-  OFFinder [321] and CRISPRdirect [322], to minimize off-  target effects. In addition, high-  fidelity Cas nucleases, such as Cas9 variants (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9-  HITI, dCas9-  SSAP), have been engineered to exhibit higher specificity by reducing off-  target binding [323, 324]."

Mosaicism is a common phenomenon observed in both transgenesis and genome editing techniques in aquaculture species and other organisms. Mosaicism occurs when an organism contains cells with different genetic compositions due to incomplete or variable incorporation of the introduced genetic material or edit during early development [4, 325], causing a low frequency of germline transmission of the foreign DNA or mutant sequences. In gene transfer, if the microinjected DNA fragment integrated after the one-  cell embryonic stage, the animal would be mosaic, for the transgene could have contained one or multiple copies in some cells and none in others. Mosaic individuals have been detected in GH-  transgenic channel catfish [84], Nile tilapia [326], common carp [87], coho salmon [89], and mud loach [327]. Similarly, genome-  editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 can lead to mosaicism if the editing machinery induces genetic modifications in only a portion of the targeted cells [325]. After CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated DNA cleavage, the repair process can vary from cell to cell, resulting in the incorporation of edited or unedited DNA sequences. As a result, edited and unedited cells coexist within the organism, leading to mosaicism. Zhong et\u00a0al. [115] reported that a mstn -  mutant common carp had different types of indels in its genomic DNA, indicating potential mosaicism. In addition, high mosaicism was observed in mstn -  edited  red  sea  bream  [161].  Recently,  mosaic elovl2 -transgenic channel catfish were identified by quantitative realtime PCR or intraspecific hybridization [78, 269]. Mosaic blue catfish were detected by Cath being expressed in only six of nine tissues examined when the Cath transgene was integrated into the lh locus [79]. Given the occurrence of off-  target effects, it is essential to screen the tissues of the progeny for mosaicism to ensure that the genetic modifications are consistent and complete across all cells, thereby preventing unintended variability and ensuring the reliability of experimental outcomes. Nonetheless, a  mosaic  broodstock  carrying  transgenes  or  mutations  in  the germline can be used in traditional selective breeding to obtain multi-  general transgenic or gene-  edited progeny."

Currently, the number  of  known genes linked to these traits in aquaculture species is limited. This limitation hampers the ability to effectively apply genetic manipulation techniques, such as gene editing, to enhance these traits. While some gene functions are conserved across  different  species,  including  humans,  the  functions  of many genes can vary significantly between species. This variation means that relying solely on knowledge derived from model organisms or other animals may not always lead to successful trait  enhancement in aquaculture species. Consequently, a focused effort on identifying specific gene variants that directly influence  key  traits  in  aquaculture  species  is  essential.  The identification of these causative gene variants requires comprehensive genomic studies, including GWAS, QTL mapping, and functional genomics approaches.

GH-  transgenic  channel  catfish  fry  are  more susceptible  to  predation  than  WT  counterparts  under  natural conditions  without  supplemental  feeding  in  confined  earthen ponds [328], and GH-  transgenic coho salmon fry are more easily  preyed upon than WT controls [329]. An alternative explanation could be starvation due to increased metabolism of the transgenic fry [226]. GH-  transgenic first-  feeding rainbow trout fry had lower survival in stream mesocosms in the presence of predators [330], possibly due to the additive effect of the transgene that negatively decreased their foraging ability and risk of predation  [226].  The  fitness  of  'all-  fish'  GH-  transgenic  common carp was lower than that of control fish in a 6.7-  ha artificial lake mimicking carp habitat in the Yangtze River in China, as reflected by decreased swimming speed and viability [331]. Taken together, it appears that these transgenic fish are less fit than non-  transgenic and WT individuals, and transgenes would likely be selected against in the natural environment [226], indicating little environmental risk from transgenic fish."

The U.S. FDA strongly supports the use of genome editing and other genome manipulation tools to bring new, innovative products to market that can improve human and animal health, enhance animal  well-  being,  and  improve  food  production  and  quality [338].  Regulatory frameworks governing the release and commercialization of genetically engineered aquatic species are critical [339, 340], but they vary widely across jurisdictions, posing challenges for researchers, developers, and industry stakeholders seeking to navigate a patchwork of regulations. Therefore, harmonizing regulatory standards, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and establishing transparent channels of communication [341] are critical steps in addressing regulatory challenges and fostering public confidence in the development and deployment of genetically engineered aquatic species."

Society appears to be more accepting of genome editing than of transgenesis [340], because the small indel-  induced mutation from genome editing maybe equivalent to naturally occurring allelic mutation. Indeed, consumers often prioritize safety when considering GM foods, but generally have a very low level of awareness of transgenesis  and  genome  editing.  Therefore,  greater  efforts  should be devoted to educating the public about the science, benefits, and potential risks associated with these genome manipulation technologies [4, 340], which can help dispel misconceptions and foster  acceptance.  By  addressing  these  considerations  and  engaging with consumers in a transparent and responsive manner, stakeholders can work towards fostering greater acceptance of GM aquaculture species in the marketplace."

Using  CRISPR/Cas9  or  other genome-  editing tools, researchers can simultaneously introduce edits to multiple genes targeting different traits within the same organism. This approach allows the simultaneous improvement of  multiple  traits  in  aquaculture  species.

Moreover, to obtain transgenic fish lines with reversible sterilization and improved disease resistance, the alligator AMP gene Cath was integrated into the lh locus of channel catfish and blue catfish using ssODN  or  dsDNA-  mediated  CRISPR/Cas9  systems  [79,  81]. Based on these empirical data and theoretical foundations, our hypothesis is that replacing the original functional genes with AMGs  in  specific  coding  regions  of  the  chromosome  would confer  multi-  generational  antimicrobial  activities  to  the  host and improve multiple producer-  favored traits. This strategy will hopefully allow us to create new fish lines possessing multiple traits, such as enhanced growth and disease resistance, sterilization and disease resistance, double enhanced disease resistance, improved DHA content and disease resistance, or hybrid lines with all of these improved traits (Figure\u00a06). Although these studies demonstrated that simultaneous gene KI and KO might support more rapid attainment in reducing potential deleterious environmental risks of transgenic fish, the potential pleiotropic/ off-  target  effects  caused  by  multiple-  gene  editing/replacement should be considered. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the  development  of  true-  breeding  lines  and  their  subsequent crossing would be necessary to stabilize these traits, a process that  requires  significant  time  and  financial  investment.  This would also need to be followed by rigorous regulatory approval processes, which add further complexity and cost. Given these challenges,  such  an  ambitious  breeding  program  would  likely be feasible only for well-  funded breeders or organizations with the resources to sustain long-  term development and navigate the extensive regulatory landscape."

Researchers  continue to refine existing tools and explore new approaches in the dynamic field of genome editing. The Cas9 enzyme was the primary focus of the initial stages of CRISPR development, while novel CRISPR platforms have emerged to enhance the precision, efficiency, and versatility of genome editing. Some of these novel CRISPR platforms may show promise for aquaculture applications.  For  example,  CRISPR/Cas12a-  mediated  genome  editing has been tested in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, resulting in relatively high editing efficiencies in fish species. However, compared to Cas9, studies showed a lower editing efficiency for the slc45a2 gene in  Atlantic  salmon  (&gt; 90%  vs.  63%)  and  rainbow  trout  (&gt; 90% vs. 67%) cell lines using the Cas12a enzyme [130]. L\u00f3pez-  Porras et\u00a0al. [139] reported that use of the Cas9 enzyme resulted in a higher  KO  efficiency  (31%  vs.  11%)  than  Cas12a  for  targeting the slc45a2 gene  in  Atlantic  cod.  Although  CRISPR/Cas12amediated  genome  editing  offers  advantages  in  mammalian cells, lower efficiency than CRISPR/Cas9 was observed in fish species, which may be due to differences in target recognition and PAM requirements. Cas9 recognizes a specific sequence of about 20 bp (the sgRNA), whereas Cas12a recognizes a longer sequence of about 23-24 bp. This longer recognition sequence might  decrease  the  likelihood  of  off-  target  effects,  where  the Cas protein binds and cuts DNA at unintended sites, leading to reduced efficiency and potential unintended mutations. In addition, Cas9 typically requires a PAM sequence of NGG, which is relatively common in the genome. In contrast, Cas12a recognizes a T-  rich  PAM sequence, which may be less prevalent in fish genome, limiting the number of available target sites and reducing editing efficiency. Nevertheless, these studies have expanded the toolbox for genome editing in aquaculture."

The  cytosine  base-  editing  (CBE) system, consisting of a cytidine deaminase fused with an nCas9 (D10A)  and  an  uracil  glycosylase  inhibitor,  converts  targeted cytosine to uracil in genomic DNA [342]. In addition to CBE, adenine base editing (ABE), which mediates the conversion of A to G in the target DNA sequence, was also developed by David Liu's group [343]. Both base editors can induce premature stop codons to produce loss-  of-  function proteins and have been applied in zebrafish with high efficiency of on-  target single-  base substitutions [344, 345]. With respect to farmed fishes, base editors can be easily designed for in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo applications. To date, CBE is the only base-  editing method that has been applied to genome editing in Atlantic salmon, with findings showing an average of 50%-66% correct conversion of the target base [142]. Compared to Cas9-  induced multiple indels, CBE or ABE preserves the reading frame of the gene and potentially reduces the risk of unintended consequences, and this artificially mediated point mutation is closer to the result of natural random mutation."

These technologies could revolutionize genetic research, biotechnology, and medical therapies by providing unprecedented control over genetic information. As RNA-  guided genomic transcriptional regulation tools, CRISPRi and CRISPRa consist of a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9), a transcriptional effector  and  a  customizable  sgRNA. This type of dCas9/sgRNA complex is incapable of cleaving DNA, but retains the ability to specifically bind to target DNA, resulting in transcriptional regulation similar to RNAi but with different mechanisms [347]. Extensive  work  is  currently  being  done  in  crops  to  enhance the  resistance  or  tolerance  to  biotic  and  abiotic  stresses  using CRISPR/dCas9 systems [348]. In contrast, the lack of CRISPR/ dCas9-  mediated epigenome editing was documented in fish species. Fukushima et\u00a0al. [349] reported an approach using dCas9 combined with sgRNA to induce repressive histone modification in a locus-  specific manner in medaka. Obviously, the study of epigenetics in fish species is still relatively nascent compared to that in mammals or plants. The lack of comprehensive epigenomic data and understanding of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in fishes may hinder the development and application of CRISPR/dCas9-  mediated epigenome-  editing tools."

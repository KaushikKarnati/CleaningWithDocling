The growth of aquaculture has been especially 1 remarkable in biologically diverse regions with persistent undernourishment and underdevelopment, such as the Amazon . While the expan2 sion of aquaculture in the Amazon offers opportunities to enhance the region's food security, livelihoods and economic development, it also carries substantial environmental risks such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, pollution and biodiversity impacts . Further, aqua3 culture production occurs alongside other foods, such as cattle and wild fisheries, and the social-environmental trade-offs are relative. Thus, understanding aquaculture's potential to foster sustainable and inclusive development as a component of broader food systems is pivotal for aligning food production with sustainable development goals related to zero hunger, life below water and responsible consumption and production . 4"

We underscore the need for strategic approaches that balance aquaculture's growth with ecological preservation to ensure its sustainable expansion in the Amazon. We conclude by offering insights into the future of sustainable aquaculture in the Amazon with implications for global aquaculture development."

Contemporary Amazonian aquaculture production began in the 1980s mainly with the founding of the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazon\u00eda Peruana in Peru and Embrapa Amaz\u00f4nia Ocidental in Brazil 13 . These public institutions fostered new cultivation technologies, from hatchery development to hormonal treatments 13 . Since then, Amazonian aquaculture production has grown exponentially (Fig. 1a). Of Amazonian countries, Brazil is the largest aquaculture producer, and its expansion has largely been supported by governmental and multilateral incentives 13 (Fig. 1b). In other Amazonian countries (Peru and Ecuador), freshwater aquaculture has been overshadowed by mariculture along their coasts, despite efforts to expand within the Amazon basin proper 1,14 ."

Farming of Colossoma macropomum (common names: tambaqui, gamitana or cachama) accounts for nearly half of aquaculture production in the Amazon, followed by Piaractus brachypomus (pirapitinga or pacu), Pseudoplatystoma spp. (surubim or doncella), Brycon spp. (matrinx\u00e3 or s\u00e1balo) and Arapaima gigas (pirarucu or paiche) (Fig. 1b). The most commonly cultured non-native fishes include Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), mainly at higher elevations in the Andean Amazon, and Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia), which together accounted for 15% of total production in 2021 (Fig. 1b). However, this percentage is probably underestimated since many producers under-report production of non-native fishes such as Nile tilapia, which is illegal in certain Brazilian states. Crustaceans such as freshwater shrimp and molluscs are also produced, but at a much lower volume than fish 2,15 (Fig. 1b)."

Growth of C. macropomum production drives the overall rate of aquaculture expansion in the Amazon, and its production now has critical roles in regional food security and economic activity 16 . This growth is driven by its market appeal as C. macropomum has a desirable taste profile and can be raised in a variety of aquaculture systems and environmental conditions 17,18 . Expansion of C. macropomum cultivation has paved the way for a rising trend in creation and production of hybrid species, exemplified by C. macropomum \u00d7 P. brachypomus (tambatinga, pacutana) which exhibits enhanced growth rates, disease resistance and adaptability to a wider range of farming conditions 15,19 ."

Instead of replacing wild-caught fish, the growth of aquaculture has been additive to wild fish availability, as aquaculture has responded to an overall increase in fish demand, benefiting farmers rather than those who rely on wild fisheries 94-96 . While such studies do not exist for the Amazon, little evidence elsewhere supports the notion that aquaculture suppresses wild fisheries overexploitation 94 . In addition, aquaculture producers often capture fingerlings from the wild, so the activity could further contribute to population declines 97 . Moreover, marine fish are a major ingredient in fish feed, and even if farming fish relieves overexploitation in the Amazon, the impact on wild fisheries could shift to other ecosystems 98,99 .

For example, developing aquaculture operations on cattle ranches could contribute to food production and livelihoods while potentially offsetting the need for further deforestation of inefficient livestock-based food systems.

Indeed, damming rivers for pond construction should be discouraged as these practices impact river connectivity and can increase nutrient and pollution outflow to water bodies (Fig. 2)."

The Amazon basin is Earth's most diverse freshwater system, with over 2,500 fish species. Yet Amazonian aquaculture is concentrated on few species, which are often produced in monocultures. Integrating biodiversity within farms and tapping the broader biodiversity available in the region can advance aquaculture sustainability. For example, polycultures typically increase resource use efficiency in aquaculture ponds 56 . In addition, leveraging the existing genetic diversity within wild populations of farmed species can yield varieties that are more disease resistant, reducing the need for antibiotics and other management practices that may have high economic and ecological costs. That said, a cautious approach to leveraging fish biodiversity for food production is warranted since new varieties can also contaminate wild populations. Indeed, non-native species, particularly tilapia, threaten Amazonian fish biodiversity, and similar detrimental impacts, including inbreeding and disease transfer, could also arise from the introduction of new genetic varieties of native species. These risks underscore the need for monitoring farm-level practices and for policies and regulations that incentivize the use of diverse native species over non-native species."

The Amazon is culturally, politically and socially diverse, encompassing large urbanized population centres and a matrix of remote rural communities. In this context, economic and political barriers present obstacles to aquaculture supply chains that promote equitable benefits sharing. For example, remoteness, high input costs, poor distribution infrastructure and lack of access to capital impede the profitability of small aquaculture farms throughout the Amazon. If left unaddressed, these logistical headwinds may favour conventionally intensified large aquaculture operators based on intermediary-controlled value chains that leverage economies of scale and ultimately concentrate wealth in a small subset of sector participants. Thus, aquaculture development policies that balance a diversity of both farmer-controlled and intermediary-controlled value chains are critical. Further, ensuring access to alternative livelihoods for actors who are displaced by expanding aquaculture is essential for just food system transitions, especially if aquaculture is to contribute to offsetting ecosystem impacts of other food systems. For example, cattle ranchers are already leveraging aquaculture to diversify their livelihoods, whereas wild-capture fisheries participants are not yet integrated into aquaculture, impeding the potential for farmed fish production to alleviate pressure on wild fisheries in the Amazon. Growing evidence from case studies across other developing aquaculture regions emphasizes a need to avoid policies that target small-scale or larger-scale aquaculture operators in isolation and rather highlight the need for integrative policy development that considers a diversity of producers and aquaculture-adjacent food sectors 64 ."

Widespread data deficiencies on the location of aquaculture operations and farm-level practices currently impede effective management and hamper opportunities to develop sustainable aquaculture policies in the Amazon. These deficiencies range from a lack of information on production statistics (for example, species cultivated, feed sources, disease incidence) and market dynamics to poorly accounted environmental footprint of aquaculture production (for example, GHG emissions, land-use conversion). This data deficiency represents a barrier to effectively scaling up our understanding from individual farms to the broader regional context of the sector's impact. Leveraging contemporary data generation and data processing technologies such as remote sensing, smart aquaculture equipment and artificial intelligence will enable more accurate assessments of environmental impacts and facilitate better management practices and tailored effective policy development. Although initiatives such as the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation's geoweb platform (SITE aquacultura, https://www.embrapa.br/en/site-aquicultura) represent efforts towards overcoming these limitations."

Aquaculture farms in most regions of the Amazon lack access to modern aquaculture technologies and practices, instead relying on traditional 'extensive' practices with low productivity and poor environmental performance 66 (Fig. 2). Modern aquaculture technologies such as bubblers that prevent deoxygenation of waters, feed control systems that minimize waste, and optimized rearing densities can reduce aquaculture's GHG footprint and simultaneously improve livelihoods by increasing farm-level production efficiency 70 . However, there is a risk that greater access to technology could drive intensification, potentially leading to increased land clearance in the pursuit of higher profitability. To mitigate this, strong regulatory frameworks and land-use planning will be essential to ensure sustainable intensification. Broadening access to technologies and knowledge requires both regional public investment in infrastructure as well as local support for farmers through extension and education programmes. Similarly, access to financing aimed to support farmer implementation of sustainable practices will be critical 71 . While long-term increases to public budgets for sustainable aquaculture management are unlikely, the 'conservation financing' space that harnesses private or publicprivate partnership investment strategies seeking dual ecological and investment returns holds great promise for mobilizing financial resources to promote sustainable aquaculture practices. Activity in the conservation finance space is already increasing in the mariculture sector 72 , and sector surveys indicate demand from potential investors for conservation investments in aquatic systems. However, a lack of investable projects currently hampers flows of capital towards projects that improve sustainable aquaculture development 73 . Greater cooperation across finance, aquaculture and environmental disciplines could help catalyse the development of investable sustainable aquaculture projects in the Amazon 74 ."

Embracing the core principles offered in the preceding will be key for building an enduring and resilient foundation towards sustainable aquaculture in the world's most biodiverse biome. Failure to adhere to these principles risks adding further strain to already vulnerable ecosystems. Inevitably, the course of aquaculture development will contrast sharply among regions, with some parts of the Amazon marked by large swaths of old-growth rainforest and others by the arc of deforestation. In the context of this regional variation, we have highlighted some of the major environmental and social impacts of Amazonian aquaculture, as well as some of its promises. However, it is crucial to recognize that aquaculture has historically contributed to intensification rather than alleviating pressures on other food systems, such as fisheries and livestock production. We conclude that for Amazonian aquaculture to be sustainable, it will require harmonizing environmental stewardship with the burgeoning need for food production in a manner that respects the unique biodiversity and cultural heritage of the region. Strong regulatory frameworks, land-use planning and careful management of intensification will be essential to prevent aquaculture from becoming an additive pressure in this fragile region."

Given the centrality of this relationship to aquaculture practices, a comprehensive understanding of how water quality dynamics influence fish behavior is imperative. While there have been some summaries of the effects of water quality parameters on fish physiology and growth, few reviews on their effects on fish behavior have been reported yet. This article reviews several water quality parameters which are of great concern in aquaculture from multiple facets of actual production, including physical parameters (water temperature and turbidity), chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, salinity, pH, and inorganic nitrogen), and chemical pollutants (microplastics and crude oil), which have gained increasing attention from the researchers and aquaculture practitioners over the past decades. Variations in these water quality parameters can exert profound effects on fish physiology, metabolism, internal tissues and organs, and sensory perception, which influences fish behaviors such as swimming, schooling, feeding, predation, anti-  predation, aggression, courtship, as well as adaptive and stress-  related behaviors such as exploration, avoidance response, and anxiety-  like behavior. By synthesizing the behavioral changes caused by specific water quality parameters, this review aims to provide strong support for further water quality-  related research, thereby fostering environments conducive to both fish welfare and aquaculture productivity."

For the past two decades, significant changes have been made in aquaculture production and management, which include the maintenance of traditional extensive aquaculture systems (e.g., pond, cage,  reservoir,  offshore  and  nearshore  aquaculture),  alongside the development of numerous innovative intensive aquaculture models (such as intensive cage, integrated aquaponics,"

For  example,  uneven  temperature gradients can prompt fish to abandon their schools in search of preferred thermal areas, trading the safety of the advantages of schooling for individual comfort [15]. Such intrinsic drive based on  environmental  preferences  underscores  how  water  quality fundamentally shapes fish behavior [16-19]. On the other hand, from a physiological standpoint, suboptimal water quality can lead  to  stress,  such  as  osmoregulatory  imbalance,  impaired organ  function  as  well  as  hindered  sensory  systems  [20-25], among other issues, all of which can directly or indirectly impact fish behavior, such as irregular feeding, hindered courting patterns,  reduced  exploration,  increased  aggression,  and  even anxiety-  like behavior [26-31]. Such impacts can also have implications for fish welfare, including poor overall health and the inability to perform normal behaviors freely. By monitoring fish behavior, the aquaculture industry can optimize resource utilization, regulate water quality, and assess the welfare of farmed fish  [32,  33].  Therefore,  comprehensively  examining  the  relationship between water quality parameters and fish behavior is crucial for improving aquaculture practices."

The  first  encompasses  extensive  outdoor  aquaculture, including  freshwater  pond/reservoir  aquaculture  along  with nearshore/offshore  marine  aquaculture;  the  second  category comprises  indoor,  intensive  aquaculture  systems,  with  a  primary focus herein on the increasingly popular RASs in recent years [54].  Marked by high densities, this mode of cultivation underscores the critical importance of collective behaviors and interindividual  interactions  as  pivotal  behavioral  indicators. While the majority of aquaculture practices involve monoculture, it is pertinent to acknowledge the existence of polyculture in certain non-  intensive outdoor systems, particularly prevalent in East and Southeast Asian regions, where multiple species are reared concurrently. Although the text primarily focuses on general implications, the inclusion of behaviors such as predation and antipredator  strategies  necessitates  this  acknowledgment. To preserve coherence and comprehensiveness, the discussion refrains from singling out specific aquaculture models, aiming instead to issue a broader alert relevant to the aquaculture sector and endeavors concerning fish welfare. Notably, not only aquaculture species were reviews here, some ornamental and wild species  were  also  adopted  to  supplement  the  relevant  views, which then provides valuable and comprehensive insights applicable to aquaculture."

Water  temperature fluctuations are common phenomena in aquaculture, even in the most controllable environment like indoor intensive aquaculture systems, where water temperature can still be disturbed by unexpected reasons like power failure and equipment malfunctions, let alone in extensive outdoor systems which are subject to the weather and climatic change; such variations in water temperature can impact fish to varying degrees, affecting behaviors  such  as  swimming,  schooling,  aggressive  behavior, exploratory  behavior,  courtship,  spawning,  and  predator-prey relationships, as detailed in the following section, reflecting the stress responses of fish to temperature changes (Figure\u00a01)."

Considering fish as ectothermic animals, water temperature  exerts  a  profound  influence  on  their  metabolic rates and energy allocation [62, 63]. Existing research indicates that lower water temperatures can reduce fish swimming velocities. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) acclimated to 28\u00b0C showed reduced swimming speeds at 24\u00b0C, while exposure to 30\u00b0C decreased immobility  duration  and  turning  angles  without  significantly altering  speed  [64].  On  the  other  hand,  when  water  temperature increases and surpass the optimal range for fish, increased oxygen consumption ensues, prompting fish to adopt a strategy of swimming slower to conserve energy [65]. The alteration of swimming  strategies  in  fish  due  to  temperature  changes  reflects  their  adaptive  capabilities  in  response  to  environmental shifts, yet it also indicates a compromise where they must adjust to maintain optimal conditions, thereby constraining their behavioral freedom and potentially impacting their welfare. It is noteworthy that the swimming strategies adopted by fish in response  to  temperature  fluctuations  are  heavily  influenced by  the  species  under  investigation  and  their  inherent  thermal  adaptation,  highlighting  the  significance  of  considering species-  specific and environmentally contextual factors in such research."

This, in turn, can impact the daily energetic budget of individuals and potentially impair the collective  response of the group when confronted with stressors.  Some researchers use interindividual distance (IID, referring to the mean distance between the focal fish and any other ones) and nearest neighbor distance (NND, referring to the distance between the focal fish and its closest neighbor) to quantify  fish  school  cohesion  [37,  66].  At  lower  temperatures,  fish schools  exhibit  higher  cohesion  in  many  species,  which  show smaller values of IID or NND.

Such  effects allow them to maintain higher school cohesion in cooler environments, which, for juveniles, can offset the increased energy expenditure  caused  by  the  higher  water  viscosity  associated with lower temperatures to some extent [59]. Conversely, as temperature increases, school cohesion may decrease slightly. For example, brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) fry showed increased IID with rising temperatures (4\u00b0C-10\u00b0C), with the NND increasing most  significantly  [66].  Such  effects  mean  that  swimming  in warmer water regions may prevent them from effectively utilizing  the  hydrodynamic benefits of  schooling,  thus  requiring them to expend more energy, although muscle contractility and efficiency are better in the warmer waters [59]."

When the environmental temperature is close to the preferred temperature, individuals spend more time in school [15].

In a study on mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis ), newborn fish raised at a lower temperature (25\u00b0C) showed different behavioral traits in adulthood: female fish exhibited repeated shyness and exploration, while male fish showed marginal repeated shyness, suggesting that environmental factors influencing fish in the early stage may shape behavior traits in adulthood; and mosquitofish reared at higher temperatures (30\u00b0C) were more exploratory  than  those  raised  at  lower  temperatures,  with  no difference  in  shyness  trait  [29].  The  promotion  of  exploratory behavior by higher temperature may be due to alterations in the central nervous system and modifications in protein synthesis and ATP production, as was pointed out in a serious of studies on zebrafish [49, 74, 75]. While it is inconclusive whether an increase or decrease in exploratory behavior is advantageous or detrimental to fish, as an increase in exploratory behavior may imply a higher likelihood of successful foraging despite a greater risk  of  predation  in  more  complex  outdoor  or  multi-  trophic aquaculture systems and may also increase the feeding rate in normal feeding process in aquaculture. From the perspective of fish  welfare,  to  promote  exploratory  behavior,  for  instance  by adding enrichment of aquaculture aquatic environment, signifies  an  increased  freedom  to  display  most  normal  behavioral patterns and enhancement of cognition and brain physiological functions [21, 76]."

In most aquaculture production, although aggression is a part of natural fish behavior, excessive aggressiveness is considered detrimental to production. That is because aggression  implies  extra  energy  expenditure  and  even  lead  to  injuries and death, causing reduction in profit [26, 43, 44], and fish that lose fights in the aggression may be unable to escape from their victors, in which case they will suffer from chronic stress, causing  impairments  in  welfare.  Decreasing  temperature  can alleviate the aggressive behavior of some fish species. In neotropical  cichlids  ( Cichlasoma  paranaense ),  which  can  tolerate temperatures up to 39\u00b0C, gradually reducing the water temperature by 6\u00b0C from an initial 27\u00b0C was found to decrease aggressive  behaviors  in  both  individual  fish  and  groups;  conversely, when  the  water  temperature  was  gradually  increased  by  6\u00b0C from the same starting point of 27\u00b0C, no significant change in aggressive behavior was observed among the fish [77]. Similar conclusions were drawn in matrinx\u00e3 ( Brycon amazonicus ) juvenile fish, where compared with the control group temperature (28.33\u00b0C \u00b1 0.12\u00b0C),  lower  temperature  (24.09\u00b0C \u00b1 0.15\u00b0C)  reduced the aggression of juvenile fish [78]. In general, alleviating the aggressive behavior of fish provides a less variable growth environment for fish individuals and decreases disease to some extent, which is beneficial for fish welfare in aquaculture [26]."

Spawning,  the  process  of releasing  eggs,  exhibits  diverse  behaviors  across  species.  In meagre  ( Argyrosomus  regius ), spawning-  related  chorusing is  strongest  at  an  average  water  temperature  of  15\u00b0C-25\u00b0C, peaking around 18\u00b0C, with drastic temperature changes causing the chorus to stop [87]. Furthermore, water temperature impacts fish spawning through its effects on reproductive hormones. For example, high temperatures can reduce spawning capacity  in  clownfish  ( Amphiprion  melanopus )  due  to  the thermal  sensitivity  of  reproductive  hormones  [88],  and  lowtemperature stress can lower reproductive behavior in guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ) due to a reduction in reproductive-  related traits [89].

Reduced predation efficiency and feeding rates, which can lead to declining yields, are undesirable in aquaculture. Fortunately, some fish have developed strategies to cope with the challenges posed by high turbidity. When visual information acquisition is limited by increased turbidity,  some  fish  rely  more  on  their  olfactory  senses  to  detect chemical cues, known as sensitivity plasticity [19, 96]. For example,  zebrafish  exposed  to  a  turbid  environments  showed a weaker response to visual stimuli but a stronger response to olfactory  stimuli,  indicating  a  shift  in  their  primary  sensory mode [19]. However, for predation, chemical cues may persist long after the prey leave, making them somewhat inaccurate, whereas visual signals can accurately and quickly grasp the position of prey [97]. Therefore, for the fish that rely on olfaction, lack the visual cues can lead to more cautious decision-  making as well due to the sense of fear [97]. Losing the freedom from fear can severely compromise their welfare in normal life."

Such slower feeding response in  low-  turbidity  water  may  not  be  due  to  visual  impairment but rather to low turbidity stress, as pikeperch naturally prefer dimmer  environments  for  foraging  [98].

In polyculture models rearing several species of fish, especially in traditional pond aquaculture, turbidity can affect the predation and antipredation  behaviors  of  fish,  which  is  related  to  the  natural growth of mixed fish and affects the stability of the aquaculture ecosystem. In turbid water, visual cues are hindered, prompting some fish to behave more cautiously and increase their risk perception [94].  For  example,  mosquitofish reduced their activity and exploration in response to predator cues in turbid environments [100],  and  Stymphalia  minnow ( Pelasgus stymphalicus ) exposed to turbid environment exhibited hesitancy and reduced activity when leaving artificial refuges, even in the absence of predator cues [101]. These studies suggest that turbidity may elevate perceived predation risk and decrease exploratory behavior in prey species. However, the effect of turbidity on the prey is not always negative. Juvenile fish can benefit from high turbidity because suspended particles can form a protective cover, which allows them to conceal themselves and reduce predation pressure [23]. A study has found that Japanese anchovy ( Engraulis japonicus ) larvae in the high-  turbidity group (300 mg/L kaolin) showed  significantly  higher  survival  rate  when  exposed  to predators jack mackerel ( Trachurus japonicus )  compared with the ones in the low-  turbidity groups (0, 50 mg/L kaolin) [102]. Additionally, it should be noted that whether turbid water can act as a protective cover depends on the habitat of the fish [103]. If fish live in water with almost no shelter, high turbidity may be beneficial and their survival rate may be increased. To some extent, these phenomena reflect the diverse effects of turbidity on predation."

Some fish species use colorful appearances to attract mates, such as guppy [28] and cichlid [104]. However, excessive turbidity can impair visual cues, affecting the courting process. For example, male guppy displayed bright colors to court females but exhibited less frequent courting behavior in turbid water compared with clear-  water conditions, which hinders  female  mate  selection  [28].  Turbidity  negatively  impacts visual acuity and the effectiveness of visual communication in aquatic  systems  by  obscuring  visual  cues,  leading  to  reduced social  interaction  time  between  male  and  female  individuals within the fish group [105]. While visual cues become limited in turbid water, some fish still can use olfactory signals to compensate during courting. In a mate selection experiment with three-  spined  sticklebacks  ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ),  females  relied more on visual cues than olfactory cues in clear water but shifted to relying more on olfactory cues in organic turbid water containing algae ( Isochrysis sp.) [106]. This finding may suggest that  fish  can  adjust  their  reliance  on  different  cues  based  on environmental conditions when conducting courting behavior, choosing the most informative cues available."

In  aquaculture  production, large  inputs  of  feed,  excessive  stocking  density,  failure  to  use aerators can lead to a decrease in DO [109]. DO is more uncontrollable in extensive aquaculture systems than that in intensive mode, given the impact of weather changes. As an example, in the  rainy  season,  extensive  pond  aquaculture  experiences  reduced water solubility of oxygen, a consequence of inadequate sunlight exposure [110]. Additionally, seasonal environmental conditions such as summer thermal stratification and winter ice cover affect the distribution of DO in open water as well [111]. Under condition with oxygen deficiency, or hypoxia, fish maintain their oxygen uptake at the level of the standard metabolic rate  (SMR),  the  minimum  required  for  basic  functions  [112]. This may lead to respiratory difficulties, impaired movement, reduced appetite, and physiological responses, which then results in behavioral changes (Figure\u00a03). Noted that, oxygen supersaturation, or hyperoxia, has been proved that it can pose a risk of physiological issues or diseases such as bubble gas disease in salmon [113, 114], highlighting the necessity for the appropriate DO management on species-  specific (freshwater or marine) and  system-  dependent  (intensive  or  extensive  environments) condition.

Fast-  start  happens  at  the  point  of  preys  sensing  predator  signals and predators starting to hunt after finding targets. Most researchers divide fast-  start into two stages: (1) First body bend (C- or S-  shaped) caused by muscle contractions. This stage begins at the start of the sensing signals and ends when the head stops turning or changes direction. (2) Second body bend, which begins at the end of stage one and ends when the head stops turning or changes direction [126]. Fast-  start movements, executed under anaerobic metabolism, rely on anaerobic muscle energy for  sudden  acceleration  to  maximum speed, and it was previously believed that hypoxia does not affect this escape movement [127]. However, certain performance-  related escape behaviors, such as responsiveness and directionality, are related to brain and sensory functions and are negatively affected by hypoxia. This not only affects the capacity to perceive predators (i.e., vigilance against predators) [128], but also the capacity to judge direction during the escape process. For instance, the avoidance and approach responses of sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) were random  when  escaping  responses  occurred  when  the  oxygen level  dropped  to  or  below  50%  oxygen  saturation,  suggesting impaired  direction  discrimination  mediated  by  mechanosensory systems [129]. Furthermore, escape responses are often incomplete under hypoxia, favoring single-  bend responses due to their lower energy costs, which have been suggested to be more common under conditions of reduced swimming performance [126]. Noted that, although escape is powered by anaerobic metabolism, it requires an aerobic recovery phase, which may be limited by hypoxia in fish, resulting in severe oxygen debt and constraining the ability to perform repeated fast-  starts [130]."

Despite this, while hypoxia may not necessarily increase the probability of fish being preyed upon by other fish, predators unaffected by water oxygen levels, such as birds and aquatic mammals, may exploit the disadvantages of fish escaping under hypoxic conditions to hunt them [84, 125], such as when fish engaging in ASR. To mitigate this risk, some fish adopt strategies as part of their antipredator behavior, such as surfacing irregularly or synchronously with other fish to reduce predation risk [134].  Fathead  minnows  ( Pimephales  promelas ),  for  instance, dive  swiftly  below  the  surface  upon  detecting  alarm  signals while engaging in ASR and quickly return to the surface without  reducing  their  activity\u00a0 [111].

Thus, schooling involves a tradeoff between individual oxygen demand and interest demand such as hydrodynamic benefits. In fish schools, different individuals occupy distinct positions in the school at different times as shuffling frequently occurs during school movement [135], thus enabling hypoxic individuals to move to areas with relatively more oxygen. Under this circumstance, hypoxia has a great impact on fish school size. As water oxygen concentration  decreases,  the  volume  of  the  school  expands  particularly in width instead in length, because fish at the same horizontal level can obtain hydrodynamic advantages, by which fish can save swimming cost more easily and the phenomena that fish at the rear become increasingly hypoxic may be prevented [136]. As the oxygen concentration decreases further, the schools continue to expand until they reach a certain point, at which point they may disperse and break down into several smaller schools to  better  cope with hypoxia [117]. These findings suggest that oxygen continually regulates fish schooling and is an important factor in determining schooling capacity."

When confronted with inappropriate salinity, fish need to balance the requirement to maintain their current osmotic balance with the need to relocate in order to alleviate stress, based on their adaptive osmoregulation strategies [150]. To mitigate salinity stress, fish must have an accurate perception of their surroundings, such as the ability to sense changes in ambient sodium and chloride levels, and the capacity to migrate away from high-  stress areas promptly [151, 152]. However, when the water salinity exceeds the tolerance threshold of fish, the dehydration and declined swimming capacity come to fish so that they may not be able to migrate from high-  stress areas to  preference location [145], even if they are able to sense the salinity stress in this case."

Moreover,  salinity  not  only  interact  with the olfactory receptors but also be associated with the change in the expression of genes related to olfaction, demonstrated in a study on salmonid fish migration [153]. Salinity plays a vital role in this important life cycle due to its influence on spawning related  physiological  activity,  encompassing  the  release  of  related hormone, such as cortisol, and the olfactory-  related memories during migration [153]. Significant fluctuations in salinity during this process can impact migration, indirectly affecting the spawning success.

Some species are highly sensitive to environmental pH levels; for example, land-  locked sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) will attempt to avoid areas with pH levels below 6.0 during their upstream migration, even in response to slight pH changes [157]. Furthermore, Brook Char ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) and Arctic Char ( Salvelinus alpinus ) were also found that they exhibited avoidance responses to unsuitably low pH environments  (&lt; 5.5)  [158,  159].  Thus,  it  has  been  speculated that salmon may be able to perceive the pH of their surroundings and respond accordingly [157]. Nevertheless, the impact of pH on fish behavior extends beyond these direct effects: acidified water can impair the olfactory senses to response to chemical cues in most fish species, consequently altering behaviors that are ordinarily guided by olfaction [24, 160, 161]."

For  example,  due  to  the  potential issue that olfactory neurones are impaired and olfactory sensitivity  to  chemical  cues  is  reduced  under  acidic  conditions,  orange clownfish ( Amphiprion percula ) were found to be unable to effectively use olfactory cues to locate their habitat under simulated acidified conditions (pH7.6), compared with conditions under seawater (pH8.15) [165]; similarly, fathead minnows, finescale dace ( Phoxinus neogaeus ), and rainbow trout struggled to detect conspecific alarm cues under mildly acidic conditions (pH6.0),  compared  with  normal  pH  conditions  (pH7.0-7.2) [166]. Importantly, such olfactory dysfunction may persist over extended durations, even after leaving from the acidic areas, observed in a study in which fathead minnows failed to exhibit feeding responses typically elicited by strong chemical stimuli after returning to their original habitat (pH8.1) after exposure to an acidic environment (pH6.0) for 72 h, indicating a lingering effect on their chemosensory capabilities [160]. These phenomena occur not only in acidic water but also in water that experiences pH fluctuations caused by precipitation, which can temporarily lead to a sluggish response of fish to alarm signals, as found in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) [163]. In addition to impaired olfactory neurons, fish in acidic environments may experience degraded chemical cues [24] or reduced affinity of these cues for odorant receptors [167], which can transmit incorrect information or obstruct information transmission, leading to a loss of  the  capacity  to  make  correct  decisions.  For  instance,  when eggs  and  larvae  of  clownfish  were  exposed  to  simulated  acid seawater (pH7.8), they lost the capacity to distinguish between predators and non-  predators and were strongly attracted to the smell of predators [161], which alters antipredator behaviors and elevates the likelihood of predation, profoundly disadvantaging their healthy development."

The initial behavioral responses of fish acutely exposed to excessive ammonia levels include reducing or stopping feeding [176, 183]. Loss of appetites have been observed in fish exposed to external ammonia, such as rainbow trout [179] and Mediterranean barbel ( Barbus meridionalis )  [184]. This may be because the decomposition of ingested proteins can lead to a sudden increase in ammonia levels inside the body. Under excessive ammonia, the excretion of ammonia through the gills is inhibited and ammonia may even diffuse into the fish body from the outside [185], resulting in the rapid accumulation of ammonia inside the body [186].  Therefore,  reduced  food  intake  as  an  efficient  strategy could  protect  fish  from  significant  further  increases  in  postprandial blood ammonia level to minimize toxic effects [183]. In addition to food intake, ammonia production in fish can be also attributed to stress and increased metabolism caused by stress  and  exercise  [176,  187].  In  this  situation  under  acutely excessive environmental ammonia stress, another strategy for fish to prevent the rapid accumulation of ammonia is to reduce exercise  [176].  For  example,  rainbow  trout  and  zebrafish  exposed to excessive ammonia levels exhibited reduced activity levels and decreased aggressive behavior [188, 189]. However, the  effects  of  acute  exposure  to  environmental  ammonia  in fish contrast with those of chronic exposure, wherein the stress persists over an extended period. Unlike acute exposure, when chronically exposed to environmental ammonia, satiated fish demonstrated  higher  efficiency  in  excreting  ammonia  than hungry  fish  and  experienced  relatively  less  ammonia  stress during  exercise,  with  less  accumulation  of  ammonia  in  the blood, compared with starved fish [190, 191]. This may be attributed to the possibility that feeding increases the metabolic rate of fish and leads to an elevated oxygen consumption rate, ultimately  promoting  ammonia excretion [191].  Such  mechanisms indicate that  fish  have  behavioral  strategies  to  reduce ammonia toxicity when exposed to acute or chronic nonlethal ammonia levels. As exposure time prolongs, the involvement of Rh glycoproteins and certain ion channels helps re-  establish the process of ammonia excretion [192]. This physiological regulation facilitates the recovery of ammonia excretion capability [185],  thereby  mitigating  behavioral  changes  observed  under ammonia stress, such as reduced appetite [179], decreased activity levels, and diminished aggression [189]."

The accumulation of ammonia in muscle tissue, especially in white glycolytic muscles which enable fish to acquire a large amount of energy within a short time through anaerobic metabolism, can cause muscle damage and affect energy supply [186]. And the accumulation in the brain can significantly impair the reflex arc neural function and related sensory systems in  fish  [193],  which  can  greatly  result  in  a  reduction  in  the response ability as well as directional confusion during movement [186].  In  addition,  it  was  also  observed  that  ammonia can damage the lateral line sensory system which is essential for  perceiving  environmental  information.  All  these  effects mentioned above can lead to difficulties in maintaining optimal  behavior  performance,  including  normal  swimming performance, predation and anti-  predation [194, 195], placing fish  at  a  disadvantage  in  competitive  relationships  between different species (or inter-  species relationship), as observed in a study on brown trout, where a decrease in swimming performance after ammonia exposure led to a significant reduction in capture success [186]. Notably, ammonia cannot only affect inter-  species relationships but may also have an impact on community structure within the same species, which manifest as hierarchical structures within the same species group [186, 189]. This is evident in a study on rainbow trout, where hierarchical  structure  could  be  maintained  at  relatively  low ammonia concentration, with a decline in activity levels manifested as reduced aggression, but the stable structure no longer existed at higher ammonia concentration [189]. Although these sublethal effects mentioned above may not directly lead to death, fish may loss the capacity to cope with or adapt to environmental variations."

One of the reasons is that nitrite exposure can impact the olfactory system and ability  to  detect  food  [210],  leading  to  a  slow  feeding  rate  and,  in  some  cases,  cessation  of  responses  to  food [209]. In addition, exposure to nitrite can impair the oxygen uptake capacity of fish as well [205]. The most noticeable behavioral  manifestations  in  aquaculture  include  gasping  at the  water  surface,  with  excessive  respiration,  and  frequent gill covers flipping [205, 211], resulting from nitrite converting hemoglobin into methemoglobin, which cannot transport oxygen as hemoglobin does [206]. Consequently, even when the DO content in aquaculture water reaches optimal levels, affected  fish  may  frequently  exhibit  signs  of  hypoxia  [206]. These physiological effects can significantly affect health and can manifest through behavioral performance [212], such as decreased  swimming  speed,  as  observed  in  striped  catfish ( Pangasianodon  hypophthalmus ) [213],  catla  ( Labeo  catla ), rohu ( Labeo rohita ), and mrigal ( Cirrhinus mrigala ) [211]."

Nowadays, MPs are widely distributed globally and difficult to degrade, and some break down into  smaller,  harder-  to-  detect  particles  known  as  nanoplastics [218, 219]. Owing to their small size, MPs easily attach to parts of fish such as gills, skin, and be taken in through respiration and digestion [214, 220, 221]. As is reported, microplastic particles have been found in the digestive systems of captive and wildcaught fish in the ocean [222], even in the stomachs of polar cods in the Arctic ecosystem [223]. Once inside the fish body, MPs may spread through the bloodstream to various body areas, leading to stress from oxidation, metabolic problems, weakened immune function and hindered growth [219, 224, 225]. More concerning, MPs in fish bodies can be transferred through the food chain from  low  to  high  trophic  level  organisms  [226,  227],  causing negative impacts and posing serious health risks and ecological security issues (Figure\u00a06). The wide range of these impacts has made it a vital topic in the field of aquaculture [228, 229]."

Studies on  zebrafish  and  common  goby  ( Pomatoschistus  microps ) [230, 231] reveal that the presence of MPs alongside food reduces fish discernment, leading to increased MPs consumption, especially as food abundance rises. Feeding habits also influence MPs intake; fish that swallow whole prey consume more MPs compared with those fed by filter or suction feeders [232],  and  piscivorous fish are more prone to MPs ingestion than those feeding on crustaceans or gelatinous zooplankton [233]. Furthermore, personality of individual fish affects MPs uptake as well, as exemplified by bolder zebrafish consuming more MPs than their shyer counterparts [234]. However, some fish possess mechanisms to minimize the ingestion of microplastics. Species relying on chemosensory cues for feeding can better discriminate against nonedible particles [220] and some fish, like hybrid groupers, utilize both visual and taste senses to  distinguish  MPs  from  edible  items  [235],  although  fish that  specialize  in  visually  hunting  small  prey-  like  plankton may confuse MPs for food, especially under starvation conditions [220].

The severity of these effects correlates with MP size, with smaller MPs having greater impacts. Micron-  sized plastics can be ingested and expelled [227]. However,  smaller  MPs,  or  even  nanoplastics,  can  accumulate in the organs like gills, liver and intestines [214], causing various  damage,  inducing  inhibiting  enzyme  activity,  oxidative stress  metabolic  changes,  and  affecting  energy  distribution [214,  240,  241],  severely  compromising  multiple  physiological functions and leading to alterations in fish behavior to varying degrees as following."

Smaller MPs, particularly nanoplastics, pose heightened risks due to their larger specific surface area (the ratio of surface area to volume) and enhanced penetration capabilities, facilitating cellular absorption and interaction with organisms [245], leading to potentially more severe outcomes, as demonstrated in a study, in which goldfish larvae exposed to 1000 \u03bcg/L  nanoplastics  for  3 days  exhibited  markedly  reduced swimming speeds, with further decreases noted after 1 week at both 100 and 1000 \u03bcg/L exposure levels [214]."

European sea bass larvae exposed to weathered crude oil and dispersant at 80 mg/L for 1 month showed reduced hypoxia tolerance and swimming capacity [260]. Moreover, crude oil exposure also alters calcium cycling in skeletal muscles [261, 262] and decreases muscle mitochondrial function [254, 255], constraining swimming ability and impacting social competition [263]."

Nearly a year after embryonic oil exposure, adult zebrafish showed abnormal changes in heart shape during growth and significantly reduced swimming capacity [265]. A similar phenomenon was observed in mahi-  mahi [264], as exposure of embryos and larvae to 1.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/L \u03a3PAHs for 48 h and then developing them to juveniles or directly exposure juveniles to 30 \u00b1 7 \u03bcg/L \u03a3PAHs for 24 h led to significant 37% and 22% decreases  in  the  critical  swimming  speed,  respectively.

Active and exploratory behavior represents  boldness,  which  often  emphasizes  rewards  rather than risks; in contrast, spending more time swimming in\u00a0situ, staying closer to the habitat, and exhibiting low activity represent anxiety-  like behavior, which emphasizes safety rather than potential rewards [269]. In a series of studies, researchers observed that zebrafish exhibited decreased anxiety-  like behavior and engaged in more exploratory behavior after exposure to crude oil or its components, suggesting an increase in boldness. For example, zebrafish preferred to stay in the center of the arena after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene [267]. However, exposure to crude oil does not always promote exploratory behavior and inhibit anxiety-  like behaviors. Some studies have shown that exposure to different components of crude oil mixtures can increase anxiety-  like behavior in fish and decrease exploratory behavior. For example, zebrafish exposed to two PAH mixtures (one from pyrolysis and one  from  light  crude  oil)  [270]  and  the  water-  soluble  fraction (WSF) of crude oil [271] showed increased anxiety-  like behaviors.

                "text": "Aquaculture  systems  require  tailored  water  quality  management. Outdoor extensive systems, due to their susceptibility to disturbance  and  environmental  complexity,  witness  a  wider array  of  behavior-  modulating  effects,  necessitating  intricate assessments of diverse water quality parameters and behaviors tailored to variable environments. In contrast, intensive indoor systems like RAS, with greater water quality management, the dynamics of these behaviors assume critical importance. Given the link between water quality and fish behavior, understanding these patterns is crucial for sustainable aquaculture management and fish welfare. While fish behavior holds a wealth of  information  regarding  water  quality  and  fish  welfare  in aquaculture systems, the practical implementation of behavior monitoring  for  enhanced  production  and  welfare  assurance currently faces notable challenges and incurs substantial costs. Nonetheless, propelled by technological advancements and the global emphasis on fish welfare and sustainability, the utilization  of  fish  behavior  as  a  tool  for  assessing  water  quality  and estimating  fish  welfare  in  aquaculture  is  emerging  as  an  increasingly prominent trend."

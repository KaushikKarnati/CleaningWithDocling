## ASC Chain of Custody Module -Official Release Statement 30 May 2022

The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) today released its new ASC Chain of Custody (CoC) Module.

The CoC Module contains new mandatory requirements for ASC CoC certificate holders and Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) to enhance the integrity of ASC CoC certified products, provide greater value and a higher level of assurance to programme participants and buyers who rely on the ASC logo.

As of the effective date, 30 May 2023, the CoC Module requirements will apply in addition to the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) CoC requirements for ASC farmed seafood products.  The foundation of ASC supply chain assurance continues to be provided by MSC CoC certification as part of one streamlined certification process, maintaining efficiencies for companies trading both ASC and MSC certified seafood.

The ASC CoC Module scheme document is owned by ASC and contains supplementary requirements to the MSC CoC Standard versions, Certification Requirements, General Certification Requirements and MSC Vocabulary. Existing requirements of these documents are unaffected by the introduction of the Module.

The Module is normative for all ASC CoC certificate holders and CABs for chain of custody audits with ASC products in scope starting from 30 May 2023. CABs accredited to conduct MSC CoC audits must apply for a scope extension with the appointed accreditation body.

The CoC Module was developed through a comprehensive and transparent process involving a 60-day public consultation period, reporting of feedback and revisions, and approval by ASC governance bodies.

For  more  information,  please  visit  the  ASC  website . Enquiries  may  be  directed  to  assurance@ascaqua.org.

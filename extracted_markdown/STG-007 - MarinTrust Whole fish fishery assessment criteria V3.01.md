## Foreword

MarinTrust1 is the leading independent business to business certification programme for the marine ingredients value chain. Responsible sourcing and manufacturing is vital if marine ingredients are to remain a relevant ingredient in feed for culture, agriculture, pet care and directly in the production of consumer products, including cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Fishmeal and fish oil make up the largest share of marine ingredients today, however all marine ingredients are included in MarinTrust's scope.

To enable stakeholders to credibly demonstrate the commitment to responsible practice in areas of feed safety, raw material procurement, delivery, and throughout the production process, MarinTrust developed a robust Certification Programme, consisting of three main components:

The MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients: The verification and certification of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from approved fisheries and by-product species.

The MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard: The verification and certification of the chain of custody for marine ingredients (products) that come from MarinTrust certified factories along the value chain to the customer.

The Improver Programme: The verification and approval of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from accepted MarinTrust Improver fisheries.

The initial MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients (the 'Standard') was finalised  and  the  programme opened  for  applications  in  October  2009,  with  the  first  factory receiving IFFO RS (now known as MarinTrust) certification in February 2010. Version 2.0 was launched in July 2017.

The Standard and raw material (whole fish and by-product) assessment requirements have since been regularly  revised  in  line  with  relevant  international  norms,  such  as  those  set  by  the  International Organisation for Standardization (ISO/IEC 170652, ISO/IEC 170673) and the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling (ISEAL)4. This ongoing process ensures that the Standard remains accessible, credible, and relevant to industry needs, and in particular that the assessment process continues to be robust.

Revisions  are  undertaken  by  a  series  of  expert  committees  within  the  MarinTrust  governance structure5.  These  committees  represent  the  full  marine  ingredient  value  chain,  including  marine ingredient producers, feed processors, fisheries and aquaculture standard holders and retailers as well as fisheries experts, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

## Introduction

## Governance

The MarinTrust programme is overseen by the MarinTrust Governing Body Committee (GBC), which is responsible for the continued advancement of the MarinTrust standards to ensure they remain both credible and relevant with respect to the stated objectives. The MarinTrust Fisheries Development Oversight Committee is responsible for the continued advancement of the MarinTrust raw material assessment (whole fish and by-product) requirements.

The MarinTrust Governing Body Committee has endorsed Version 3.0 of the MarinTrust whole fish fishery  assessment  criteria.  Throughout  the  development of  Version 3.0,  the needs of  the marine ingredients  value  chain  and  interested  parties  have  been  at  the  centre  to  ensure  effective representation throughout.

## About this document

This document defines what shall be achieved for the approval of whole fish raw material against the 'MarinTrust  Global  Standard  for  Responsible  Supply  of  Marine  Ingredients    Version  3.0'  (the 'Standard').

## Responsible raw material sourcing

As an essential prerequisite to the audit against the MarinTrust Standard, facilities must demonstrate that they source approved raw materials (whole fish or by-products) that are:

- · Not from Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity
- · Not an endangered species
- · For whole fish, from responsibly managed fisheries aligned with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries

## Scope and applicability

This document outlines the assessment criteria for responsibly sourcing wild caught whole fish raw materials used to produce MarinTrust certified marine ingredients.

These criteria apply to whole fish from human consumption sources as defined in the MarinTrust Standard.

Source fisheries cannot make a claim against the MarinTrust Standard.

The fishery under assessment is defined at a minimum by the wild capture species, fishing area and fishing gear.

## Normative references

This document draws upon the following normative documents:

- · United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 1982.
- · FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO CCRF). 1995.

## Whole fish fishery assessment criteria

## Whole fish fishery assessment requirements

- 1.1. Species cannot be approved for use as a MarinTrust raw material if the species:
- 1.1.1. Is a marine mammal, reptile, amphibian or bird, or
- 1.1.2. Stems from fisheries that use dynamiting, poisoning and other comparable destructive fishing practices, or
- 1.1.3. Appears in CITES Appendix 1 or 2 , or 7
- 1.1.4. Is categorised as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List . 8
- 1.2. No materials from illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity shall be used as MarinTrust raw material.
- 1.3. Total annual catch estimates shall be used to identify the species composition and to determine the relevant species category against which each species in the fishery should be assessed (clause 1.4).
- 1.3.1. Endangered, threatened, or protected species (ETP species) are considered separately (under the Ecosystem section), irrespective of their frequency of occurrence in the catch.
- 1.3.2. Species which make up less than 0.1% of catches do not need to be assessed.
- 1.4. The species in the catch are assessed as follows:
- 1.4.1. Type 1 Species can be considered the 'target' or 'main' species in the fishery under assessment. They make up the bulk of catch and are subjected to a detailed assessment.
- 1.4.1.1. Type 1 species must represent at least 95% of the total annual catch. 1.4.1.2. If a species-specific management regime is in place for a Type 1 species, it shall be assessed under Category A.
- 1.4.1.3. If there is no species-specific management regime in place for a Type 1 species, it shall be assessed under Category B.
- 1.4.2. Type 2 Species can be considered the 'non target' species in the fishery -under assessment. They comprise a small proportion of the annual catch and are subjected to a relatively high-level assessment.
- 1.4.2.1.
- Type 2 species may represent a maximum of 5% of the annual catch.
- 1.4.2.2. If a species-specific management regime is in place for a Type 2 species, it shall be assessed under Category C.
- 1.4.2.3. If there is no species-specific management regime in place for a Type 2 species, it shall be assessed under Category D.
- 1.5. For a whole fish fishery to be MarinTrust approved, all assessment criteria shall achieve a ' pass  determination. '
- 1.5.1. If a single criterion fails, the whole fish fishery shall not be approved.
- 1.5.1.1.

## Whole fish fishery assessment criteria

## 1. Management requirements

This section assesses the general management regime applied to the fishery under assessment.

1.6.

All management criteria must be met (pass) for a fishery to pass the Management

Requirements.

- 1.6.1. The sub-criteria offer a structured evidence base to demonstrate that the fishery sufficiently meets the management criteria. It is not expected that sub-criteria are assessed independently of the main criterion.

## M1 Management Framework

- M1.1 There is an organisation responsible for managing the fishery.

In reaching a determination for M1.1, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M1.1.1   The management and administration organisations within the fishery are clearly identified.
- M1.1.2  The functions and responsibilities of the management organisations include the overall regulation, administration, science and data collection and enforcement roles, and are documented and publicly available.
- M1.1.3  Fishers have access to information and/or training materials through nationally recognised organisations.
- M1.2 Fishery management organisations are legally empowered to take management actions.

In reaching a determination for M1.2, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M1.2.1  There are legal instruments in place to give authority to the management organisation(s) which can include policies, regulations, acts or other legal mechanisms.
- M1.2.2   Vessels wishing to participate in the fishery must be authorised by the management organisation(s).
- M1.2.3  The management system has a mechanism in place for the resolution of legal disputes.
- M1.2.4  There is evidence of the legal rights of people dependent on fishing for food or livelihood.
- M1.3 There is an organisation responsible for collecting data and (scientifically) assessing the fishery.

In reaching a determination for M1.3, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M1.3.1  The organisation(s) responsible for collecting data and assessing the fishery is/are clearly identified.
- M1.3.2  The management system receives scientific advice regarding stock, non-target species and ecosystem status.
- M1.3.3  Scientific advice is independent from the management organisation(s) and transparent in its formulation through a clearly defined process.

<!-- image -->

- M1.4 The fishery management system is based on the principles of sustainable fishing and a precautionary approach.
- In reaching a determination for M1.4, the assessor should consider if the following is in place: M1.4.1  A policy or long-term management objective for sustainable harvesting based on the best scientific evidence and a precautionary approach is publicly available and implemented for the fishery.
- M1.5 There is a clearly defined decision-making process which is transparent, with processes and results made publicly available.

In reaching a determination for M1.5, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M1.5.1  There is participatory engagement through which fishery stakeholders and other stakeholders can access, provide information, consult with, and respond to, the management systems' decision -making process.
- M1.5.2  The decision-making process is transparent, with results made publicly available.
- M1.5.3  The fishery management system is subject to periodic internal or external review to validate the decision-making process, outcomes and scientific data.

## M2 Surveillance, Control and Enforcement

- M2.1 There is an organisation responsible for monitoring compliance with fishery laws and regulations.

In reaching a determination for M2.1 the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M2.1.1  There is an organisation responsible for monitoring compliance with specific monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) mechanisms in place.
- M2.1.2  There are relevant tools or mechanisms used to minimise IUU fishing activity.
- M2.1.3  There is evidence of monitoring and surveillance activity appropriate to the intensity, geography, management control measures and compliance behaviour of the fishery.
- M2.2 There is a framework of sanctions which are applied when infringements against laws and regulations are discovered.

In reaching a determination for M2.2, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M2.2.1  The laws and regulations provide for penalties or sanctions that are adequate in severity to act as an effective deterrent.
- M2.2.2  There is no evidence of systematic non-compliance.
- M2.3 There is substantial evidence of widespread compliance in the fishery, and no substantial evidence of IUU fishing.

In reaching a determination for M2.3, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- M2.3.1  The level of compliance is documented and updated routinely, statistically reviewed and available.
- M2.3.2  Fishers provide additional information and cooperate with management/enforcement agencies/organisations to support the effective management of the fishery.

M2.3.3  The catch recording and reporting system is sufficient for effective traceability of catches per vessel and supports the prevention of IUU fishing.

## 2. Species requirements

Each species in the catch is subject to an assessment in this section (see clauses 1.2 and 1.3). Category A species

- 2.1. All clauses must be met for a species to pass the Category A assessment.
- 2.1.1. If a species fails any of the Category A clauses, it should be re-assessed as a Category B species.

## A1 Data collection

- A1.1 Landings data are collected such that the fishery-wide removals of this species are known.
- A1.2 Sufficient additional information is collected to enable an indication of stock status to be estimated.

## A2 Stock assessment

- A2.1 A stock assessment is conducted at least once every 3 years (or every 5 years if there is substantial supporting information that this is sufficient for the long-term sustainable management of the stock) and considers all fishery removals and the biological characteristics of the species.
- A2.2 The assessment provides an estimate of the status of the biological stock relative to a reference point or proxy.
- A2.3 The assessment provides an indication of the volume of fishery removals which is appropriate for the current stock status.
- A2.4 The assessment is subject to internal or external peer review.
- A2.5 The assessment is made publicly available.

## A3 Harvest strategy

- A3.1 There is a mechanism in place by which total fishing mortality of this species is restricted.
- A3.2 Total fishery removals of this species do not regularly exceed the level indicated or stated in the stock assessment. Where a specific quantity of removals is recommended, the actual removals may exceed this by up to 10% ONLY if the stock status is above the limit reference point or proxy.
- A3.3 Commercial fishery removals are prohibited when the stock has been estimated to be below the limit reference point or proxy (small quotas for research or non-target catch of the species in other fisheries are permissible).

## A4 Stock status

- A4.1 The stock is at or above the target reference point; OR IF NOT: the stock is above the limit reference point or proxy and there is evidence that a fall below the limit reference point would result in fishery closure; OR IF NOT: the stock is estimated to be below the limit reference point or proxy, but fishery removals are prohibited.

## Category B species

Category B species are assessed using a risk-based approach.

- 2.2. The risk matrix in Table B(a) shall be used when assessing a Category B species when estimates of Fishing mortality (F), Biomass (B) and reference points are available.
- 2.3. The risk matrix in Table B(b) shall be used when assessing a Category B species when no reference points are available.

## Category C species

- 2.4. All clauses must be met for a species to pass the Category C assessment.
- 2.4.1. Where a species fails this Category C clause, it should be assessed as a Category D species instead, except if there is evidence that the species is currently below the limit reference point.
- C1.1 Fishery removals of the species in the fishery under assessment are included in the stock assessment process OR are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible.
- C1.2 The species is considered, in its most recent stock assessment, to have a biomass above the limit reference point (or proxy), OR removals by the fishery under assessment are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible.

## Category D species

Category D species are assessed against a risk-based approach.

- 2.5. The Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) in Table D(a) shall be used when assessing Category D species.
- 2.6. Table D(b) shall be used to calculate the overall PSA risk rating for the Category D species.
- 2.7. Should the PSA indicate a high risk, further assessment shall be completed against the requirements in Table D(c).

## 3. Ecosystem requirements

This section assesses the impacts that the fishery under assessment may have on key ecosystem components: ETP species, habitat and the wider ecosystem.

- 3.1. All ecosystem criteria must be met (pass) for a fishery to pass the Ecosystem Requirements.
- 3.1.1. The sub-criteria offer a structured evidence base to demonstrate that the fishery sufficiently meets the ecosystem criteria, it is not expected that sub-criteria are assessed independently of the main criterion.

## E1 Impact on Endangered, Threatened or Protected species (ETP species)

- E1.1 Information on interactions between the fishery and ETP species is collected.

In reaching a determination for E1.1, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E1.1.1   ETP species which may be directly affected by the fishery have been identified.
- E1.1.2   Interactions between the fishery and ETP species are recorded and reported to management organisations.
- E1.1.3   Collection and analysis of ETP information is adequate to provide a reliable indication of the impact the fishery has on ETP species.
- E1.2 The fishery has no significant negative impact on ETP species.
- In reaching a determination for E1.2, the assessor should consider if the following is in place: The information collected in relation to E1.1.3 indicates that the fishery does not

E1.2.1 have a significant negative impact on ETP species .

- E1.3 There is an ETP management strategy in place for the fishery.

In reaching a determination for E1.3, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E1.3.1   There are measures applied to the fishery which are designed to manage the impacts of the fishery on ETP species.
- E1.3.2   The measures are considered likely to achieve the objectives of regional, national and international legislation relating to ETP species.

## E2 Impact on the habitat

- E2.1 Information on interactions between the fishery and marine habitats is collected.

In reaching a determination for E2.1, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E2.1.1   Habitats which may be directly affected by the fishery have been identified, including any habitats which may be particularly vulnerable.
- E2.1.2   Information on the scale, location and intensity of fishing activity relative to habitats is collected.
- E2.1.3   Collection and analysis of habitat information is adequate to provide a reliable indication of the impact the fishery has on marine habitats.
- E2.2 The fishery has no significant impact on marine habitats.

In reaching a determination for E2.2 the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

<!-- image -->

- E2.2.1 The information collected in relation to E2.1.3 indicates that the fishery does not have a significant negative impact on marine habitats.
- E2.3 There is a habitat management strategy in place for the fishery.

In reaching a determination for E2.3, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E2.3.1 There are measures applied to the fishery which are designed to manage the impact of the fishery on marine habitats.
- E2.3.2 The measures are considered likely to prevent the fishery from having a significant negative impact on marine habitats.

## E3 Impact on the ecosystem

- E3.1 Information on the potential impacts of the fishery on marine ecosystems is collected.

In reaching a determination for E3.1, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E3.1.1   The main elements of the marine ecosystems in the area(s) where the fishery takes place have been identified.
- E3.1.2   The role of the species caught in the fishery within the marine ecosystem is understood, either through research on this specific fishery or inferred from other fisheries.
- E3.1.3   Collection and analysis of ecosystem information is adequate to provide a reliable indication of the impact the fishery has on marine ecosystems.
- E3.2 There is no substantial evidence that the fishery has a significant negative impact on the marine ecosystem.

In reaching a determination for E3.2, the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E3.2.1   The information collected in relation to E3.1.3 indicates that the fishery does not have a significant negative impact on marine ecosystems.
- E3.3 There is an ecosystem management strategy in place for the fishery.

In reaching a determination for E3.3,. the assessor should consider if the following is in place:

- E3.3.1   There are measures applied to the fishery which are designed to manage the impacts of the fishery on marine ecosystems.
- E3.3.2   The measures are considered likely to prevent the fishery from having a significant negative impact on marine ecosystems.

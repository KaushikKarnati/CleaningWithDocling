## 1. Background

The  aim  of  this  document  is  to  provide  guidance  on  the  assessment  of  multi-species/multi-gear fisheries (referred to as multi-species fisheries in the rest of this document) for MarinTrust to assess whether  the  marine  ingredients  used  for  aquafeed  and  land  animal  feed,  as  well  as  for  human consumption,  are  responsibly  sourced  and  produced  from  these  fisheries.  This  multi-species assessment is part of a multi-species pilot, the aim of which is to develop a credible and recognised assessment framework to evaluate multi-species fisheries. The assessment will be considered as one of the requirements for acceptance onto the MarinTrust Improver Programme (IP) and will, over time, work towards full MarinTrust approval.

To date, the MarinTrust assessments have been  based  on  single-species assessments  and management approaches 1 2  that assessed (i) management frameworks, (ii) catch, (iii) endangered, threatened and protected species (ETPs), (iv) habitats and (v) ecosystem impacts. The assessment of catch is  based  on  the  dichotomy  of  'target'  and  'bycatch  species' and  constructed  around  single species  concepts,  such  as  maintaining  all  species  at  the  maximum  sustainable  yield  (MSY)  and assessing single stock biomass/fishing mortality reference points.

However, the vast majority of fisheries in the world are not single-species fisheries that capture just one  or  two  species -they  are  multi-species  in  nature.  These  range  from  fisheries  that  target  a relatively small number of species with a single gear to fisheries that catch hundreds of species using a  number  of  different  gear  types.  By  adapting  the  existing  MarinTrust  criteria  to  multi-species fisheries, especially tropical multi-species fisheries in developing countries, some important attributes of multi-species fisheries need to be recognised. These include:

- · The number of species caught, and the range of gears used is usually large. This often means that there are too many species and gear interactions for a traditional stock assessment approach. Multi-species  fisheries  need  different  assessment  approaches  (e.g.  ecosystem  modelling, aggregate modelling, indicator species and indicators).
- · The fishery resource cannot be divided neatly into target and non-target groups.
- · It is not possible, and probably not desirable, to manage all species at MSY.
- · There is often full utilisation of everything that is caught. A lot of so-called low value/trash fish are utilised as a marine ingredient, rather than being discarded.
- · Multi-species  can  be  more  resilient  to  fishing  because  there  are  many  different  species  and markets available as ecosystem structure and function change.
- · The issues regarding impacts on habitats and ETPs are the same as for single species fisheries and do not require different treatment, although, because of the increased number of fishing gears, interactions are more likely.
- · Governance is more difficult in multi-species fisheries, especially in developing countries. Lack of good governance is often the main cause of management failure.

## 2. Approach

The assessment builds on the existing MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients Fishery Assessment Methodology. As with the MarinTrust single-species assessment, the multi-species assessment begins with the assumption that an unmanaged but fully developed fishery would represent a very high risk to the following four categories:

- · The species caught in the fishery (the catch) [Section 2: A, B and C]
- · ETP species with which the fishery interacts [Section 2: T]
- · The critical habitats within which the fishery occurs [Section 2: H]
- · The ecosystems within which the fishery occurs [Section 2: E]

Towards mitigating the risk, in the multi-species assessment there is an overarching set of criteria that assesses the:

- · Management/governance frameworks [Section 1: M1, M2 and M3]

For the catch, the assessment covers:

- · Setting of management objectives and reference points
- · Monitoring of key indicators through regular data collection and analysis
- · Regular assessment of the status of the fishery resources
- · Application of effective management measures
- · Regular evaluation and reporting of management performance

For the ETPS, habitats and ecosystem impacts, the assessment covers:

- · Identification of ETPS and critical habitats
- · Consideration of the potential impacts on ETPs, critical habitats and the ecosystem
- · Information on impacts
- · Application of effective management measures, where appropriate

The Fishery  Risk  Rating  sections  of  the  multi-species  assessment  seek  to  characterise  the  current status of the fishery and guide future development; there is no requirement for a unit of assessment (UoA) to meet a particular minimum score against any individual Fishery Risk Rating question or any Fishery Risk Rating section.

The assessment criteria assume that the UoA is not managed as a straddling stock or across state jurisdictions. If this is not the case, extra criteria will need to be developed.

## 3. International norms and guidance

The  multi-species  assessment  is  based  on  best-practice  fisheries  management  as  specified  in international norms and guidance including:

- · The 1982 Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
- · The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
- · The 1995 Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)  (and its associated Technical Guidelines) 3

- · The 2006 regionalisation of the code for Southeast Asia (Southeast Asia Regional CCRF) ; and 4 a dditional guidance, especially relating to stocks within 'safe biological limits' , obtained from the 1995 UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Stocks 5

The FAO CCRF is a voluntary code that sets out principles and international standards of behaviour for responsible  practices  with  a  view  to  ensuring  the  effective  conservation,  management  and development of living aquatic resources, with due respect for the ecosystem and biodiversity. The Southeast Asia Regional CCRF was developed to expand the principles to cover multi-species fisheries in the ASEAN region. It is important to note that, as requested by the FAO Governing Bodies, the CCRF was formulated in such a way as to be consistent with the 1982 UNCLOS so that, by default, UNCLOS standards apply.

The  following  criteria  are  designed  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  the  key  goals  of  fisheries management are being achieved in the UoA based on the principles of the FAO CCRF. Comparisons of the multi-species criteria with the MarinTrust V2.2 whole fish fishery assessment, the FAO CCRF, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Standard, Version 2.01, August 2018 and the Global Sustainability Seafood Initiative (GSSI) Global Benchmark Tool, Version 1, October 2015 are included in Annex 1.

## 4. Management framework and management cycle

The management/governance framework (see figure below) can be described in three layers. The outer layer includes influences outside of the UoA: (i) international law and norms, (ii) the principles of the ecosystem approach and stakeholder participation (co-management), and (iii) national fisheries and environmental legislation that empowers management. The second layer involves the (i) national policy goals, and the influences on the UoA itself, including (i) the management planning process, (ii) governance  arrangements,  (iii)  data  and  information  that  informs  decision  making,  (iv)  rules  and regulations  (both  formal  and  informal)  and  (v)  compliance  and  enforcement  of  the  laws  and regulations. The inner layer is the management cycle/harvest strategy that affects the catch, ETPs, habitats and ecosystem (see below). Section 1 of this multi-species assessment covers the two outer layers, while section 2 is based on the management cycle/harvest strategy.

## Management framework

<!-- image -->

The management cycle, which guides the assessment and management of catch, ETPs, habitats and ecosystem  (section  2),  links  the  high-level  policy  goal(s)  with  the  management  measures  used  to achieve the goal(s) (as shown in the figure below adapted from FAO (2003)6):

## Management cycle/harvest strategy

<!-- image -->

6 FAO 2003. Fisheries management: The ecosystem approach to fisheries. FAO Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries , No. 4, Suppl. 2., 112pp. http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4470e.pdf

Note: When considering catch, the term 'harvest strategy' and 'harvest control rules' are commonly used,  especially  for  single-species  assessment  and  management.  The  harvest  strategy  includes the combination of setting operational objective(s), indicators and reference points, the assessment of the status of the fishery resource, the setting management measures and harvest control rules, and the monitoring and evaluation of management performance (i.e. steps 3, 4 and 6 in the diagram plus data analysis  relating  the  fishery  resource  assessment).  However,  when  considering  ETPs,  habitats  and ecosystem impacts under EAFM, the generic terms 'management strategy' and 'decision rules' are more appropriate.

The management cycle starts with the policy goals for management (ecological, economic and/or social) that help form an overall vision of what the fishery will look like in the future. The next step is to identify and prioritise the issues and threats that may prevent reaching the policy goals. The core problems that underlie these issues are then translated as operational objectives, each with its own indicator(s)  and  reference  point(s).  Management  measures  that  can  address  the  causes  of  the problems are chosen and often framed as decision rules that specify actions if the reference points are reached or exceeded. The cycle is then completed by monitoring and evaluating progress towards achieving the objectives by comparing indicators with reference points (performance measures).

Depending  on  the  evaluation  results,  adaptive  management  is  then  applied  through  a  series  of feedback loops that can update and modify the appropriate step in the cycle and, in extreme cases, the overarching policy goals. Participation of key stakeholders is important in all steps of the cycle, as is input from data analyses and information.

## 5. Scoring system

The assessment is divided into two main sections:

Section 1: Management and governance

Section 2: Catch, ETPs, habitats and ecosystems

Section 1 is treated differently to Section 2 and is rated simply as a  Pass  or  Gap . If assessed as a gap, ' ' ' ' actions to reduce the gap need to be included in a Fishery Action Plan (FAP).

In Section 2, fisheries are assumed by default to represent a very high risk in the four areas: catch, ETPs, habitats and ecosystems. Actions taken by fishery managers or other fishery stakeholders can mitigate these risks to a greater or lesser extent.

The level of risk posed by a fishery in each of the four categories (catch, ETPs, habitats and ecosystem) is measured on a scale of 0-100 and is termed the Fishery Risk Rating. For each category, the default before any risk mitigation is taken into account is 100 for any one category, which is considered very high risk. The sum of the mitigation scores for each category is then deducted from 100, to derive a Risk Rating. The sum of the mitigation scores is designed so that a maximum mitigation score is 100 (or close to it) for the category (resulting in a risk rating score of 0). For example, if there are four criteria, the maximum mitigation score for each criterion is 25. If there are six criteria, the maximum mitigation score is 11.

This results in the following current Fishery Risk Rating categories:

| Very Low   | Low   | Moderate   | High   | Very High   |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|-------------|
| 0-20       | 20-40 | 40-60      | 60-80  | 80-100      |

There is no minimum risk rating that an applicant fishery must achieve. However, to remain in the MarinTrust Improver Program (IP) a fishery must be able to demonstrate a reduction in risk rating over time. At this stage of the IP pilot we are allowing fisheries to propose their own improvement timeline, which  we  will  ask  expert  peer  reviewers  to  examine  and  to  determine  whether  it  represents  a meaningful rate of progress. These requirements will tighten as the learnings from the pilot IP are assessed.  Once  the  assessment  is  finalized  and  there  is  a  determination  on  where  responsible management of fisheries falls under the standard process, a decision on the timeline will then be made

The mitigation value for each criterion can be used by a fishery to reduce the level of risk for any of the risk areas. This risk assessment process will allow the fishery to identify the main risks to the fishery and allow for the development of a FAP that could include strategies and measures that will further reduce the Fishery Risk Ratings over time.

The MarinTrust Improver Programme aims to allow fisheries the flexibility to reduce the risk they pose through whatever actions they deem appropriate for their specific circumstances. Therefore, potential mitigation measures are not limited to those listed in the IP multi-species assessment methodology.

## 6. Characteristics of the fishery

The  UoA  needs  an  introductory  overview  (3-4  pages)  to  the  fishery  that  provides  context  to  the assessment. This should be completed by the assessor based on a checklist of input from the applicant and include referencing documents used (electronic or other):

- 1. Area of operation of the UoA and jurisdiction under which it falls
- 2. History of the fishery and its past management
- 3. Profiles of the catch taken and the type of fleets used in the fishery
- 4. Fishing areas and seasons
- 5. Gears and operation of the fishery
- 6. The supply chain for fishmeal/oil
- 7. Management objectives for the fishery (referring to any or all of the following if relevant):
- a. Resources
- b. Environmental
- c. Biodiversity and ecosystem
- d. Social
- e. Economic
- 8. Data availability
- 9. Current status of the fishery resources, ETPs, habitats and the ecosystem
- 10. Current management arrangements and measures, including details of those individuals or groups granted rights of access to the fishery and particulars of the nature of those rights
- 11. Arrangements  and  responsibilities  for  monitoring,  control  and  surveillance  (MCS)  and enforcement
- 12. Arrangements  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  management  performance,  including reporting requirements

The report shall have a summary of the assessment process based on the topics below, referencing documents used (electronic or other):

- · Particulars of the recognised groups with interests in the UoA

Page 7 of 48

- · Details of consultations leading to the formulation of the Fisheries Action Plan (FAP)
- · Arrangements for on-going consultations with interest groups
- · Details of the decision-making process or processes, including the recognised participants
- · Details of any planned education and training for interest groups

## 7. Section 1: Management/governance frameworks

The three criteria in this section relate to the overall management and governance regime applied to the fishery under assessment. The table below outlines the standards specified in the (i) UNCLOS, CBD, (ii) the FAO CCRF and (iii) the Southeast Asia Regional CCRF.

' |

These  norms  were  used  to  expand  the  MarinTrust  single-species  criteria  that  covered  the management framework and surveillance, control and enforcement. The new Section 1 criteria cover:

- · M1: Legislation, policy, and plans
- · M2: Institutions and stakeholder engagement
- · M3: Monitoring, control and surveillance

The criteria  should  be  completed  by  providing  sufficient  evidence  to  justify  awarding  each  of  the requirements a Pass or Gap rating. If any element is assessed as a gap, then an action to lessen the gap needs to be specified in the FAP.

Many of the terms used in these criteria (e.g. sustainable development) are defined in the glossary at the end of the guidelines.

## Guidance:

## M1.1 The fishery is covered by modern comprehensive legislation.

For a pass, the legislation must be based on modern fisheries management principles (developed in at least the last 10 years) and be revised regularly (every 5-10 years). The legislation needs to include primary  legislation  such  as  laws/acts  as  well  as  subsidiary  legislation  outlining  the  rules  and regulations that govern the fishery.

## M1.2 The fishery has legislation based on relevant international law, instruments and standards.

The law/act must include references to international obligations and international law, such as the ecosystem approach to fisheries, the precautionary principle, adaptive management  and transparency and participation.

## M1.3 The legislation and overarching policies outline the overall policy goals for the fishery.

There needs to be sufficient evidence that fishery management is guided by the broad policy goals as set out in either/both legislation and overarching policies e.g. enhance food security, achieve the maximum economic yield or maximize employment.

## M1.4 The legislation legally empowers the fishery management organisation(s) to manage the fishery.

The legislation should legally empower a fishery management organisation(s) to be responsible for planning and administering the fishery, undertaking monitoring control and surveillance activities and implementing management measures.

## M1.5 The policies and plans publicly commit to sustainable development (sustainability).

Evidence  from  policy documents/plans  that  show  commitment  to  sustainability,  including references.

## M1.6 The legislation and national policies include arrangements for stakeholder engagement and consultation.

Fisheries  legislation  and  policy  documents  should  state  requirements  for  consultation  with stakeholders or the need to have stakeholders involved in the management advisory process.

## M1.7 The fishery has an up-to-date fisheries management plan.

Ideally, the UoA should have its own fisheries management plan that is based on international best practice  and  recognises  international  norms  and  standards.  However,  the  fishery  could  also  be under  the  umbrella  of  a  broader  fisheries  management  plan  that  refers  to  the  UoA  under consideration.

## M1.8 The fishery management plan specifies goals and operational objectives.

The fishery management plan needs to have clearly stated goals and objectives so that it is clear what is trying to be achieved by harvesting the fishery resource.

## M1.9 The fishery management plan outlines the roles and responsibilities of the different fishery management and partner organisations.

The plan needs to specify who is responsible for implementing the management measures and for assessing their success or otherwise. This should include other agencies responsible for conservation and protection, such as the environmental agency.

## Guidance:

M2.1 The organisation identified in the initial screening has an effective management framework in place.

For  a  pass  rating,  there  needs  to  be  clear,  publicly  available  evidence  that  identifies  the  key organisations involved in the management and administration of the fishery that cover, at least, the following areas of responsibility:

- · Policy and planning
- · Data collection and analyses
- · Registration and licensing of vessels/gears
- · Decision-making (both long-term policy and day-to-day)
- · Monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS)
- · Administration and training

A quick check is to examine the organisation's structure to see whether these components of the management framework are covered.

Where  there  is  sufficient  information  available  publicly  to  conduct  the  MarinTrust  assessment without resorting to requests for additional information, assessors should consider this evidence that the management process is adequately transparent for the purposes of this clause.

## M2.2 The management decision-making is based on the best scientific evidence available.

Identify  organisation  responsible  for  collecting  data  and  assessing  the  status  of  fishery  and,  in particular,  the  status of  the  fishery  resources.  Is  the  organisation  providing  management advice based on the best scientific evidence?

Also, does the organisation include fishers/fishing communities to provide additional information to managers to support the effective management of the fishery? This could include information on the fishery resource, fishing operations and providing operational or economic data.

## M2.3 There is an organisation charged with the identification, management and conservation of ETPs with jurisdiction over the fishery.

The fishery should have an organisation that is responsible for identifying ETP species and providing plans and strategies to conserve and protect ETPs that, is part of, or works cooperatively with the fisheries management organisation.

## M2.4 There is an organisation responsible for the conservation and protection of fishery habitats.

The fishery  should  also  have  an  organisation  that  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  fishery habitats. If it is an organisation that is not the fishery management organisation, there should be cooperation and coordination mechanisms in place.

M2.5  The  fishery  has  some  form  of  governance  arrangements  in  place  that  can  be  used  to coordinate management between the government organisation and key stakeholders.

Assessors  should  ensure  that  the  management  system  includes  governance  arrangements  that facilitate  the  engagement  and  involvement  of  relevant  stakeholders,  such  as  fishing  industry representatives, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and environmental NGOs. Are there any committees in place to facilitate coordination across stakeholders and jurisdictions?

## M2.6 There is a consultation process through which fishery stakeholders are engaged in decisionmaking.

What mechanisms  are  in  place  to  engage  stakeholders?  Does  the  management  system  include consultation processes? Are there recent relevant examples of these?

M2.7 The decision-making process is transparent, with processes and results publicly available.

Is  there  formal  communication  with  fishery  stakeholders  explaining  reasons  for  management measures? This could be via stakeholder meetings, direct mailing, websites etc.

## Evidence

- · Fisheries legislation
- · Fishery management plans
- · Government websites
- · Government organisation annual reports

Any agency reports, such as fishery meetings, annual reports and stakeholder committee minutes that may detail evidence of consultation and engagement of stakeholders.

## Guidance:

M3.1 The MCs organisation identified in the initial screening provides effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms that ensure management measures are complied with.

Are MCS mechanisms in place to ensure the management measures in the fishery are enforced and complied with. This involves having effective risk-based MCS plans, and implementation of relevant strategies to minimise the risk of IUU, including informal mechanisms?

M3.2 There are adequate sanctions for illegal activities.

Sanctions  that  can  be  applied  when  rules  and  regulations  are  broken  need  to  be  part  of  the legislation/regulations. The sanctions also need to be of a sufficient scale to be a real deterrent. Do legislation/regulations clearly state the sanctions for different infringements?

The  assessment  team  will  ensure  that,  where  fishing  regulations  are  broken,  sanctions  of appropriately  effective  scale  are  invoked  by  the  State  or  States  controlling  the  fishery.  The assessment team will list examples of the key laws and summarise the sanctions deemed to be a violation, and where possible, provide cases where the punishment on offending vessels has been executed.

M3.3  There  is  no  substantial  evidence  of  widespread  non-compliance  in  the  fishery,  and  no substantial evidence of IUU fishing.

Can it be determined that fishers comply with all relevant regulations?

The assessment team will determine the extent to which the management measures are effective, looking in particular for any reports illustrating examples of infringements. Additional evidence for this  section  can  be  obtained  by  on-site  assessors,  for  example  ensuring  that  all  landings  are monitored or that vessel locations are recorded.

M3.4 Compliance with laws and regulations is actively monitored, through a regime which may include at-sea and portside inspections, observer programmes and VMS.

The assessment team will determine the effectiveness of the organisation responsible for fishery control  and  enforcement,  and  the  actions  taken  by  that  organisation.  These  will  include consideration of activities that are appropriate for the fishery, for example:

- a) Dockside monitoring
- b) Boarding vessels
- c) On-board observers
- d) Electronic technologies such as mobile apps, cameras, etc.
- e) Vessel monitoring system (VMS) or GPS vessel monitoring
- f) Vessel licensing
- g) Aerial enforcement

M3.5 Stakeholders in the fishery are aware of, and understand, the laws and regulations.

Do stakeholders know about the laws and regulations that govern them? Are there any awareness programs, literature, signage etc that inform the stakeholders about the laws and regulations?

## Evidence

- · Fisheries legislation
- · Records of court cases
- · MCS plans and strategies
- · MCS mechanisms in place such as VMS, vessel inspections (both at sea and on landing), logbook, sales notes and landing declarations, landing restrictions etc.
- · Regional MCS reports -including reviews/ evaluations of MCS efficacy
- · Fishery management plans

## 8. Section 2: Catch, endangered, threatened and protected species (ETPs), habitats and ecosystem impacts

This section is broken up into:

## · 2a: Catch

- o A: Total aggregate catch
- o B: High-risk/vulnerable species/species groups
- o C: Reduction component of the catch
- · 2b: Endangered, threatened and protected species (ETPS)
- · 2c: Habitats
- · 2d: Ecosystem impacts

It is important not to lose sight of the interactions among these categories. For example, impacts on the total aggregated catch will also impact on the ETPs, habitats and the ecosystem structure and function.

## 8.1 2a. Catch

Catch is defined as the landed catch, along with any quantity of discards. The focus on catch is not intended to ignore other requirements for maximising socio-economic benefits, nor other measures to control fisheries, such as effort controls -but the indicator and reference point of interest is the catch.  For  example,  management  objectives  could  be  to  control  fishing  effort  through  control  on vessels or gears, which would have their own indicators and reference points, but these objectives would be evaluated through their impact on catch.

As stated in UNCLOS and the CCRF, fisheries management is aimed at maximising socio-economic benefits while maintaining or restoring populations of harvested species at levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors. All species, including associated or dependent species, should be maintained above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened (also known as the point at which recruitment is impaired (PRI)).

Based on these principles, the catch of the multi-species fishery is divided into three parts:

Part A: Total aggregate catch (using a target reference point (TRP -see glossary for definition) e.g. the multi-species maximum sustainable yield (MMSY)). It is up to the UoA to nominate the TRP that meets the overall fisheries management policy goal, with a default being the MMSY.

Part B: High-risk species/species groups (using a limit reference point (LRP) e.g. the PRI (see glossary for  definition).  Note:  These  species  or  groups  of  species  do  not  include  ETPs  that  are  assessed separately below. It is up to the UoA to nominate the LRP that meets the overall fisheries management policy goal, with a default being a PRI of 20%.

Part C: The component of the catch that is used to manufacture fish meal/oil based on demonstrating sustainability of the catch and minimum impact on juveniles of high-value species. In tropical fisheries this component is often known as  low value/trash fish . ' '

## 8.1.1 Part A: Total aggregate catch

The following table is a summary of relevant overarching standards that relate to the total aggregate catch of the fishery.

The standard requires the existence of management objectives that are applicable to the UoA and the  fishery  resources  under  consideration  and  seek  outcomes  consistent  with  the  long-term

sustainable  use  of  the  fisheries  resources  under  management.  The  objectives  may  be  formally described or, in some cases such as small data-poor fisheries, informally accepted and understood.

The objectives  could  apply  to  a  group  of  species  or  the  aggregate  of  all  species  as  long  as  the aggregate catch is controlled to levels consistent with the target reference point.

The term  species/species groups  refers to individual species or a group of similar species and is ' ' intended to allow the fishery the flexibility to manage the resource in a way which is appropriate for its particular circumstances.  The  fishery  should  be  able  to  justify  the  particular  grouping methodology for the species groups it has selected, within the broader context of the management approach implemented. This remains true throughout the remainder of the criteria that use this term.

Target reference point. The target reference point for the aggregate catch is set by the governing body. It could be the MMSY -the annual catch which on average can be removed yearly from the fishery resources without deteriorating the productivity of the resources is the baseline standard. This is reflected in the target biomass (BMMSY) and target fishing mortality (FMMSY) that can support the maximum sustainable yield. Depending on the policy goals for the fishery, other target reference points are possible but these need to be more conservative than the MMSY standard e.g. multispecies maximum economic yield (MMEY) or MSY levels to rebuild ecosystem structure and function that requires a lower level of fishing effort to achieve.

Fishing at levels to produce the MMSY does not imply that all species/species groups will be fished at MSY. Catches of some will be above their MSY, while others will be below their MSY. For the species/species groups above their MSY, it important to consider these as high-risk species/species groups (see Part B) that need management measures to keep these above their PRI. Note: As a result of the biological and technological interactions between species, the sum of independent species MSY for a fished ecosystem is consistently much larger than the aggregate MMSY and if independent species MSY form the basis for catch limits they will likely lead to overfishing.

In data-poor fisheries where an estimate of the MMSY is not possible, proxies can be used as long as the constraints of the proxies are acknowledged and corrected to the extent possible. The GSSI defines a proxy as a surrogate or substitute approach that results in acceptable outcomes consistent with the primary approach. When data are insufficient to estimate reference points directly other measures of productive capacity can serve as reasonable substitutes or  proxies . Suitable proxies ' ' may be, for example, standardised CPUE as a proxy for biomass, standardised fishing effort as a substitute for fishing mortality. Alternatively, specific levels of fishing mortality and biomass which have proven useful in other fisheries and may be used with a high degree of confidence in the absence  of  better-defined  levels.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  use  of  a  proxy  may  involve additional uncertainty, and if so, should trigger the use of extra precaution in the setting of the target reference points.

## Guidance

This criterion has two components: firstly, data and information that allow regular assessments of the fishery resources status (see A3), and secondly, indicators as part of management cycle/harvest strategy that can be used to assess how well the target reference point is being achieved (see A6).

In  the first component, the data and information must be sufficient to allow assessment of the fishery resource status based on the assessment methodology of choice (e.g. formal assessment methods or more data-poor methods.

In the second component along with estimates of total catch (total landings and discards, other indicators such as aggregate biomass (B) and aggregate fishing mortality (F) should be monitored, as  appropriate,  to  assess  how  well  management  objectives  are  being  achieved.  In  data-poor situations, proxies for these could include the standardised catch rate (CPUE) standardised fishing effort (f) etc. The degree of disaggregation required will be dependent on the mechanism used by the fishery to calculate total removals e.g. the categorisation used for  species/species groups . Is ' ' the fishery collecting catch composition data consistent with the species/species groups that are appropriate? Where harvest control rules (HCR) have been specified, data and information on the relevant indicator(s) should be collected and assessed regularly, so that the HCR can be effectively implemented.

Ideally, a number of indicators should be used, which are not all highly correlated. The fishery may use any scientifically justifiable methodology to determine the appropriate level of monitoring for certainty/frequency. The assessor should consider the relative reliability of the methodology used and the potential for intentional or unintentional errors in records. Where harvest control rules (HCR) have been specified, data and information on the relevant indicator(s) should be collected and assessed regularly, so that the HCR can be effectively implemented.

The status of the fishery resource is based on indirect evidence from indicators or proxies of stock status.

The fishery resource status has been recently assessed using a scientifically sound methodology.

Mitigation

Score

17

## Guidance

The assessment of the status of the fishery resource should be based on the best scientific advice available. To score a high mitigation score this would need to involve a formal assessment based on tools  such  as  aggregate  production  modelling,  multi-species  production  modelling,  ecosystem modelling etc. This would include estimates of the current biomass in relation to the BMMSY and the fishing mortality in relation to FMMSY.

Where such quantitative assessments are not available, either through a lack of informative data or the capacity to analyse them, or both, less data-rich assessments of the status of the aggregate resource are possible. For example, analyses of the historical catch time-series and distributions of various population parameters, swept-area methods based on ad-hoc fishery-independent surveys and non-parametric analyses. These methods would rate a lower risk mitigation score.

This criterion requires that the status of the resource has been recently assessed and compared with a target reference point. To score 17, the both the current status and the target reference point need to be known with a high level of certainty that has involved the estimation of the target reference point using the best available scientific evidence.

Are there management measures in place to control the amount of the total catch and are they being complied with and effective? Management measures could include:

- · Catch controls (total allowable catch (TACs), catch quotas)
- · Effort controls (total allowable effort (TAEs), effort quotas)
- o Boat number limits, fishing days limits, gear restrictions, TURFs
- · Vessel buybacks
- · Gear  modifications  (mesh  size,  bycatch  reduction  devices  (BRDs),  juvenile  and  trash exclusion devices (JTEDs)
- · Limits of fish size (maximum and minimum)
- · Spatial controls (closed areas/zones, marine protected areas (MPAs)
- · Temporal controls (seasonal closures)
- · Restocking and stock enhancement
- · Artificial reefs

Effectiveness could be assessed against whether the right measures have been adopted and/or whether they are being complied with.

Guidance

Is there evidence that management is working towards meeting the objective(s)?

This question should be answered by having documented reports that directly compare objectives and target reference points described in A1 with the results of the monitoring of indicators in A2. The overall objective is to ensure that the fishery is achieving outcomes consistent with the longterm sustainable use of the fisheries resources under management. The objectives, however, may be more specific, such as to reduce the fishing effort and/or rebuild the resources, and in such cases the M&amp;E might involve comparing indicators such as the current fishing mortality with the FMMSY and the current biomass with BMMSY and their proxies.

## 8.1.2 Part B: High-risk species/species groups

High-risk species/species groups are defined as those that by nature of their biology and ecology are more vulnerable to fishing and more likely to be fished towards or past PRI. Note that the IUCN uses the term  vulnerable species  to refer to a species threatened with extinction unless the circumstances ' ' that are threatening its survival and reproduction improve. In the following criteria, we are referring to high-risk species/species groups that are not included as endangered, threatened and protected species (ETPs) in 2b. below). The following table is a summary of relevant overarching standards that relate to the high-risk species/species groups.

## UNCLOS, CBD

## FAO CCRF

## Southeast Asia Regional CCRF

CCRF Article 6.2:

'Management measures should not only ensure the conservation of target species but also of species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target species'.

well as how likely other species are to interact with fishing gear and is useful in identifying high-risk species/species groups. If there are a large number of high-risk species/species groups identified, a sample of indicator species/species groups could be chosen, as long as the choice is transparent and the indicator species/species group can be considered to be a representative sample of the whole high-risk category.

Limit  reference  point. The  limit  reference  point  indicates  the  limit  beyond  which  the  state  of  a fishery and/or resource is not considered desirable. For high-risk species/species groups the limit is the PRI. Fishery development should be stopped before reaching it but if a limit reference point is inadvertently reached, management action should severely curtail or stop fishery development, as appropriate, and corrective action should be taken.

The standard requires the existence of management objectives for high-risk species/species groups that are applicable to the UoA under consideration. These objectives may not be part of the normal fisheries  planning  and  implementation  management  cycle,  but  in  separate  documents  referring vulnerable species, e.g. National Plan of Action -Sharks.

Does the fishery collect data and information on the species/species groups identified as high risk? Is  the  fishery  collecting  catch  composition  data  consistent  with  the  appropriate  species/species groups? Is the fishery collecting other information relating to the species/species groups in the catch, including information that could be used  in carrying out stock assessments  (e.g. species/species group catch and effort data or length frequency data)? Note that a set of indicator species/species group can be used if it represents an adequate sample.

The  fishery  may  use  any  of  the  available  methods  to  determine  the  status  of  high-risk species/species  groups.  In  data-rich  fisheries  these  may  include  accepted  stock  assessment methods  such  as  production  modelling  or  age-based/  length-based  analyses.  Where  such quantitative assessment is not available, either through a lack of informative data or the capacity to analyse them, or both, data-poor assessments methods may be more appropriate but would have a lower risk mitigation score (see A3).

The fishery status with high-risk species/species groups with respect to the limit reference point is known with a high level of certainty.

17

## Guidance

This criterion requires that the status of the high-risk species/species groups has been recently assessed and compared with the limit reference point. To score 17, the both the current status and the limit reference point need to be known with a high level of certainty that has involved the estimation of the limit reference point using the best available scientific evidence.

## 8.1.3 Part C: Reduction component of the catch

The reduction component of the catch is defined as that part of the total catch that is destined to be reduced to fish meal and fish oil. This often consists of (i) by-products (bones, scraps and offal from fish  processing,  (ii)  low-value  small ' trash   fish  (fish  not  suitable  for  human  consumption), (iii)  low ' quality high-value fish (deteriorated to a state unfit for human consumption) and (iv) juveniles of higher-value fish.

The standards are a combination of the UNCLOS/FAO CCRF and the Southeast regional CCRF given in Parts A and B above. The total aggregate catch should be maintained below a target reference point (e.g.  MMSY  for  the  different  types  of  reduction  catch)  and  any  high-risk  species/species  groups maintained above a limit reference point (PRI) and the impact of catching juvenile fish of higher-value species minimized. What is considered to be an acceptable level of juvenile catch in the reduction component is at the discretion of the  UoA,  but  as with other criteria,  it  is  important  that  repeat assessments demonstrate improvement.

Different approaches may be needed for the four different types of the reduction component of the catch. For example, use of aggregate production model to give MMSY for the by-product group, the low-value  trash  fish and the low-quality higher-value fish and use these as an overall TRP for group. ' ' For individual indicator species use of the PRI and TRP of the depletion level predicted to give MMSY for the group could be used. A similar approach could be taken for effort controls, especially if there are many gears involved, each exerting a different fishing mortality, and there was a desire to change the gear mix of the catch. Evaluating the impact on juveniles of higher-value fish will be difficult for all the  species  involved  and,  in  the  timeframe  of  a  FIP,  a  simple  indicator  of  the  percentage  of  the reduction component that is juvenile fish of higher-value fish could be used.

The standard requires the existence of management objectives that are applicable to the reduction component of the catch of the UoA under consideration and seek outcomes consistent with the long-term sustainable use of this component of the fishery under management. The logic behind this criterion is that the  low-value/trash fish  is composed of highly productive forage fish that as ' ' a separate group will have a relatively high MMSY compared to the total fishery aggregate MMSY. By-products will be variable, but if sourced from a surimi factory again will consist of relatively high productivity species. In cases where large quantities of low-quality fish are used, these could pose a risk and would be covered in specific objectives for the reduction component.

## Guidance

The reduction component of the catch often contains large quantities of juvenile commercial fish. This can result in growth overfishing where the fishing mortality (or fishing pattern) is such that fish are caught before they have a chance to reach their growth potential and value. It can also contribute to recruitment overfishing where catching juvenile fish before they mature can lower the spawning biomass.

There may be hundreds of species where the juveniles of higher-value fish are part of the reduction component of the catch. Good practice fisheries management will have in place objective(s) that aim  to  reduce  the  catch  of  juvenile  fish  that  reduces ' growth  overfishing   and  potentially ' ' recruitment  overfishing .  This  could  be  an  aggregate  objective  relating  to  the  percentage  of ' juvenile high-value species in the reduction component, or if feasible, all or an indicator species subset of the more commonly caught species/species groups.

## Guidance

This criterion has two components: firstly, data and information that allow an assessment of the reduction component of the fishery resources status (see C4), and secondly, indicators as part of management cycle/harvest strategy that can be used to assess how well the target reference point is being achieved.

In the first component, the data and information must be sufficient to allow assessment of the status of the reduction component of the catch based on the assessment methodology of choice (e.g. formal assessment methods or more data-poor methods) for the different types of fish in the reduction component.

In the second component along with estimates of total reduction component catch (total landings and discards, other indicators such as aggregate biomass (B) and aggregate fishing mortality (F) should  be  monitored,  as  appropriate,  to  assess  how  well  management  objectives  are  being achieved.  In  data-poor  situations,  proxies  for  these  could  include  the  standardised  catch  rate (CPUE) standardised fishing effort (f) etc.

Is the fishery collecting data on the catch of  low-value/trash fish  and the low-quality higher value ' ' fish and catch composition data consistent with the species/species groups that are appropriate? Is there also data on fishing effort or other information needed to carry out an assessment of the status of the resource. Is there any data on the species composition that constitutes the by-product destined for reduction?

| There is no recent or reliable assessment of the status of the fish resources in the  reduction component of the catch.                  |                   0 |
| The status of the fishery resource in the reduction component is based on indirect  evidence from indicators or proxies of stock status. |                   6 |
| The fishery resource status has been recently assessed using a scientifically sound  methodology.                                        |                  11 |

The assessment of the status of the fishery resource in the reduction component of the catch should be based on the best scientific advice available. To score a high mitigation score this would need to involve a formal assessment based on tools such as aggregate production modelling, multispecies production modelling, ecosystem modelling etc. It could also entail PSA for the main  low-' value/trash  fish   stocks  to  demonstrate  that  these  are  stocks  have  a  low  vulnerability/risk  to ' current fishing effort.

Where such quantitative assessments are not available, either through a lack of informative data or the capacity to analyse them, or both, less data-rich assessments of the status of the aggregate resource are possible. For example, analyses of the historical catch time-series and distributions of various  population  parameters,  swept-area  methods  based  on  ad-hoc  fishery-independent surveys and non-parametric analyses. These methods would rate a lower risk mitigation score.

## Guidance

Are there management measures in place to control the amount of the total catch in the reduction component  and  are  they  being  complied  with  and  effective.  In  general,  these  would  refer  to management measures for the whole UoA that would also control the catch of the reduction component. These could include:

- · Catch controls (total allowable catch (TACs), catch quotas)
- · Effort controls (total allowable effort (TAEs), effort quotas)
- o Boat number limits, fishing days limits, gear restrictions, TURFs
- · Vessel buybacks
- · Limits of fish size (maximum and minimum)
- · Spatial controls (closed areas, MPAs)
- · Temporal controls (seasonal closures)
- · Restocking and stock enhancement
- · Artificial reefs

Are there also measures in place to further minimize the catch of juvenile commercial fish? These could include:

- · Gear modifications (mesh size limits, BRDs, JTEDs)
- · Temporal controls (seasonal closures to protect juvenile fish)

Note that it will be impossible to eliminate the catch of juvenile fish entirely without reducing the catch of the reduction component to such a level as to make it commercially unviable.

Is there evidence that management is working towards meeting the objective(s)?

This question should be answered by having documented reports that directly compare objectives and target reference points described in C1 with the results of the monitoring of indicators in C3. The overall objective is to ensure that the fishery is achieving outcomes consistent with the longterm sustainable use of the reduction component of fisheries resources under management. The objectives, however, may be more specific, such as to reduce the fishing effort and/or rebuild the resources, and in such cases the M&amp;E might involve comparing indicators such as the current fishing mortality with the FMMSY and the current biomass with BMMSY and their proxies.

## 8.2 2b. Endangered, threatened and protected species (ETPs)

This refers to species that are:

- · Categorised by the IUCN as Endangered or Critically Endangered:
- o Endangered. When used in the context of the IUCN Red List, a taxon is classified as endangered when there is very high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future.
- o Critically  Endangered.  When  used  in  the  context  of  the  IUCN  Red  List,  a  taxon  is classified as critically endangered when there is an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future (IUCN, 2001).

Or:

- · Appear in the CITES appendices I, II or III:
- o Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.
- o Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival.
- o Appendices III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.

Species  listed  in  national  (state/province/local)  legislation  as  being  depleted,  at  increased  risk  of extinction and usually subject to conservation measures are also considered as ETPs.

Possible ETPs include some species of turtles, dugongs, some species of seals, some species of sea snakes and 16 species of fish in Appendix I, 107 species in Appendix II and 24 species in Appendix III 24. The main groups of marine fish are (i) some species of sawfish, (ii) some species of sharks and (iii) some species of seahorses.

Note  no  species  in  CITES  appendices,  or  categorised  by  the  IUCN  as  Endangered  or  Critically Endangered, will be approved for use as a MarinTrust approved raw material.

For ETPs, the criteria are based on three main measures that consider whether:

- 1. interactions with ETPs are known;
- 2. there is no substantial evidence that the fishery has a significant negative effect on ETPs;
- 3. the fishery is known to interact with ETPs -if  so,  measures are in place to minimise mortality.

The following table is a summary of relevant overarching standards that relate to ETPs.

## Guidance

If there are no known interactions with any ETP, the mitigation score for this criterion is 33.

If there are known interactions, the assessor should take note of any regulations or management measures that are in place to avoid/minimise risks of capture, such as gear modifications e.g. turtle exclusion  devices  (TEDs),  bycatch  reduction  devices  (BRDs),  mesh  configurations  (e.g.  square meshes), closed areas and/or seasons of known ETP habitats.

Educational  material  and  training  for  fishermen  to  identify  ETP  species  and  learn  appropriate handling techniques that increase the survival of released ETPs is also an important measure.

Any studies that are on-going into protection of ETP species.

## 8.3 2c. Habitats

In a narrow sense a critical habitat is a habitat area essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species. In a broader definition, the Southeast Asia Regional CCRF defines critical habitats as habitats that are essential to maintaining the integrity of an ecosystem, species or assemblages of species. For a species, critical habitats are habitats that are important for the spawning and survival of juvenile fish, which if degraded, results in a decline in the abundance of fish. Mangroves, seagrass and coral reefs are commonly referred to as  critical habitats . ' '

Critical habitats are impacted by both fishery-related damage and damage caused by non-fishery uses such as coastal development, aquaculture, forestry and agriculture. The focus of this category is the degradation of critical habitats caused by fishing.

The assessment of critical habitats is also based on three main criteria:

- 1. Potential  critical  habitat  interactions  are  considered  in  the  management  decisionmaking process.
- 2. There is no substantial evidence that the fishery has a significant negative impact on critical habitats.
- 3. If the fishery is known to interact with critical habitats, there are measures in place to minimise and mitigate negative impacts to within acceptable limits.

The following table is a summary of relevant overarching standards that relate to habitats.

Measures  may  include  specification  of  the  critical  habitats  in  fisheries  management  plans  or  in separate critical habitat management plans. They may also include laws, rules and regulations aimed to conserve or protect certain critical habitats or traditional knowledge of fishers, such as protection by a spatial/temporal closure.

If there is little available information on the critical habitats encountered by the fishery, a risk-based approach could be used.

The level of knowledge of the critical habitats for the species/species groups under consideration and critical habitats that are highly vulnerable to damage by the fishing gear of the UoA should provide  sufficient  understanding  to  enable  impacts  of  the  UoA  on  those  critical  habitats  to  be avoided, minimised or mitigated.

The assessors should review the information that is available to understand the main impacts of the gear on the main critical habitats, especially spatial overlap of critical habitats and fishing gear.

GSSI: D.4.05 The standard requires that there is knowledge within the fishery management system of  the  essential  critical  habitats  for  the  stock  under  consideration  and  habitats  that  are  highly vulnerable to damage by the fishing gear of the UoA. This includes knowledge of the full spatial range  of  the  relevant  critical  habitat,  not  just  that  part  of  the  spatial  range  that  is  potentially affected by fishing.

## Guidance

The  standard  requires  the  existence  of  management  measures  seeking  to  avoid,  minimise  or mitigate  impacts  of  the  UoA  on  essential  critical  habitats  for  the  species/species  groups  under consideration and on critical habitats that are highly vulnerable to damage by the fishing gear of the UoA. For example, spatial/temporal closures, closed areas and/or seasons in critical habitats (e.g.  coral  reefs,  seagrass  beds,  mangrove  areas,  etc.)  gear  modifications,  and/or  banning  of destructive gears.

The assessor should review the regulations or management measures that are in place to protect critical habitats. The assessor should also establish whether the measures are being complied with.

## 8.4 2d. Ecosystems

Fishing, like any human activity, has an impact on the ecosystem. The production of food on land is almost entirely based on managed ecosystem change which is generally significant e.g. monoculture crops on cleared lands. For fisheries, there are choices and trade-offs to be made and good fisheries management makes clear the options and consequences of fishing. The complexity of ecosystems can make defining desirable operational reference points difficult. What should an ecosystem structure look like? How much change is allowable before undesirable effects occur? Selecting any particular ecosystem structure will come with trade-offs. It is impossible to have all species simultaneously at large biomasses because an increase in some species will mean a decline in others. The phenomenon of  fishing down the food chain  is possible. This is the depletion of the large predatory fish on top of ' ' the food web, which is followed by the depletion of increasingly smaller species, finally ending up with previously non-commercial  small  fish and invertebrates. An  ecosystem  where  predators  are depressed may generate larger standing biomasses and potential yields of prey species, but this will come at a cost of increased potential for year-to-year variation within the system and lower prices per weight.

In trying to select a plausible and desired ecosystem state and because of the nonlinear dynamics of ecosystems along with the influence of climate change, means that it may not be possible to get back to a previous state. The following table is a summary of relevant overarching standards that relate to the ecosystem.

The criteria for this category are:

- 1. The  impact  of  the  fishery  on  the  broader  ecosystem  within  which  the  fishery  occurs  is considered in management.
- 2. The impact on the ecosystem structure and function is known.
- 3. The presence of key ecological species (either key predators or key prey that influence the ecosystem structure and function) has been evaluated.
- 4. Management measures are in place to mitigate the impact of fishing on the ecosystem. If the impact on any key ecological elements is unacceptable, additional precaution is included in recommendations relating to the total permissible fishery removals.

As with many of the other categories considered in this multi-species assessment, there will be tradeoffs in terms of what is considered an acceptable outcome. In the case of the ecosystem, this will lie somewhere between having low fishing effort of selective fishing gears and a pristine ecosystem, to a high  fishing  effort  of  mainly  unselective  fishing  gears  that  have  had  a  deleterious  impact  on  the structure and function of the ecosystem. A primary goal should be to manage the system such that

the ecosystem structure is still resilient to future shocks, such as climate change, while still allowing other goals to be included, where agreed.

| The impact of the fishery on the broader ecosystem within which the fishery  occurs is considered fully in management.                | 25 |

The assessor should determine if the potential impact of the fishery on the ecosystem is recognised in the fishery management system. This could be in the form of legislation and/or policy. However, ' considered fully  would involve a description of how the ecosystem impact is operationalised in ' terms of fisheries management and considered in a fishery management plan or strategy document.

The impact could be assessed using one or more of the ecosystem-level indicators that relate the total catch to some indicator of ocean productivity. If feasible, the impact may be considered in the form of loss of biodiversity, both in the supporting environment and the supporting habitats. The ecosystem  structure  and  function  should  not  necessarily  be  undisturbed  (not  possible  when harvesting occurs) but should not be excessively risky.

Have the main impacts of the ecosystem structure and function been assumed from this existing information but not fully investigated? Compared to the state prior to fishing, what changes have occurred in the ecosystem structure that could impact its resilience to further impacts (e.g. changes in fishing operations or climate change.

## Guidance

This criterion looks at the case where there could be key ecological species in the ecosystem. These are defined as an organism that helps define an entire ecosystem. Without these keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether.

Examples of marine key ecological species include anchovy in some ecosystems that form the prey for a large number of marine species.

## Guidance

The assessor should review the regulations or management measures that are in place to manage the  impact  on  the  fishery  resources,  but  which  would  have  the  capacity  to  achieve  ecosystem outcomes. These would include all the measures aimed to control the fishing operations, but in particular areas closed to the fishery (e.g. marine protected areas (MPAS) set up to protect and conserve biodiversity). These need to meet the objectives as set out in E1.

If  the  impact  on  key  ecological  species  is  unacceptable,  it  may  be  necessary  to  add  additional precaution in the setting of, for example, catch and effort controls.

It may also be necessary to introduce additional controls to protect and conserve key ecological specie/species groups such as culling of undesirable species/species groups or restocking and stock enhancement.

The GSSI standard requires the existence of management objectives that seek to minimise adverse impacts of the UoA, including any associated enhancement activities if applicable, on the structure, processes  and  function  of  aquatic  ecosystems  that  are  likely  to  be  irreversible  or  very  slowly reversible.

The assessor should review the regulations or management measures that are in place to manage the impact on target species or other components, but which would have the capacity to achieve ecosystem outcomes.

## 9. Socio-economic criteria

In  addition  to  the  areas  examined  above,  applicants  to  full  MarinTrust  approval  must  commit  to ensuring that vessels operating in the fishery adhere to internationally recognised guidance on human rights. They must also commit to ensuring there is no use of enforced or unpaid labour in the fleet(s) operating upon the resource.

## Improver Programme notes

In  the  current  version  of  the  MarinTrust  fishery  assessment,  the  social  component  is  limited  to  a commitment from applicants. The extent to which this commitment is 'tested' is limited. However, applicants to the Improver Programme should be aware that this section will be under continuing development over the coming year(s), and additional social requirements are likely to be added before the end of any FIP process.

Because  the  overall  goal  of  fisheries  management  is  to  maximise  socio-economic  benefits  while minimising  impacts  on  the  fishery  resources  and  the  integrity,  structure  and  functioning  of  the ecosystem.  Because  of  this,  a  set  of  economic  criteria  is  also  being  considered  so  that  the  costs (impacts on the fishery resources and the ecosystem) can be balanced with socio-economic benefits.

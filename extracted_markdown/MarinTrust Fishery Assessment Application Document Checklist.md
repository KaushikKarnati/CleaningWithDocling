## MarinTrust Fishery Assessment Applicant document checklist

## 1. Introduction

## Using the Applicant Document Checklist

Review  the  information  provided  in  this  document,  and  then  complete  the  Applicant  Document Checklist  by  finding  as  much  information  related  to  your  fishery  as  possible  to  provide  to  the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) using the structured checklist. The more information that can be provided  to  the  CAB  at  an  early  stage  in  an  assessment  will  result  in  a  stronger,  more  robust assessment.

## Supporting Information

The MarinTrust Standard covers a variety of fisheries form all over the world, therefore it is impossible to create a list that will be applicable to everyone. It's also important to know what information is available and what isn't. If you look for documents and you can't find them, there is also space here for you to note that, so the assessment team is made aware.

## What is a fishery?

When the term 'the fishery' is used in this checklist, it can have several different definitions, for example it can refer simply to the specific Unit of Assessment (applicant fishery) but can also refer to a wider fisheries management system at a national or stock level. Usually, information comes from one or several of these levels interchangeably (e.g. a policy document with objectives could be an internal company policy or local, national, or international policy). However, with reference to stock levels, information about the entire stock is needed.

## The MarinTrust Standard

More detailed information about the requirements the fishery will be assessed against can be found here.  The  assessment  team  scores  the  fishery  against  the  Clauses  in  the  MarinTrust  Wholefish Standard. Some of the documents listed in the MarinTrust Applicant Document Checklist can be used for more than one Clause.

## 1. Fishery Catch Data

## What is it?

This is a record of what is caught by the fishery and the amount of fishing effort required to catch it (e.g. number of fishing trips taken per vessel, number of days per trip, distance covered, gear used [when and where], number of traps/hooks/lines, length of fishing net, etc.).

## What do assessment teams need to see?

Records of the following catch and fishing effort data:

- · Target species (species that will be assessed against the MSC Fisheries Standard);
- · Retained species (other than MSC-assessed species);
- · Discards/slipped catches; and,
- · Endangered, Threatened or Protected (ETP) species.

Please list all the species which regularly make up more than 0.1% of catch in the fishery by weight, and their estimated proportions in the catch.

Note that MarinTrust recognises that catch composition will vary over time. The data provided should reflect 'normal' landings in the fishery in recent years. Ideally this should be a list of landings (or estimated landings) by species for the past 3 years. Applicants should also indicate the source of the data.

When  providing  species  names,  please  list  both  the  common  and  scientific  names  whenever possible, as common names can vary between and even within countries.

## Example:

Landings data for the past 4 seasons can be found here: https://www.afma.gov.au/fisheries/smallpelagic-fishery/spf-catch-data. Latin names for target species can be found here : https://www.afma.gov.au/fisheries/small-pelagic-fishery.

## 2. Governance and policy information

## What is it?

Here,  the  MarinTrust  Standard  refers  to  the wider  legal  framework  within  which  the  fishery operates. There may be a formal legal framework (international and/or national policies, laws and regulations), and/or there may be a customary framework (including customs and traditions that are protected by law).

## What do assessment teams need to see?

- · Local, national and international laws, regulations and agreements that govern any element of the fishery process, information on how the fishery ensures that it meets these requirements, and evidence of compliance.

- · Any policy documents or management plans that provide guidance to the fishery management system.
- · List of organisations or groups involved in, or potentially impacted by, the fishery and information on how these stakeholders (including the fishery client) can participate in the fishery management or policy-making system.

## Example:

Overall management of the fishery is the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy, specifically the Undersecretariat  of  fisheries  (SUBPESCA  SSP -http://www.subpesca.cl/portal/616/w3-article86158.html ) and the National Fisheries Service (SERNAPESCA -http://www.sernapesca.cl/ ). Data collection  and  analysis  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Fisheries  Development  Institute  (IFOP -https://www.ifop.cl/ ). SERNAPESCA  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring  and  enforcement  of regulations, with the support of the coast guard and navy.

The main pieces of fishery legislation are:

- · Ley 25977 Ley General de Pesca (Artículos del 76° al 83°)
- · Decreto Supremo 012-2001-PE Reglamento de la Ley General de Pesca (Artículos del 126° al 150°)
- · Decreto Supremo 016-2007-PRODUCE Reglamento de Inspecciones y Sanciones Pesqueras Acuícolas.

## 3. Fishery- specific Management Information

## What is it?

This is a fishery's own management policy related directly to how the fishery operates. This could be a fishery management plan or other policy document relating to the fishery directly, whether at local,  national  or  regional  level  and/or  policies  and  statements  of  objectives  from  commercial stakeholders. This also includes information on the day-to-day operation of the fishery (e.g. decision making, monitoring, control and surveillance, review of the management system).

## What do assessment teams need to see?

- · Policies or statements of objectives relating to the fishery.
- · Details of monitoring, control and surveillance system at sea and quayside (e.g. at-sea inspection, quayside inspections, cross-checking of logbook and landings data, observers, VMS, CCTV, etc.). This includes details of any infractions by the client fishery and how these were dealt with. (Note: minor accidental infractions are not likely to be an issue for MarinTrust approval; for major infractions, show how the operation of the fishery has been adapted to ensure that there is no repeat.)
- · Details of how the fishery is kept informed about regulations (e.g. information from authorities or protection officers, instructions to skippers, etc.).

## 4. Information on Stocks

## What is it?

This is information about the condition of all stocks being fished and how this is monitored.

## What do assessment teams need to see?

- · Assessment teams need to know the reference points that are used to evaluate stock status and/or fishing mortality, how they were calculated, and the status of the stock in relation to these reference points. This is usually available in stock assessment reports.
- · Assessment teams need to know how the stock is being monitored, including the details of any scientific models, the data that goes into them and how the fishery uses this information for management.
- · Assessment teams need similar data on species caught by the fishery other than the target species, even if not specifically targeted by the fishery, to ensure that they are not being adversely affected by fishing effort. This includes both weight of species caught and an indication of how this relates to the overall population status of that species.
- · If the species forms a low proportion of the total catch by weight (less than 5%), you may not need to consider it in as much detail, unless the species is known to be less  resilient  to  fishing  pressure  (generally  long  lived,  low  fecundity species  such  as most sharks). However, if data are available, they will still be useful.

## What if you don't have this information?

If reference points are not defined for the fishery or if formal data to assess stock status are not available,  another  method  of  assessment  called  the Risk-Based  approach may  be  used  by  the assessment team, either for the target stock or for other species caught by the fishery. In this case, some  data  over  time  on  catch,  effort,  CPUE,  fish  length  and  age  indexes,  sex  ratio,  catch composition, species distribution, etc. may be used instead as indicators (proxy data) to identify and score the most vulnerable aspect affected by the fishing activity.

## Example:

Details of the Baltic Sea sprat stock assessment can be found here: http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2019/2019/spr.27.22-32.pdf.

Further information on species with no stock assessment might be found on third-party websites, for example:

SFP FishSource -https://www.sustainablefish.org/Programs/Science/FishSource

## 5. Harvest Strategy

## What is it?

This refers to the mechanisms used by the fishery to moderate its fishing effort should it become apparent that current levels of fishing effort are causing stock levels to decline.

## What do assessment teams need to see?

- · External  regulations  (such  as  quota  limits,  effort limitations, minimum  sizes,  gear restrictions and technical measures, etc.) that aim to control the exploitation of the stocks.
- · Internal  rules  and  triggers  for  modifying  fishing  effort  when  data  available  suggest  that current levels are too great.
- · Records of how this is monitored and when/how it has been enforced/followed in the past.
- · This information is explicitly needed for the target stock(s) but will also be useful for other stocks caught by the fishery, whether targeted, retained or discarded.

## Example:

The Gulf Menhaden fishery is managed according to the Regional Management Plan available here: https://www.gsmfc.org/publications/GSMFC%20Number%20240.pdf. Additional  information  can also be found on the GSMFC website, here: https://www.gsmfc.org/

## 6 -Ecosystem Impacts

## What is it?

This investigates the impact of the fishery on the wider ecosystem in which it operates and how fishery management monitors and moderates its effect.

## What do assessment teams need to see?

- · Records of the internal and/or external restrictions placed upon the fishery in order to monitor its impact upon the following:
- o Bycatch/Discarded species
- o Endangered, Threatened or Protected (ETP) species
- o Habitats
- o Wider ecosystem
- · Information about the actions taken by the fishery to control these impacts (e.g. closed areas, gear selection, gear modifications, fishing time/place/season, etc.).
- · Details  of  how  impacts  are  monitored  (e.g. logbooks,  observer  reports,  VMS/AIS,  selfsampling, scientific monitoring and mapping programmes, ecosystem empirical research and/or modelling, etc.).

- · Details of species  legally protected  in  the  fishery's country  or  area  of  operation (e.g. national protected species lists; this may include marine mammals, reptiles, birds, fish or shellfish).
- · Information about how the fishery deals with, and tries to minimize, mortality of unwanted catches.
- · Any information about unobserved mortality (e.g. as a result of gear loss, illegal fishing, injury/stress from fishing resulting in mortality).

## Example:

A list of ETP species found in Japanese waters is provided here: https://www.jfa.maff.go.jp/j/press/sigen/170321.html. Other reports relevant to the fishery include:

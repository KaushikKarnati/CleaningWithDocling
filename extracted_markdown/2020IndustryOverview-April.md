## FLORIDA AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Aquaculture

## AQUACULTURE IS AGRICULTURE

The Florida  Aquaculture  Policy  Act (Chapter  597,  Florida  Statutes)  established  that aquaculture is agriculture, and consolidated state regulatory responsibilities under the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). Florida's aquaculture industry produces the greatest variety of aquatic species of any state in the nation.  Moreover,  aquaculture  is  Florida's  most diverse agribusiness. The state's subtropical climate, extensive marine and freshwater resources, cargo shipping infrastructure and extensive coastline have made the state's aquaculture industry uniquely diverse. There are approximately 1,000 certified aquaculture farms in  Florida ,  located  in  every  region  of  the  state (Figure  1),  which  produce  an  estimated 1,500 varieties of fish, aquatic plants, mollusks, crustaceans, turtles, amphibians and alligators for ornamental, food and bait markets as well as for sporting, conservation and educational purposes.

## MAJOR AQUACULTURE COMMODITIES

Below is a production summary report for major aquaculture  commodity  groups  in  Florida.  The industry data are as reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)  National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), including the Florida Field Office/Florida Agricultural Statistics Service. The USDA Census of Agriculture

has been conducted every 4-5 years since 1920 (most recently conducted in 2007, 2012 and 2017), and the Census of Aquaculture was conducted in 2005, 2013 and 2018. Additional data from 1989-2012 were collected via surveys by the USDA NASS Florida Field Office in cooperation with the FDACS Division of Aquaculture. All reported sales are farm gate values in real dollars not adjusted for inflation. The data provided in this summary are the most up-todate and accurate statistics available on Florida's aquaculture industry.

Farm gate sales of Florida aquaculture products (in real dollars) as reported by the USDA totaled approximately $75 million in  2005, $68.8 million in 2012 and $71.6 million in

## ALLIGATORS

Alligators are the primary aquatic reptile aquaculture product in Florida. Beginning in St. Augustine at the turn of the 20 th  century, alligator aquaculture for hides, meat and tourism began to increase in popularity and profitability and continues to be a robust industry today. In 2005, 12 out of 14 operations reported sales of alligator or alligator products totaling $4.07 million. Hides and meat accounted for $3.6 million (90%) of sales in 2005. In 2012, sales from live animals at 7 farms totaled $1.4 million and sales from eggs, hides and meats at 5 farms totaled $6.6 million. In 2018, there were 14 total reported operations with sales: 5 operations for hides, 11 for meat and 6 for whole animals. Only meat sales were reported (for farmer confidentiality) in 2018  totaling , $397,000 from 11 operations (Table 2).

## AQUATIC PLANTS

Aquatic plants include those grown for water gardens, aquariums, food markets (such as watercress)  and  wetland  restoration.  In  2005,  20  operations  reported  sales  of  aquatic plants  totaling $17.6  million (USDA  2006), $8.4  million of  which  (48%)  was  for ornamental markets from 17 operations. In 2012, sales (excluding those for food markets) totaled $5.3 million from 19 operations. Sales from aquatic plants in Florida peaked in 2001  at $21.3  million (Table  2),  and  the  industry  has  been  in  decline  since.  Business owners  attribute  the  significant  reduction  in  sales  to  an  overall  decline  in  aquaria hobbyists in the U.S. over the past two decades. In 2018, sales of algae (sea vegetables and

microalgae) from 5 operations totaled $76,000 ; other aquatic plants were not included in the 2018 Census of Aquaculture .

Figure  2. Total  farm  gate  sales  value  (in  thousands  of  dollars)  for  all  Florida  aquaculture commodities, 1989-2018. Based on FDACS internal data, the average survey response rate from operations with sales in 2003 through 2018 was only 39% (Source: Florida Agricultural Statistics Service 1990-2004; USDA 2006, 2013, 2019).

## ORNAMENTALS

The ornamental industry includes marine and freshwater fish, marine and freshwater invertebrates, snails, coral and live rock. Florida consistently ranks first in the nation for ornamental fish production -approximately 45% of the total U.S. ornamental economy -and is the largest sector of Florida's aquaculture industry (Figures 3 -4). The total sales from all ornamental commodities, including freshwater and marine fish, coral, live rock, aquarium plants and other marine and freshwater invertebrates was $35 million in 2012 (USDA 2013).

&amp; Ornamental fish sales in 2005 totaled $33.2 million from 133 operations and $27.3 million in 2012 from 101 operations (Table 2). Live rock sales from 6 operations totaled $341,000 in 2005 and $373,000 from 12 operations in 2012. Live rock was produced at 17 operations in  2018,  although  sales  data  were  withheld  for  farmer  confidentiality.  In  2018,  total ornamental fish sales totaled $28.7 million from 109 operations, a 5% increase over 2012 and by far the highest value of any state in the nation (Table 3). More specifically, Florida ranked first in the nation for sales of koi, saltwater ornamental fish and freshwater ornamental fish in 2018 (Table 3).

Table 2. Farm gate sales (in thousands of dollars) annual total and for select Florida aquaculture commodities, 1997-2018. Based on FDACS internal data, the average survey response rate from operations with sales in 2003, 2005, 2012 and 2018 was 39% (Source: Florida Agricultural Statistics Service 1998-2004; USDA 2006, 2013, 2019).

Notes: Aquatic plants for food markets (watercress) were not reported in 2012; Survey response rate was calculated from the number of total operations with sales reported by FASS/USDA and the number of total operations certified with FDACS (internal data available starting in 2002); Alligator sales in 2018 are meat values only.

- * Value in 2001 includes clams only; oysters in 2001 were counted as 'other aquatics.' Clam sales in 2001, 2003 and 2005 were reported to include clam seed.
- ** Value includes catfish, til apia and minor commodities reported as 'other' or 'miscellaneous aquaculture.' Due to inconsistency in reporting, this value does not include data on other fish, whether used for sport, stocking, conservation, education or food.

## FOOD FISH

Food  fish  species  produced  in  Florida  include  tilapia,  catfish,  sturgeon,  striped  bass, cobia, pompano and red drum. Sales were reported from 49 farms in 2005, including catfish, tilapia, sturgeon and bass, for a total of $3.6 million . Of these, 26 farms reported sales for catfish ( $1.4 million ), 18 for sales of tilapia ( $477,000 ) and 19 for sales of bass, carp and sturgeon ( $1.7 million )(USDA 2006).

In 2012, food fish sales were reported from 95 farms for a total of $4.6 million. Catfish sales were reported from 17 farms for a total of $390,000 (a 73% decrease from 2005), 47 farms reported sales of tilapia for a total of $1.2 million (a 157% increase from 2005) and 31 farms reported sales of $2.98 million for other species including bass, sturgeon, carp, cobia,  pompano  and  red  drum.  Additionally,  13  farms  reported  shrimp  sales  of $7.5 million in 2012 (USDA 2013).

In 2018, food fish sales were reported from 46 farms for a total of $3.96 million (a 14% decrease from 2012). Overall, Florida ranked 12 th  in the nation for total food fish sales in 2018 (USDA 2019). Catfish sales reported from 18 operations ( $302,000 ) accounted for 8% of total food fish sales and tilapia sales from 17 operations ( $1.5 million )

<!-- image -->

accounted for 39% of total food fish sales. From 2012 to 2018, catfish sales decreased by 23%  and  tilapia  sales  increased  by  26%.  Striped  bass  from  5  operations  added  an additional $714,000 in sales (18% of total food fish sales) . Shrimp were produced at 11 farms, but sales data were not reported for farmer confidentiality.

## SHELLFISH

Hard  clams  dominate  shellfish  aquaculture  in  Florida,  and  most  of  the  hard  clam production  occurs  in  Levy  County  (Figure  1).  Other  shellfish  produced  in  the  state include oysters and sunray venus clams. In 2005, sales of clam, clam seed and oysters from 153 operations totaled $10.7  million (down from $13 million in 2003), with 142 operations reporting hard clam sales of $9.8 million (92% of total sales). In 2012, sales reported by 139 operations totaled $11.9  million ,  with  hard  clams  bringing  in $11.65 million (98% of total sales). In 2018, clams and oysters from 111 operations brought in $15.5  million in  sales,  a  31%  increase  from  2012.  Clam  sales  were  reported  from  95 operations, totaling $14.3 million (92% of sales). Florida ranked third in the nation for total clam sales and sixth for sales of oysters in 2018 (USDA 2019).

Hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 negatively impacted Florida's coastal zone, where clams are cultured,  and  in  addition  to  large  production  losses  in  2004,  55  clam  farmers reported going out of business between 2003 and 2005. Nevertheless, Florida's shellfish  industry  has  seen  strong  growth.  The  number  of  water  column  and

<!-- image -->

submerged land leases for clam and oyster aquaculture has increased by 360% since 2003. At the end of 2019, there were 719 commercial leases in use (among 336 producers), with 406 (56%) producing hard clams, 112 (16%) producing oysters and 201 (28%) producing both hard clams and oysters (FDACS internal data, 2019).

## OTHER COMMODITIES

Other  aquaculture  commodities  include  turtles,  frogs,  baitfish  (including  fathead minnows, shiners and novel marine species such as pinfish, killifish and croakers) and recreational game fish used for stocking (including largemouth bass, bluegill, catfish and crappie). Florida's baitfish industry increased from two farms in 2005 to 12 farms in 2012, reporting $41,000 in sales in 2012. Sportfish sales were reported from ten farms for a total of $97,000 in  2012,  a  sharp  decline  from $191,000 reported  in  2005.  Turtles  and  turtle products were reported from 28 operations with $1.2 million in sales in 2012. In 2018, 45 operations had $7.9 million in total sales from minor and miscellaneous commodities. Sportfish and baitfish were produced at three and five farms, respectively, but sales data were not reported for farmer confidentiality. Turtles were produced at 14 farms in 2018 for a total of $875,000 in sales.

## LABOR &amp; METHODS OF PRODUCTION

Florida aquaculture commodities are produced in a wide variety of ways. Table 4 and Figure 5 below show the number of farms that used a particular production method and the number of production units for each method in 2005, 2013 and 2018 (the years of data available from the USDA Census of Aquaculture ).

In 2005, 2,292 acres of freshwater were used for production on 196 farms and 718 acres of saltwater 2  were used on 163 farms; 52% of operations were less than 3 acres in size. In 2013, 238 operations used 2,003 acres of freshwater and 169 operations used 1,078 acres of saltwater; 61% of operations were less than 3 acres in size. In 2018, 172 operations used 2,541 acres of freshwater and 178 operations used 869 acres of saltwater.

In 2005, 359 farm operators reported a total of 1,055 workers at an average of 31 hours per week. Of these, 158 operations (44%) had 262 unpaid workers (typically partners or family members) and 195 (54%) reported paid workers for a total of $12.4 million in payroll.

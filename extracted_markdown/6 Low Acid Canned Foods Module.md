Seafood Processing Standard -- Low Acid Canned Foods Module

## A Introduction

Low  Acid  Canned  Food  (LACF)  processing  has  unique  attributes  that  require adherence  to  specific guidelines to ensure the control of associated food borne pathogens such as Clostridium botulinum and Listeria  monocytogenes. The purpose of the LACF module is to provide clauses that facilities shall be audited against during the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) Seafood Processing Standard audit, for facilities that process hermetically sealed (canned and/or pouched) seafood. The clauses stated within this module reflect global  industry  best  practices,  international scientific data,  and  global  regulatory  guidance. This module shall be audited in combination with the Core Seafood Processing Standard 6.0.

## B  Scope

A low acid food is any food with an equilibrium pH of greater than 4.6 and water activity greater than 0.85 sealed  in  a  hermetically  sealed  container  and  receives  a  heat  treatment  for  the  purpose  of  achieving commercial  sterility,  normally  stored  under  non-refrigerated  conditions.  Examples  include  canned  or pouched seafood.

## C Clause Requirements

LACF1

Facilities that produce shelfstable acidified foods and low -acid canned foods in hermetically sealed  containers,  canning,  retorts,  aseptic  processing,  and  product  formulating  systems (including systems wherein water activity is used in conjunction with thermal processing) shall demonstrate their compliance with regulations of the country of production and the country of export to control these processes. A copy of the relevant regulatory guidance that was applied shall be maintained.

LACF2

Operators  of  the  processing  systems  detailed  in  LACF1  (including  container  closure inspectors) shall be under the supervision of a person who has successfully completed the prescribed course of instruction (Better Process Control School) approved by the regulatory agencies for giving instruction appropriate to the preservation technology involved in the country of production and, if required, the country of export.

LACF3 For  low  acid  foods,  the  scheduled  process  developed  by  the  Process  Authority  shall  be validated for use under the conditions for achieving and maintaining commercial sterility.

LACF4 The  LACF  process  controls  of  scheduled  processes  including,  but  not  limited  to,  heat distribution,  heat  penetration  studies,  and  process  validation  shall  be  conducted  at  a minimum every 5 years or if there are changes to the process or retort configuration, by a recognized Process Authority. Annual retort surveys shall be conducted and be approved by a competent Process Authority.

The facility shall have regular sampling and visual inspections for metal, glass containers, and pouches if used, including can teardown inspections, in place to identify closure defects. The  frequency  of  inspection  shall  be  based  on  a  risk  assessment  with  a  minimum  of  1 container every 4 hours from each container closing station.  Results shall be recorded, and

LACF5 corrective actions taken as required.

- LACF6 Container  cooling  water  shall  be  chlorinated  or  otherwise  sanitized  as  necessary  with adequate contact time for cooling canals and for recirculated water supplies. The facility shall ensure, per regulatory requirements, a measurable residual of the sanitizer employed at the water discharge point of the container cooler. Records of monitoring sanitizer residual

levels of cooling water discharge shall be kept.

- LACF7 Container cooling water shall be of low microbial content with an aerobic plate count of less than 100 cfu/ml or comply with applicable regulatory requirements, whichever is stricter. Frequency of testing shall be determined by risk assessment. Records shall be kept of its microbiological quality.
- LACF8 Reviewers for records of LACF product and HACCP must have a high level of training specific to these food safety areas, for example, completion of the US FDA Better Process Control School course or equivalent.
- LACF9 For aseptic processing and packaging systems, the facility shall have in place equipment, container,  and  closure  sterilization  procedures  to  ensure  commercial  sterility.  Accurate documentation of pre-sterilization shall be available.

## A Introduction

Environmental responsibility is an essential pillar of the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) Seafood Processing Standard. Seafood processing facilities that fit within the scope of this module, treat their own effluents, and discharge into a natural water body shall be  audited against the clauses in this module and are required to meet GSA effluent parameters as described herein. This module shall be audited in combination with the Core Seafood Processing Standard 6.0.

## B  Scope

The scope of this module covers effluent discharge requirements for seafood processing facilities not defined as a remote wild processing facility . Note: GSA defines a remote wild processing facility as being only accessible by sea or air, or that is more than 30 minutes travel by land from a metropolitan area with a population of 10,000 or greater and only processes wild -caught seafood products.

## C Clause Requirements

## C1 Exemptions

The auditor shall complete this section (C1) only if the facility is claiming an exemption for either no effluent discharge to a natural water body or if all effluent is discharged to a municipality. If the facility does not qualify for an exemption, this section is to be left blank and the auditor should go directly to section C2.

EFF1 Exemption for No Discharge :  The  facility qualifies for an  exemption because they do not discharge  to  a  natural  water  body and  meet  local  or  national  government  permits  and regulations.

Examples  of  natural  water  bodies  include  coastal  waters,  bays,  estuar ies , canals,  etc. Examples  of  no  discharge:  effluents  used  for  irrigation  or  other  purpose s  preventing discharge to naturally occurring water bodies. Auditor is to verify through records and site inspection. If verified, this module is complete.

Exemption for Discharge to Municipality : The facility qualifies for an exemption because they discharge  to  a  municipality  or  private  treatment  plant. Auditor  to  verify  through  site

- EFF2 inspection and records.

EFF2.1 Plants shall not exceed local or national government permitted load levels when discharging effluents to a municipal or industrial treatment facility.

## C2 Onsite Effluent Management

- EFF3 Facilities shall have a valid government permit for discharge into a naturally occurring water body (sea, river, estuary, etc.) . The facility shall provide the auditor with a description and diagram of the effluent process.
- EFF3.1 If no  government  permits  are  required  the  facility  shall  need  to  have  conducted  an environmental impact assessment on the scale and level of effluent that can be discharged into this naturally occurring water body .

## C3 Mixing Zone -for Marine Environments Only (Alternate Option 1)

Facilities discharging directly to high energy marine environments may elect an alternative approach to compliance by demonstrating that the water quality concentrations (of parameters listed in Table 1) at the edge of an established mixing zone are less than, or equal to, concentrations measured upstream of the discharge pipe.

EFF8

When a Mixing Zone option is used, the facility  shall  demonstrate it  can  comply with the following:

EFF8.1

A mixing zone radius exceeding 10m in length shall be established by a hydrological study conducted by a licensed environmental engineering entity.

EFF8.2

Quarterly monitoring of parameters listed in Table 1 shall be conducted at a point on the downstream  edge  and  another  point  upstream  of  the  established  mixing  zone. GPS coordinates shall be provided to identify locations of sampling.

EFF8.3

Mixing  zone  sampling  results  shall  demonstrate  that  concentrations  do  not  increase between downstream and upstream monitoring points.

EFF8.4 Under the mixing zone option samples shall be monitored on a quarterly basis.

## Implementation

A mixing zone is the defined portion of a waterbody where a permitted wastewater discharge undergoes initial dilution. Specific water quality criteria are permitted to exceed the numeric limits for those criteria within this defined area. Water immediately outside the permitted mixing zone is required to meet all water quality criteria listed in Table 1.

## C4 Assimilative Capacity Study -for Marine Environments Only (Alternate Option 2)

Facilities discharging to marine environments unable to comply with the variable limits listed in Table 1 may elect to have assimilative capacity studies that clearly demonstrate that their effluent discharge produces no adverse effects on the receiving wa ter bodies.

EFF9

When the  assimilative  capacity  study  option is  used,  t he  study  shall  be  conducted  by  a qualified third party, -shall be made available for auditor review, and shall be current.

EFF9.1

Facilities shall record and submit to the certification body water quality monitoring parameter results per the frequency listed in Table 1 and report the average annual concentrations for each parameter as shown in the table.

## Implementation

Assimilative capacity studies must be conducted by a qualified third -party  and  updated annually.  This option is only available for facilities for which assimilative capacity studies are also allowed by permits or local or national regulatory requirements.

## A - Introduction

Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) is an international, non-profit (501c 6) corporation registered in Delaware, USA with principal offices based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. GSA seeks to provide comprehensive and credible seafood supply-chain assurances while addressing gaps in seafood certification. These assurances will flow from third-party certification programs to ensure seafood supply chains meet strict environmental, social and food safety standards.

## Background to the Standard

The Responsible Fishing Vessel Standard (RFVS) is a voluntary, vessel-based program certifying high standards of operational practices relating to crew safety and welfare on board fishing vessels. The RFVS is an assurance tool to help fishing vessel owners and support vessel operators showcase industry-agreed best practice through independent, third-party auditing.

Since  2018,  GSA  and  Seafish,  the  public  body  set  up  to  support  the  UK  seafood  industry,  have  worked  in partnership to develop the RFVS. The RFVS is the next iteration of Seafish's Responsible Fishing Scheme (RFS) and it builds on the experience of the UK sector and reflects future industry needs across the global supply chain.

The RFVS is now owned and operated by GSA and is applicable to all types of commercially licenced fishing vessels, subject to them meeting the scope and eligibility criteria detailed in this document. GSA's intent is to deliver and grow the RFVS so that it becomes a global assurance model for commercial fishing vessels.

## RFVS Standard Development

A robust standard development process was followed to ensure the RFVS is fit for purpose and meets market needs.  Input  was  incorporated  from  all  sectors  of  the  global  seafood  industry:  catching,  processing,  retail, standard holders and non-government organisations (NGOs). The GSA and Seafish Boards entrusted the RFS Oversight Board to oversee the strategic direction and objectives of the RFVS.

A  comprehensive  consultation  and  fully  transparent  engagement  process  was  launched  in  July  2018.    The process included two key consultation phases:

- 1) An initial consultation phase to determine what key aspects of the Seafish RFS should be retained, amended, or removed, and what should be added for RFVS Issue 1 to appropriately provide assurance of operational best practices and fair working condition aboard vessels to the global seafood market.
- 2) A 60-day public consultation phase - to allow feedback on the proposed RFVS criteria. The consultation ran from August 15 to October 14, 2019.

Prior  to  the  initial  consultation  phase  a  comprehensive  stakeholder  mapping  exercise  was  conducted  to underpin all consultations. This aimed to identify all stakeholders who were directly and indirectly affected by the Seafish RFS program, both domestically and internationally. All identified stakeholders were proactively encouraged to engage with the process.

## The Key RFVS Development Stages

- · Formation of Technical Working  Groups (TWGs)  with membership  comprised of individuals representing organizations from across the globe, with the key skills required to develop the standard criteria for each agreed core principle. See the Acknowledgements section for TWG members.
- · The RFVS criteria were tested on a specified number of supply chains to ensure that the auditability of the  standard  criteria  met  ISO-17065  certification  protocols  and  international  social  benchmark requirements:
- o UK vessels supplying UK market;
- o UK vessels supplying the export market; and
- o International supply chains sourcing from non-UK registered fishing vessels.
- · 60-day public consultation, to capture stakeholder feedback, prior to the finalizing RFVS criteria.
- · The RFVS criteria were approved by the Oversight Board in December 2019. The Seafish &amp; GSA Boards granted their approval of the Criteria in March 2020.
- · RFVS support documentation created in accordance with ISO 17065 certification protocols, outlining the compliance requirements for an RFVS applicant and certification requirements for the Certification Body to assess an applicant.
- · A full set of auditor training tools developed to ensure that all RFVS auditors assess compliance to the RFVS criteria with credibility and consistency.

## Acknowledgements

The development process was conducted by the RFVS development team which composed of representatives from Seafish and GSA and their work has been overseen by an independent Oversight Board and supported by independent Technical Working Groups comprising over 30 seafood stakeholders in the UK and internationally. A group of Peer Reviewers also provided expert input.

GSA and Seafish would like to jointly express their thanks and appreciation to the following individuals and organisations that provided their time and expertise to help develop the RFVS:

## B - Standard Scope and Structure

The RFVS scope is underpinned by two core principles:

## Core Principle 1 - Vessel Management &amp; Safety Systems

- · Management Policies and Procedures
- · Environmental Impact Management
- · Catch Traceability Management
- · Vessel License to Operate
- · Catch Safety and Food Hygiene

## Core Principle 2 - Crew Rights, Safety and Wellbeing

- · Crew Rights and Integrity
- · Crew Health and Safety

The overall objective of the RFVS is:

'The Responsible Fishing Vessel Standard enables fishing and support operations to provide assurance of decent working conditions and operational best practice from the catch to the shore.'

The RFVS is accessible to any single commercially licensed fishing vessel or fleet of vessels or support/tender vessels, globally which meet the following eligibility criteria:

- · Operate legally within a legal fishery that they are entitled to fish or support;
- · Comply with the fishing vessel registration and licensing requirements of the flag State to which it is registered;
- · Comply with the regulatory controls of the country or RFMO which controls the fishery, if operating in fisheries under the jurisdiction of countries where they are not registered;
- · Comply with the legal requirements for vessel and crew safety for the fishery they fish in, including all applicable national labor and social security laws.  When national legal requirements exceed any requirements of the RFVS for worker protections, these must be adhered to.
- · Meet or exceed the human rights requirements of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
- · Do not use illegitimate methods of harvesting and predator control as defined within the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries;
- · Do not use forced labor, persons under 16 years old or non-voluntary prisoners as crew; and
- · If operated by a lone fisher, does not remain continually at sea for more than 24 hours without breaks from fishing activities.
- · Is not engaged in any acts of corruption, embezzlement, or bribery, either directly or indirectly.

The eligibility criteria set out the behaviours and conditions that applicants must follow to achieve and maintain certification  to  the  RFVS.  Any  vessel  or  fleet  of  vessels  or  support/tender  vessels,  that  do  not  meet  these eligibility criteria shall not be accepted into the program for possible certification. Once certified, if a member is found to no longer meet the eligibility criteria certification can be suspended and potentially withdrawn.

In certain circumstances where very serious Human Rights issues are identified on board a vessel either applying to be certified or is currently certified to the RFVS program, GSA shall implement a Zero-Tolerance policy for the following categories of Human Rights violations.

- ● Use of forced/prison labour including the use of debt bondage and human trafficking  1
- ● Use of illegal child labour . 1
- ● Actual observed Violence and /or intimidation, whether physical, sexual, or mental . 1
- ● Actual observed Negligent endangerment of vessel safety 1

If a vessel or group is found to be in breach of these Zero Tolerance criteria the applicant or current certificate holder shall be withdrawn from the program and they must enact a remediation policy to resolve the issues. The vessel or group shall not be allowed to re-join the program until this remediation has been completed and shall not be able to reapply for RFVS certification for at least 2 calendar years from the point at which they were withdrawn from the program.

## RFVS Vessel Certification Categories

The RFVS program has categorised vessels by length of fishing activity, as well as differentiating between singleperson operated (single-handed) and crewed vessels. This will ensure that the standard is accessible for all types of commercial licenced fishing vessels.

As  length  of  time  at  sea  is  a  key  factor  in  determining  crew  health,  safety  and  wellbeing  and  is  applicable irrespective of vessel length or tonnage, the following vessel categories will apply to this version of the RFVS:

- · Single-person operated vessels exclusively worked by an owner
- · Crewed vessel at sea for less than 24 hours
- · Crewed vessels at sea for 24-71 hours
- · Crewed vessels at sea for 72 hours up to 30 days
- · Crewed vessels at sea for 30 days or more
- · Crewed Support/Tender vessels that directly service/assist a commercial fishing vessel or fleet

## RFVS Clause Categories

Each  RFVS  clause  has  been  identified  as  either  an  Essential  Requirement  or  Supplementary  Requirement. Applicability shall be determined by vessel certification category.

- 1. Essential Requirement - shall need to be met at the time of audit for certification to be achieved by an applicant.
- 2. Supplementary  Requirement -  shall  need  to  be  adhered  to  within  a  set  period  following  initial certification. The specified time limit for compliance will be confirmed to the applicant at the time of their certification.

The  RFVS  clause  categorisation,  and  the  timescales  within  which  Supplementary  Requirements  must  be complied with, has been determined by the Technical Working Groups during the development of the RFVS and approved by the RFVS Governance Structure.

The  introduction  of  Supplementary  Requirements  recognises  that  some  vessels  and  practices  may  need additional investment or training. It will therefore allow for applicants to demonstrate their commitment to making improvements, subject to strict timelines.

## RFVS Unit of Certification

The unit of certification shall include the vessel, skipper and the owner(s) of the vessel, if they are different from the person ordinarily in charge of the vessel whilst at sea. This reflects that it is the vessel owner's responsibility to ensure an effective management system and crew welfare culture is in place and adhered to by all individuals who may take charge of the vessel. While operating, it is the skipper/captain/person ordinary in charge of the

vessel  responsibility  to  ensure  all  crew  onboard  are  provided  safe,  healthy,  and  hygienic  conditions  while working at sea as covered by the 'Safety Of Life At Sea' (SOLAS) an international Maritime Organization treat.

There will be two different Units of Certification:

- 1. A single vessel operated by an owner/skipper/captain; or
- 2. A group or fleet of vessels operated under the control and scrutiny of an organisation to which the vessels are affiliated.  The support/tender vessel if used within a group will be part of this type of certificate only

The group unit of certification shall include the vessels, the persons ordinarily in charge of the vessels whilst at sea and the organisation that manages and controls them. All vessels in the group shall be subject to continuous surveillance and internal audits by the company or organisation making the application. The internal audits and systems must be robust and credible as they replace the need for the Certification Body to assess every vessel in the group prior to certification being awarded.

The following international conventions and protocols have been used to underpin the development of the RFVS:

## Core Principle One - Vessel Management &amp; Safety Systems

## Core Principle One Intent

The vessel operations shall be managed by a set of policies, processes and procedures that are required for the planning and execution (catching/storage) of its core business areas (i.e. areas that can impact the vessel's ability to  meet its legal obligations and fulfil its customer requirements). The vessel can evidence this by having a documented management system to demonstrate that the vessel operates in a manner capable of meeting the requirements of this Standard.

The vessel shall be maintained in a safe and seaworthy condition to demonstrate that the crew are provided with a safe working environment that is free from high risk hazards that could cause injury or endanger life. The vessel can demonstrate this by having evidence that the vessel meets, at a minimum, the requirements of the nominal references that underpin this Standard.

Core Principle 1 shall feature the following sections:

Section 1 - Management Policies and Procedures (including Vessel Safety) ;

Section 2 - Environmental Impact Management;

Section 3 - Catch Traceability Management;

Section 4 - Vessel License to Operate; and

Section 5 - Catch Safety and Food Hygiene

The intent of this section is to demonstrate that the vessel has overarching management policies, procedures, and  systems  in  place  to  support  the  demonstration  of  compliance  with  international  standards  and conventions which are within the scope of this Standard.

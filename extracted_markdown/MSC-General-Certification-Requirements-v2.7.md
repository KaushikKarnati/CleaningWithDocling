## About the Marine Stewardship Council

## Vision

Our vision is of the world's oceans teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations.

## Mission

Our mission is to use our ecolabel and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world's  oceans  by  recognising  and  rewarding  sustainable  fishing  practices,  influencing  the  choices people make when buying seafood, and working with our partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis.

## General introduction

## MSC Standards and Certification Requirements

With experts and following international consultation with stakeholders, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) has developed standards for sustainable fishing and seafood traceability. The Standards ensure that MSC labelled seafood comes from, and can be traced back to, a sustainable fishery.

The  MSC  Standards  and  Certification  Requirements  meet  global  best  practice  guidelines  for certification and ecolabelling programs.

## Fisheries certification

The MSC Fisheries Standard sets out requirements that a fishery must meet to enable it to claim that its fish come from a well-managed and sustainable source.

Throughout the world fisheries are using good management practices to safeguard jobs, secure fish stocks for the future and help protect the marine environment. The science-based MSC environmental standard  for  sustainable  fishing  offers  fisheries  a  way  to  confirm  sustainability,  using  a  credible, independent third-party assessment process. It means sustainable fisheries can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace, and give an assurance to consumers that their seafood comes from a well-managed and sustainable source.

The  MSC  Fisheries  Standard  applies  to  wild-capture  fisheries  that  meet  the  scope  requirements provided in the Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) v2.3 Section 7.4/ Fisheries Standard v3.0.

The MSC Fisheries Standard is comprised of 3 core principles:

## Principle 1: Sustainable target fish stocks

A fishery must be conducted in a manner that does not lead to over-fishing or depletion of exploited populations. For those populations that are depleted, the fishery must be conducted in a manner that demonstrably leads to their recovery.

## Principle 2: Environmental impact of fishing

Fishing operations allow for the maintenance of the structure, productivity, function and diversity of the ecosystem (including habitat and associated dependent and ecologically related species) on which the fishery depends.

## Principle 3: Effective management

The fishery is subject to an effective management system that respects local, national and international laws and standards and incorporates institutional and operational frameworks that require use of the resource to be responsible and sustainable.

## Chain of Custody certification

Before the  MSC ecolabel can be used on seafood, or any claim about the MSC can be made, an assessment must take place at each preceding step in the process that confirms the product originates from a fishery certified to the MSC Fisheries Standard.

Chain of Custody (CoC) certification provides credible assurance that products sold with the certification program trademarks can be traced through the supply chain to a certified source. To achieve this, organisations in the supply chain are subject to certification against the MSC Chain of Custody Standard for seafood traceability.

The MSC owns the MSC Chain of Custody Standard: Default Version and two variants: the MSC Chain of  Custody  Standard:  Group  Version  and  the  MSC  Chain  of  Custody  Standard:  Consumer-Facing Organisation Version. Further information on eligibility for each version of the CoC Standard can be found in  the  CoC  Certification  Requirements  (CoCCR)  Section 6.2 and  in  the  introduction  to  each document.

Document: MSC General Certification Requirements v2.7 Date of publication: 24 th January May 2025

The MSC CoC Standard is comprised of 5 core principles:

Principle 1: Certified products are purchased from certified suppliers

Principle 2: Certified products are identifiable

Principle 3: Certified products are segregated

Principle 4: Certified products are traceable and volumes are recorded

Principle 5: The organisation has a management system

## Use of MSC Chain of Custody by other standard setters

The  Aquaculture  Stewardship  Council  (ASC),  and  the  jointly  owned  ASC-MSC  Seaweed  (Algae) Standard use the MSC Chain of Custody Program to assure the traceability of ASC/ ASC-MSC certified aquaculture  and  seaweed  products  through  their  supply  chains.  Although  this  is  an  important collaboration, the ASC remains a separate organisation that uses a different logo. All requirements are the same for ASC/ MSC Chain of Custody certificate holders except where stated. If, in the future, additional standard setters also use the MSC CoC requirements, this information will be published on the MSC website.

## Effective dates

The effective date for version 2.7 of the GCR is from 1 February 2025.

All Fishery CABs shall apply version 2.7 from this date. All CoC CABs shall apply version 2.7 from this date upon operation from the new MSC CoC scheme database.

All CABs may elect to use the GCR v2.7 as of the publication date (27 January 2025) if they are ready to do so.

Changes to the content of contracts (Section 4.8) are not required to be applied to existing issued documents, and relate only to the version issued after the 1 February 2025.

## Review

The MSC welcomes comments on this document. Comments will be considered as part of the next review process. Reviews will take place on regular basis (but not exceeding five years). Please submit comments to standards@msc.org.

More information about the MSC policy development process and the MSC Standard Setting Procedure can be found on the MSC website (msc.org).

## About this document

The  General  Certification  Requirements  (GCR)  for  Conformity  Assessment  Bodies  (CABs)  contain mandatory requirements for all CABs that carry out assessments and audits of fisheries or supply chain organisations who wish to make a claim that products they are selling are from well-managed and sustainable sources.

The following documents contain the mandatory requirements for CABs undertaking fisheries and/or Chain of Custody assessments and audits.

| Document                                        | Conformity                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MSC General Certification Requirements          | Mandatory for all CABs                                                                                                                                             |
| MSC Chain of Custody Certification Requirements | Mandatory  for  CABs  auditing  supply  chain  organisations                                                                                                       |
| MSC Fisheries Certification Process             | Mandatory for CABs assessing fisheries                                                                                                                             |
| MSC Labour Eligibility Requirements             | Mandatory  for  all  CABs  and  those  fisheries  and  supply  chain  organisations  that  are  seeking  MSC  Fisheries  and/or  Chain  of  Custody certification. |

## General Certification Requirements

The purposes of the MSC General Certification Requirements are to:

-  Establish a defined process that enables all CABs to operate in a consistent and controlled manner, and
-  Provide transparency to maintain credibility with stakeholders.

## Guidance

Guidance to the MSC General Certification Requirements has been produced to help CABs interpret the GCR.

Guidance that relates to a section or the content of a specific clause appears in a box at the end of the section or clause.

The  guidance  is  not  directly  auditable.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  guidance  included  in  this document will be applied by CABs where applicable unless there is a justification for not doing so.

## Derogations

Derogations  are  temporary  normative  measures  that  allow  for  an  MSC  requirement  to  be  applied differently  or  disregarded.  These are  provided  in  response to editorial errors, force  majeure, where intent is no longer fit for purpose and threatens MSC credibility or as a provision to test a policy change or  modify implementation timeframe when publishing a revised version of the normative document. Derogations are posted on a public log. The MSC requires CABs to follow relevant derogations.

## 3 Terms and definitions

Concepts, terms and phrases used are defined in the MSC-MSCI Vocabulary.

Concepts, terms or phrases used in the GCR that have more than 1 definition are defined within the text where such terms or phrases appear.

## 4 General requirements

## 4.1 Requirements of accreditation and approval

## Guidance 4.1

MSC appointed Assurance Services International (ASI) as sole global accreditation partner in 2008. From 2022, MSC has empowered ASI (as Assurance Provider) to assign accreditation services to Accreditation Bodies (ABs) which fulfil the ASI Partner AB selection criteria under the ASI Two-Tier Assurance Program. By transition to the Two-Tier program, and through partnering with ABs, ASI builds upon the existing accreditation infrastructure, leading to synergies and combined assessments. More information is available on the ASI website.

- 4.1.1 The CAB shall have had their application for accreditation, to the scope of the certification they wish to provide, accepted before starting to provide certification services.
- 4.1.2 The CAB shall only award certificates once they are accredited/approved and only within the scope of their accreditation.
- 4.1.3 The CAB shall recognise that certificate holders that have been certified by other CABs conform to relevant MSC Standards.
- 4.1.3.1 If  the  CAB  believes  a  certificate  issued  by  another  CAB  is  not  warranted,  they should write to the accreditation body and assurance provider detailing the casespecific circumstances.

## 4.2 Implications of suspension, withdrawal, or cancellation of CAB accreditation

- 4.2.1 The CAB shall not sign new certification contracts if its accreditation is suspended in full or in part and/or those requested activities are under the suspended scope.
- 4.2.2 The validity of certificates issued prior to the date of suspension by a suspended CAB is not affected, unless specified by the CAB or the accreditation body and assurance provider.

## 4.2.3 The CAB shall:

- a. Discuss with the accreditation body and/or assurance provider the resources (personnel and procedures) it requires to continue to provide surveillance audits during suspension and any conditions that may be placed upon its activities during this time.
- b. Ensure those resources are put into place.
- c. Request  the  written  approval  of  the  accreditation  body  and  assurance  provider  to continue to undertake surveillance audits.
- d. Undertake the surveillance audits in conformity with these requirements and any other requirements or conditions raised in 4.2.3.a.
- 4.2.4 In  the  event  of  suspension of accreditation, the CAB  shall  cooperate with the  MSC, the accreditation body and assurance provider to identify the reasons for the suspension, so that the accreditation body and assurance provider can determine if there are any reasons to doubt the integrity of any certificates issued by the CAB.

- 4.2.5 If there is no reason for the accreditation body and assurance provider to doubt the integrity of certificates issued by the CAB, the suspended CAB shall inform certificate holders within the scope of suspension that:
- a. The CAB's accreditation has been suspended.
- b. Their  certificate  shall  remain  valid  during  the  period  of  the  suspension,  subject  to requirements for continued certification.
- c. They  may  continue  to  make  claims  and  to  supply  certified  fish  under  the  normal conditions and obligations for certification.
- d. The CAB is required to take corrective action to reinstate its suspended accreditation.
- e. The corrective action taken may result in changes to the CAB's certification procedures or requirements.
- f. They may be involved in an ongoing partial or full re-audit if this is part of the CAB's corrective actions.

## Guidance 4.2.5.f

'Partial audits' refer to audits that are focused on the area of CAB non-conformance, which resulted in the suspension. For example, if the CAB non-conformance related to a lack of competency on management  system  auditing,  the  partial  audit  might  focus  on  the  management  system  of  the certificate holder.

- 4.2.5.1 The suspended CAB shall inform their certificate holders of the actual impact that the corrective action agreed with the accreditation body and assurance provider will have on each certificate holder, in which case the requirement in 4.2.5.d is waived.
- 4.2.6 The CAB shall suspend or withdraw any certificate with immediate effect as instructed by the accreditation body and/or assurance provider.
- 4.2.7 If 4.2.66 is applied, the suspended CAB shall advise the suspended certificate holders, in addition to the advice required to be provided by the CAB on suspension of a certificate (see 7.4), that:
- a. The CAB's accreditation has been suspended.
- b. They may no longer use the ecolabel,  logo,  or other  trademarks or make claims of certification.
- c. The CAB is required to take corrective action in relation to its accreditation.
- d. The corrective action taken may result in changes to the CAB's certification procedures or requirements.
- e. This may require them to be involved in an ongoing partial or full re-audit if this is part of the CAB's corrective actions.
- 4.2.8 The CAB may inform their suspended certificate holders of the actual impact that corrective action  agreed  with  the  accreditation  body  and/or  assurance  provider  will  have  on  each certificate holder.
- 4.2.8.1 If 4.2.8 applies, the requirement in 4.2.7.c is waived.
- 4.2.9 When a CAB's accreditation is withdrawn or cancelled, it shall not:
- a. Sign new certification contracts.
- b. Issue certificates.

## Guidance 4.2.9.b

Section 4.11 contains more information on what to do when a CAB's accreditation is withdrawn or cancelled. For instance, if a certificate holder's CAB has its accreditation withdrawn, they can transfer to another CAB as per 4.11.

## 4.3 Conformity with ISO 17065 and MSC requirements

- 4.3.1 The CAB shall conform to the requirements of ISO 17065 and all other MSC requirements relevant to the scope of accreditation applied for or held.
- 4.3.2 The CAB shall have a policy showing its support for the aims and objectives of the MSC.
- 4.3.2.1 The CAB's actions shall conform to the policy.
- 4.3.3 In  line  with  ISO  17065  4.6b,  the  CAB  shall  make  available  on  request  the  following information on the fees charged to clients:
- a. For CoC audits:
- i. The audit fee charged for single site audits.
- ii. Additional auditor time (applicable when the total audit time exceeds 1 day).
- iii. The certificate fee (for when any new certificates are issued).
- iv. Travel time to and from the audit.
- v. Travel expenses to and from the audit.
- vi. An additional note that group and CFO audits will be quoted on an individual basis.
- b. For fisheries assessments:
- i. An indicative average assessment personnel day rate.

## Guidance 4.3.3.b.i

For example, the CAB could calculate this using all fishery assessments carried out over the past year.

Per the MSC-MSCI Vocabulary, 'day' is defined as 'calendar day' in this document unless otherwise stated.

- ii. The criteria used for determining the cost of a fishery assessment, surveillance audit or re-assessment (such as fishery size, complexity, number of Units of Certification, number of target species, location, etc.).
- iii. Likely additional costs of predictable elements such as, report production and peer review.
- iv. An  explanation  of  how  subsistence,  travel  expenses  and  assessor  rates  are calculated on a per project basis.

## Guidance 4.3.3.b.iv

Examples of how these rates might be calculated are:

-  Expenses charged at actual cost without overheads, unless otherwise specified by the client.
-  The least expensive means of travel practicable should be used.
-  The  daily  assessment  fees  charged  to  the  client  are  based  on  the  rates  charged  by subcontracted assessors/auditors, and these rates vary regionally. When using subcontracted  assessors,  every  effort  is  made  to  use  assessors/auditors  geographically proximate to the location of the assessment to minimise excess travel costs and cost of living discrepancies between the assessors' home locations and the location of the assessment. Often, assessors from the developing world or areas distant from North America and Europe have lower rates, which can help to reduce assessment costs in those areas.
- 4.3.4 The CAB shall have processes in place to:

- a. Calculate individual quotes for specific CoC and fisheries clients in line with the criteria in 3.
- b. Clearly state all costs in advance of the client signing the fishery assessment or CoC audit contract.
- c. Explain to applicant fisheries clients the extent to which their information will be included in fisheries assessment reports, noting that the reports will be made publicly available

## Guidance 4.3.4

The intent of this requirement is that all costs are laid out as clearly as possible in advance of the client  signing  the  contract, in  line  with  the  criteria  listed  in  4.3.4.  This  includes  day  rates  for  any additional work that may be needed.

## 4.4 Conformity with ISO 19011

- 4.4.1 CAB audit and assessment personnel should follow guidance on auditing provided in ISO 19011.

## 4.5 Compliance with legal requirements

- 4.5.1 The CAB shall comply with the legal requirements in the countries in which it operates.
- 4.5.2 Key personnel shall show understanding of applicable legislation and regulations.

## 4.6 Certification decision-making entity

- 4.6.1 The  CAB's  decision-making  entity  shall  authorise  any  changes  to  the  conditions  of certification.

## 4.7 Communication with the MSC

- 4.7.1 The  CAB  shall  use  the  forms  and  methods  of  submission  of  information  and  data  as specified in this document.

## 4.8 Contract

- 4.8.1 The CAB shall have a signed legally-enforceable agreement for provision of assessment/audit activities to its clients, which may include the application form (ISO 17065 4.1.2).
- 4.8.1.1 If the client is a different legal entity to the certificate holder, the CAB shall have a written assessment/audit agreement with all parties.
- 4.8.2 Prior to entering into a contract, the CAB shall check the MSC website, scheme database or check with the applicant to verify that the applicant is not already certified.
- 4.8.2.1 If  the  applicant  is  already  certified  (including  a  certificate  status  of  cancelled, suspended or withdrawn), the CAB shall not enter into a contract for certification without following certificate transfer requirements set out in Section 4.11.
- 4.8.3 The CAB's contract shall specify a description of the steps that shall be taken by the client before it can be authorised by MSCI to use the trademarks.

## Guidance 4.8.3

The CAB may inform clients that if they have any questions concerning the ecolabel, logo, or other trademarks, they should contact MSCI: ecolabel@msc.org.

- 4.8.4 The CAB shall have procedures in place to ensure that applicants for certification are fully informed  of,  and  have  contractually  agreed  in  writing  to,  the  assurance  body's  right  to publish CAB assessment reports on their website. These reports may include references to applicants and certificate holders.
- 4.8.5 The  CAB's  contract  shall  specify  that  data  and  information  regarding  applicants  and certificate holders shall be shared by the CAB with the MSC (and ASC where applicable) and made public, as indicated in the applicable MSC Certification Program Documents.

## Contract with CoC clients

- 4.8.6 Where  2  or  more  legal  entities  apply  for  a  certificate,  the  CAB  shall  sign  a  legallyenforceable agreement for provision of assessment/audit activities with all legal entities.
- 4.8.7 The CAB's contract with CoC clients shall specify the following:
- a. The client is required to conform to the relevant MSC CoC Standard and applicable Certification Program Documents. .
- b. To be eligible to be audited and certified to the MSC's CoC Standard the client must meet the eligibility requirements prescribed in the MSC Labour Eligibility Requirements.
- c. The CAB shall suspend or withdraw certification as per Section 7.4.
- d. The client shall provide information requested to assist in  traceability or supply chain assurance exercises conducted by the MSC or its designated agents.

## Guidance 4.8.7.d

A traceability assurance exercise aims to trace certified products through the supply chain back to the certified fishery or farm of origin by reviewing traceability documents and/or sales and purchase records of certified products.

- 'Designated  agents'  are  MSC  nominated  organisations  that  may  include  representatives  from scheme owners such as the ASC, or from the MSC's assurance provider.
- i. If  the  MSC  or  its  designated  agent's  request  to  the  client  to  submit  records  of certified material are not met within the specified timeframe, a request for action may be sent to the CAB by the MSC.
- A. Within 15 days of receiving the request, the CAB shall work with the client, at the client's expense, to verify that the information is present and send a copy of the requested information to the MSC or its designated agents.
- B. If the information has not been provided to the MSC or its designated agents within the 15-day period, the CAB shall raise a major non-conformity and, if this is  not  closed  out  within  a  further  15  days,  suspension  and/or  withdrawal  of certification shall follow as per Section 7.4.
- C. Following any actions by the CAB regarding non-provision of information for tracebacks  or  supply  chain  reconciliations,  the  CAB  shall  undertake  a  risk analysis, which may lead to additional auditing.
- e. If inconsistencies in records need to be verified, the client shall provide to the MSC or its designated agents, upon request, purchase and/or sale records for certified products that will be shared with the CAB of their immediate supplier or customer.

## Guidance 4.8.7.e

Financial information can be removed and these records will remain confidential to the client's CAB, the  MSC,  the  supplier  or  customer's  CAB,  the  accreditation  body  and  the  assurance  provider. Records of sales to the final consumer will not be requested.

- f. The client shall accept expedited audits, including unannounced audits, from their CAB and assurance provider.

- i. In  the  case  of  an  unannounced  audit,  the  client  shall  provide  access  to  the applicable operating site(s) in scope within 30 minutes of the auditor's arrival.
- g. The client agrees to allow samples of seafood to be taken from their operation by the MSC or its designated agents, or the CAB, when requested for the purposes of product authentication or conformity testing.
- i. All individual product authentication test results relating to samples taken at a client site are confidential between the client, the CAB, and the MSC and its designated agents,  and  shall  only  be  communicated  to  other  parties  in  anonymised  and aggregated form.

## Guidance 4.8.7.g.i

The amount of product required for the sample is very small (generally less than 100g) and, in many cases, may only be a swab from the fish. However, it is recognised that if a small business is handling high value products and these are damaged by sampling, the loss may need to be reimbursed. For ASC sampling, the  amount may be more, such as 500g, for which payment would be made as appropriate.

The CAB should contact the MSC if it considers that a client should be compensated by the MSC for sample collection, with a justification based on the relative value of the sample to the client, taking into account both client size and lost product value.

Where a product authentication test indicates that the seafood presents a food safety risk (e.g. a species  is  not  fit  for  human  consumption or  contains  banned  substances),  then  there  is  a  legal obligation to inform the authorities. In this case the CAB could request the certificate holder to inform the authorities and provide evidence to them of having done this.

Designated agents may include representatives from other scheme owners, such as ASC, or from MSC's assurance provider.

- h. For clients handling seaweed, the client shall sign the Seaweed Partnership Agreement before certification can be granted.

## Contract with fisheries clients

- 4.8.8. The CAB's contract with fishery clients shall state that:
- a. The client is required to conform to the MSC Fisheries Standard and applicable MSC Certification Program Documents.
- b. If a fishery certificate is to be shared, the fishery client shall specify the steps that shall be taken for members of the client group to be able to sell the product as certified.
- c. To be eligible to be assessed and certified to the MSC's Fishery Standard, the client must  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  prescribed  in  the  MSC  Labour  Eligibility Requirements.
- d. The client is responsible to demonstrate that the fishery has systems of tracking and tracing to ensure all fish and fish products identified and sold as certified by the fishery client originate from the individual unit of certification.
- e. Chain of Custody certification may be required at an earlier stage than the change of ownership (e.g. catch or transport vessels, offloading at sea/on land, auction) to any party not covered by the fishery certificate.

## Guidance 4.8.8.e

The intent of this  clause  is  to  make  clear  that  the  CAB  may  require  that  vessels  are  separately certified for Chain of Custody. Inserting this clause into the certification contract removes any doubt that may arise at a later stage that vessel and/or fishery client member's CoC would automatically be included under the fishery certificate.

- f. The client shall provide traceability records requested to assist in traceability assurance exercises  or  supply  chain  reconciliations  as  conducted  by  the  MSC  or  the  MSC's designated agents.

## 4.9 Control of certified trademarks and CAB logo claims

- 4.9.1 The MSC ecolabel, the name 'Marine Stewardship Council' and the acronym 'MSC' are trademarks that are owned by the Marine Stewardship Council.
- 4.9.2 The ASC logo, the name 'Aquaculture Stewardship Council' and the acronym 'ASC' are trademarks that are owned the by Aquaculture Stewardship Council.
- 4.9.3 Any party wishing to use any of these trademarks on any materials that will be seen by consumers (or business customers for promotional purposes) shall hold a licence to do so from MSCI.
- 4.9.3.1 The acronyms 'MSC' and 'ASC' and names 'Marine Stewardship Council' and 'Aquaculture Stewardship Council' may be used without a licence from MSCI only in  a  business-to-business,  non-consumer  facing  context  (e.g.  certified  product production  and  storage)  and  only  for  product  identification  or  employee  training purposes.
- 4.9.3.2 Applicants  for  certification  may  use  the  name  'Marine  Stewardship  Council'  or 'Aquaculture  Stewardship  Council'  and  the  acronym  'MSC'  or  'ASC'  to  inform stakeholders about the assessment or audit process and invite participation, without having a licence agreement.
- 4.9.3.3 If there is any doubt about whether a licence is required, the CAB shall refer to MSCI for advice.
- 4.9.4 Any party intending to handle  ASC-MSC seaweed shall  ensure a Seaweed Partnership Agreement is in place before any use of these trademarks, including for use in a businessto-business, non-consumer facing context.
- 4.9.5 The CAB shall verify  if  an  applicant  has  used  the  trademarks  without  a  licence  or  sold products as certified prior to being certified.
- 4.9.5.1 If  the  applicant  has  used  the  trademarks  without  a  licence  agreement  or  sold products as certified prior to being certified, the CAB shall raise a non-conformity, and instruct the applicant to immediately cease use of the trademarks and selling products as certified.
- 4.9.5.2 A copy of the non-conformity shall be sent to MSCI  within 7 days via ecolabel@msc.org.
- 4.9.6 The CAB shall have documented procedures for the issue and use of any logo or trademark of  the  CAB  (ISO  17065  4.1.3,  7.9.3  and  7.9.4)  for  the  certification  program,  including procedures for pre-publication review and authorisation by the CAB of:
- a. All uses of the CAB's logo by certificate holders.
- b. All public claims made by certificate holders referring to their certification.

## 4.10 Language

- 4.10.1 The official language of the MSC is English.
- 4.10.2 The CAB shall note that the MSC may request that all reports and annexes to reports be translated into English.
- 4.10.3 The CAB shall allow for the time and costs of translations that may be required.

## 4.11 Transfer of a certificate between CABs

## Guidance 4.11

A client may request to change CABs due to:

-  The client's choice, or
-  The failure of an applicant CAB to gain accreditation for the scope of the certification and hence not being able to issue a certificate, orA CAB ceasing to offer accredited certification services for any reason.

The MSC will  only  recognise  1  certificate  for  the  stated  scope  (combination  of  fishery  and  CoC activity) for the client at any one time. The certificate code that is assigned to the client per Section 7.5 will remain the same regardless of changing CABs.

- 4.11.1 CABs shall respect a client's request to change their CAB, either prior to or after the issue of a certificate.
- 4.11.2 If a certificate holder wishes to change CABs, the succeeding CAB and the current CAB shall work together where practicable, and as required throughout this section, to exchange information about the certification.

## Transfer of a certificate from an accredited CAB

- 4.11.3 When an application for transfer from a certificate holder who holds a certificate with an accredited CAB is received, the succeeding CAB shall:
- a. Confirm  with  the  certificate  holder  whether they  or  the  current  CAB  will  provide  the information required for the transfer.
- b. For CoC, receive a written non-disclosure agreement  waiver from the certificate holder or have a non-disclosure agreement in place, to provide permission for the succeeding CAB to receive CoC certificate holder's data from the current CAB.

## Guidance 4.11.3.a

The need for a non-disclosure agreement is to receive written agreement or a waiver from the client for any organisational and personal data to be disclosed to a possible succeeding CAB, whether or not a client contract has been established, to address the general data protection regulation (GDPR) obligations.

- c. Inform the certificate holder that the MSC will only recognise the current certificate and its status of valid, cancelled, suspended or withdrawn until such time as the current CAB changes the certification status in the MSC scheme database.
- d. Record the transfer request.
- e. Review the reasons for the requested transfer.
- 4.11.4 Request from the certificate holder or current CAB:
- a. The latest audit report (for a CoC client).
- b. Any relevant information to demonstrate, such as:
- i. The  certificate  holder's  activities  are  within  the  scope  of  the  succeeding  CAB's accreditation.
- ii. The certificate is valid (authenticity, duration, scope).
- iii. The status of outstanding non-conformities and corrective actions or conditions is known.
- iv. Any information impacting the integrity of a client's certification is known; including but not limited to suspensions, withdrawals, complaints and reported Conflicts of Interest of assessors and auditors.

- v. Consideration is given to assessment, audit and surveillance reports, and any nonconformities or conditions arising from them.
- vi. Any complaints received and actions taken to address complaints are known.
- vii.  The stage in the current certification cycle is known.
- viii. Any other relevant documentation provided is reviewed.
- ix. The results of any assurance body assessment regarding the conformance of the certificate holder to certification requirements shall be applicable to the succeeding CAB.
- 4.11.5 The succeeding CAB shall conduct a pre-transfer review of the information provided.

## Guidance 4.11.5

For CoC, a pre-transfer review is required only if there are audit records within the last 3 years.

- 4.11.6 If  the  succeeding CAB is satisfied that the certificate holder has provided all information needed to approve the transfer, the succeeding CAB shall:
- a. Confirm provisional approval of the transfer to the certificate holder.
- b. Agree the approach for contacting the current CAB.
- c. For  CoC,  have  a  non-disclosure  agreement  or  receive  a  written  non-disclosure agreement waiver, if not previously achieved as per 4.11.3.b.
- d. Inform the current CAB that the transfer has been provisionally accepted, if relevant.
- e. Request any information from the current CAB that the succeeding CAB believes may be pertinent to MSC certification.
- 4.11.7 If the certificate holder has attempted to provide the information needed and the succeeding CAB requires more to approve the transfer, the succeeding CAB shall request the certificate holder's approval to request the information from the current CAB.
- a. If the certificate holder does not approve per 4.11.6 and cannot provide the information, the succeeding CAB shall decline the transfer.
- b. If the certificate holder approves per 4.11.6, the succeeding CAB shall:
- i. Inform the current CAB of the request to transfer.
- ii. Inform the current CAB what information they already have.
- iii. Request that the current CAB provide information the certificate holder was unable to provide and any additional information they believe the succeeding CAB should be aware of regarding the integrity of the certificate.
- 4.11.8 The current CAB shall provide any information requested within 10 days of receiving the request,  including  all  information  that  has,  or  may  have,  a  bearing  on  determining  the certificate holder's conformity with the relevant MSC Standard(s).
- 4.11.9 Depending on the findings from the pre-transfer review, the succeeding CAB shall:
- a. Decline the transfer, or
- b. Propose to accept the transfer and:
- i. Treat the certificate holder as a new client and conduct a full assessment or audit, or
- ii. Conduct  a  partial  on-site  or  remote  assessment/audit,  focussing  on  identified problem areas and/or on areas where information is deficient, or
- iii. If no risks are identified during the pre-transfer review, continue with the certificate holder's existing surveillance program, or
- iv. If  the certificate is suspended, follow any remaining suspension requirements for the certificate holder, as in 7.4.4-9 for fishery clients and 7.4.16-19 for CoC clients.

- 4.11.10 Any action(s) proposed in 4.11.6 and the reasons for taking them shall be explained to the certificate holder, who shall be given an option to accept or reject the proposed action(s) and to decide whether to proceed with the transfer.
- 4.11.11 Acceptance of proposed actions:
- a. If the certificate holder accepts the proposed actions, the succeeding CAB shall instruct the certificate holder to write to their current CAB to confirm the intent to transfer.
- b. If the certificate holder does not accept the proposed actions, the succeeding CAB shall advise the certificate holder and the current CAB that the transfer is declined.
- 4.11.12 The succeeding CAB shall contact the current CAB and client to agree on the transfer date (the 'agreed transfer date') on which all rights and obligations for maintaining the certificate will pass from the current CAB to the succeeding CAB.
- a. The current CAB shall facilitate record transfers for their clients, including those with cancelled/ withdrawn certificate status, even if a valid client contract may no longer be in place.
- 4.11.13 The succeeding CAB shall inform the MSC of the agreed transfer date at least 10 days in advance of the agreed transfer date.
- 4.11.14 On the agreed transfer date, the current CAB shall:
- a. Cancel the certificate in the scheme database.

## Guidance 4.11.14.a

The certificate is not to be cancelled by the current CAB before the agreed transfer date, as this can leave the client without a valid certificate.

If the succeeding CAB cancels the certificate at this point in the process, after the agreed transfer date,  the client will not be able to make any claims of certification until they are re-certified by a different CAB.

- b. Ensure that all the client's records are up to date on the scheme database 1 .
- 4.11.15 The succeeding CAB shall issue the new certificate in the scheme database before or on the agreed transfer date, ensuring no gap in certification.
- 4.11.16 If the transfer is undertaken, then:
- a. The expiry date of the succeeding CAB's certificate shall be the same as the expiry date of the preceding CAB's certificate.
- b. All  conditions  and/or  non-conformities  raised  by  the  preceding  CAB  shall  remain applicable, unless they are closed or revised as a result of an on-site assessment or audit by the succeeding CAB. The actions taken shall be justified,documented and in conformity with the FCP or CoCCR.

With the transition of MSC CoC scheme databases from Ecert to the new CoC Audit Platform, CABs are given a data correctness concession until 31 December 2024 which acknowledges scheme database differences. The objective of this concession is, upon adoption (including early adoption) of the new MSC scheme database, to have all  CoC  client  data  accurately  checked  and  completed  by  CABs  on  the  new  scheme  database  within  this concessioned period. All client data shall be correct for each certificate holder by the completion of their first audit in the new scheme database or sooner in case of scope change requests; this includes the accurate population of new data fields present in the new MSC scheme database that were not previously included on Ecert. Any reported changes by clients (such as certificate holder contact details, scope changes and/or extensions) are to be updated upon receipt directly in the new MSC scheme database, in line with MSC certification requirements. This data concession is to be applied once only.

- c. The surveillance audit plan set by the preceding CAB shall be followed (or following documentation of justification for change), revised and agreed with the client by the succeeding CAB, and in conformity with the FCP or CoCCR.
- i. Any changes to a fishery's  surveillance  schedule  shall  be  communicated  to  the MSC at least 30 days in advance of a scheduled surveillance audit.
- 4.11.17 For transfers other than those between accredited CABs, CABs shall follow the process described in section 4.11 to ensure conformance with the MSC Standards. These cases include but are not limited to:
- a. Transfer from an accredited CAB during an initial assessment or audit process.
- b. Transfer from an accredited CAB during a fishery re-assessment process.
- c. Transfer from an applicant CAB.
- d. Transfer from a CAB whose accreditation has been suspended.
- e. Transfer from a CAB whose accreditation has been withdrawn or voluntarily ceases to be accredited (cancellation).

## 4.12 Variation requests

- 4.12.1 To submit a variation request to the GCR, CoCCR, FCP, or any of the MSC Standards, the CAB shall apply using the 'MSC Variation Request Form' and:
- a. Specify which clause of the MSC requirements a variation is applied for.
- b. Provide a justification for the variation that addresses each of the criteria (if any) for accepting the variation request (where specified in relevant requirement clauses).
- c. Explain  how  the  variation  request  does  not  alter  the  conformity  of  the  applicant  or certificate holder with the relevant MSC standard.
- d. Submit the 'MSC Variation Request Form' to the relevant MSC program:
- i. CoC Program variations via email to supplychain@msc.org.
- ii. Fisheries Program variations via the MSC scheme database.
- 4.12.2 When submitting a variation request as allowed under these requirements, the CAB shall note that:
- a. The decision to accept or decline a variation request is usually made by the MSC within 14 days of receipt of the request.
- b. The CAB shall ensure that the conditions set by the MSC when a variation request is accepted are met.
- c. The  CAB  shall  only  submit  variation  requests  in  advance  of  the  circumstances occurring. The MSC will not accept retrospective variation requests.
- 4.12.3 The  CAB  shall  keep  records  of  all  variation  requests  it  has  submitted  and  the  MSC's responses.

## For fisheries variations

- 4.12.4 The CAB shall note that the MSC will post variation requests and responses on the MSC website.
- 4.12.5 If the CAB becomes aware that it has not followed the MSC requirement(s), the CAB shall create an advisory for stakeholders and:
- a. Upload the advisory to the scheme database for publication on the MSC website, and
- b. Send the advisory to the assurance provider.

## 5 Structural requirements

## 5.1 Mechanism for safeguarding impartiality

- 5.1.1 The CAB shall establish a mechanism for safeguarding impartiality in line with ISO 17065 5.2.
- 5.1.2 The mechanism shall conduct a detailed review of the impartiality of the assessment, audit, certification and decision-making processes of the CAB at least annually.:
- 5.1.3 The mechanism's review, their communication to the CAB's top management, and the CAB top management's reasoning behind any subsequent decision relating to the committee's activities, shall be documented and made available for review by the accreditation body and assurance provider.

## Guidance 5.1.3

The CAB is required to manage impartiality on an ongoing basis through adherence to ISO 17065 (Sections 4.2 and 5.2), which should pick up instances where an assessment team was not impartial. Where this occurs, the impartiality mechanism should be notified as specified in ISO 17065 4.2.2 and provide inputs  on  these issues (ISO 17065 5.2.1 c). On occasion,  it may be that the impartiality mechanism finds that an assessment team is not impartial where this has not been identified by the CAB's own impartiality review processes, in which case the MSC would expect to see this information provided to the CAB and appropriate follow-up action taken as part of the management review, as required in ISO 17065 8.5.2 and 8.5.3. While this may occur sometime after the assessment has taken place, such a finding by the impartiality committee will allow the CAB to take corrective actions to ensure there is no repeat in the future.

- 5.1.4 For a CAB accredited for MSC Fisheries certification, the impartiality mechanism shall, as part  of  the  impartiality  review,  consider  all  instances  where  the  CAB  has  undertaken consultation work and related MSC assessments.

## Guidance 5.1.4

The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the CAB's impartiality procedures are robust, where the CAB has undertaken both the MSC fishery pre-assessment and full assessment of the same fishery. It is particularly important to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest involved between the personnel involved in the pre- and full assessments, in line with the requirements of ISO 17065. The  CAB  impartiality  committee  is  therefore  required  to  satisfy  themselves  that  both  the  preassessment and full assessment were carried out in an appropriate impartial and objective way.

## 5.2 Confidentiality

- 5.2.1 In addition to ISO 17065, specific requirements on confidentiality are detailed in the FCP (4.3 and 4.5) and in the CoCCR (8.2.2.g and 8.3.1.g).

## Guidance 5.2.1

When undertaking its work, the CAB has access to commercially sensitive information. The MSC believes that a policy and instruction on confidentiality needs to be documented to:

-  Ensure the CAB considers all aspects of confidentiality.
-  Allow the accreditation body and assurance provider to review the policy and subsequent procedures for completeness.

## 6 Resource requirements

## 6.1 Personnel

- 6.1.1 The CAB shall ensure that all CoC auditors, Group CoC central office auditors, fishery team leaders  and  assessment  team  members  conform  to  the  competency  and  qualification criteria listed in CoCCR Section 5 and Annex PC of the FCP, as appropriate for CoC audits, Group CoC audits and fishery assessments.
- 6.1.2 The  CAB  shall  use  1  or  more  of  the  verification  mechanisms  in  each  qualification  and competency criterion listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the CoCCR and Tables PC1, PC2 and PC3 of the FCP to verify that all CoC auditors, fishery team leaders and team members comply with the qualification and competency criteria.
- 6.1.2.1 For the MSC training courses, the pass mark in examinations shall be 70% for CoC auditors and fishery team leaders and members.
- 6.1.2.2 If any CoC auditors, fishery team leaders or members fail to obtain the pass mark for a training course after 3 attempts, the CAB or trainee (if not affiliated with a CAB) shall contact the MSC to agree on a training action plan.

## 6.1.3 The CAB shall ensure that:

- a. All CoC auditors have the qualifications and competencies detailed in Table 1 below in addition to those listed in Table 1 in the CoCCR.
- b. All fishery team leaders have the qualifications and competencies detailed in Table 1 below, in addition to those listed in Table PC1 in the FCP.
- c. Fishery  team  leaders  mentor  and/or  train  all  fisheries team  members  in  their assessment teams to ensure they are familiar with third-party management system and conformity assessment auditing techniques.

## Guidance 6.1.3.c

Fishery team leader activities for mentoring and/or training of their fishery team members should ensure  that  all  such  team  members  are  familiar  with  the  key  concepts  of  third-party  auditing techniques in advance of conducting any fishery assessments. Evidence will be expected to show how the  CAB has actively  ensured such familiarity  on  a  timely  basis,  as  needed  for  each  team member. This should involve:

-  Initial training inputs from the team leader on auditing techniques for new auditors, based on ISO 19011, particularly Section 6 (Performing an audit) and Annex B (Additional guidance for auditors planning and conducting audits).
-  The opportunity for the team leader to review and provide feedback on the performance of their team members.

## Third-party product and management system conformity assessment auditing techniques

- d. The ability to manage a fisheries assessment or CoC audit team in accordance with MSC requirements.

## Verification mechanisms

- a. Certificate of passing auditor training course delivered by a provider recognised by a reputable auditor registration organisation (e.g. by CQI/IRCA, Exemplar Global Approved/recognised training provider).

## Guidance

Additional verification evidence may include:

-  Fisheries assessment and/or CoC audit reports.
-  Witness  or  office  audits  by  an  MSC-appointed  accreditation  body  and assurance provider, CAB on-site observations, review of fishery assessment and/or feedback from clients.

## Guidance 6.1.4

For fishery reviewers and decision-makers, the CAB is reminded that the criteria of ISO 17065 6.1.2.1 will  apply.  The  CAB  will  still  have  to  demonstrate  that  the  reviewer  and/or  decision-maker  is competent. One way of demonstrating this competence would be for the reviewer and/or decisionmaker to pass the online training module for fishery team leaders.

- 6.1.4.1 For CoC audits against the CoC Default Standard or the CoC CFO Standard, the reviewer shall be a qualified CoC auditor (see 6.1.2 and CoCCR Section 5.1).
- 6.1.4.2 For Group CoC audits, the reviewer shall be a qualified Group CoC auditor (see 6.1.2 and CoCCR Section 5.1).

- 6.1.5.1 The  CAB  shall  have  documented  procedures  and  criteria  for  monitoring  and measuring the performance of all persons involved, based on the frequency of their usage and the level of risk linked to their activities.
- 6.1.5.2 The CAB shall review the competence of its personnel in light of their performance, in order to identify training needs.

## 6.2 Contract with personnel

- 6.2.1 The CAB shall have documented procedures for reviewing and determining a timely and appropriate response to any declaration of potential conflict of interest.
- 6.2.1.1 These  procedures  shall  ensure  that  the  declared  actual  or  potential  conflict  of interest neither influences nor is perceived to influence the evaluations, actions and decisions of the CAB.
- 6.2.2 The CAB shall retain records of its reasoning behind any decisions, including all actions that have been taken to resolve either the possible or actual conflict of interest.

## 7 Process requirements

## 7.1 Information for applicants

- f. Relevant MSC Certification Program Documents.

## 7.2 Assessment and audit planning

- 7.2.1 The CAB shall provide a plan for each fishery or CoC assessment or audit (ISO 17065 7.4.1) to all personnel involved in the assessment or audit prior to commencing work. The plan shall (as relevant):
- a. Be individually tailored to each assessment or audit.
- b. Specify division of responsibilities between team members.
- c. Nominate  a  team  leader  responsible  for  conducting  the  assessment  or  audit  in conformity to MSC requirements and good audit practice.
- d. Set  out  processes  to  be  undertaken  by  team  members  prior  to  and  during  the assessment or audit (including consultations with stakeholders, where undertaken).
- 7.2.2 To ensure that an applicant has sufficient information to reach a common understanding with the CAB prior to commencing the assessment or audit (ISO 17065 7.3.1 b), the CAB shall ensure that before the end of the planning phase the applicant receives the following written information:
- a. Expected scope of the assessment or audit.
- b. Draft work schedule.
- c. Nature of stakeholder consultation, if any.
- d. Names and affiliations of proposed team members and/or auditor(s).

- 7.3.2.1 The  CAB  shall  include  any  summary  of  changes  provided  by  the  MSC  in  this communication.

## 7.4 Suspension or withdrawal of certification

- 7.4.1 A CAB may suspend or cancel a certificate for a contractual or administrative reason.

## Guidance 7.4.1

Examples  of  cases  where  a  CAB  may  suspend  or  cancel  a  certificate  for  a  contractual  or administrative reason include:

-  Late payment of CAB invoices.
-  Delay in the audit schedule due to unforeseen circumstances.
- 7.4.1.1 In these cases, only 7.4.4, 7.4.5.a, 7.4.6, and 7.4.7 shall apply for fishery clients, and only 7.4.16b and 7.4.17a shall apply for CoC clients.
- 7.4.2 A  CAB  shall,  if  notified  by  the  MSC,  follow  the  process  set  out  in  the  MSC  Rules  on Unacceptable Conduct.

## Fishery certificate suspension

- 7.4.3 A CAB shall suspend a fishery certificate if a client:
- a. No longer conforms to the MSC Fisheries Standard, or
- b. Has not made adequate progress towards meeting conditions, or
- c. Does not provide information to allow verification that conditions are being addressed, or

- d. Does not agree to allow the CAB to hold a surveillance audit as required in FCP v2.2 7.28/FCP v3.0 7.29, or
- e. Does not provide information requested by the CAB within 90 days of being requested to do so, or

## Guidance 7.4.3.e

The certificate holder may be notified of the 90-day notice period in reports, requests for action or other documents provided by the CAB to the certificate holder.

- f. Requests to enter a period of self-suspension, or
- g. Includes an entity that does not meet MSC's Labour Eligibility Requirements.
- 7.4.3.1 In the case of self-suspension, 7.4.4.e does not apply.
- 7.4.4 If  a  fishery  certificate  is  suspended,  the  CAB  shall  set  the  effective  date  for  the  fishery certificate suspension 30 days after the CAB's decision to suspend, and:
- a. Inform the client and the MSC of the suspension.
- b. Announce the suspension by completing and uploading the 'MSC Notice of Suspension Template' to the scheme database, to be published on the MSC website.

## Guidance 7.4.4.b

The Notice of Suspension contains the date of suspension (30 days from the CAB's decision to suspend),  the  clause(s)  against  which  the  suspension  is  based  (i.e.  includes  the  information reviewed) and the performance indicators affected.

The intention of introducing a 30-day notice period is to allow time for supply chains to prepare before a suspension comes into effect. The Notice of Suspension should be published on the MSC website as soon as the CAB confirms there is cause for suspension.

- c. Confirm the client's ability to segregate fish based on the date of capture.

## Guidance 7.4.4.c

The client should have a system in place to segregate fish based on the date of capture. The system could be a physical labelling on product stating the date of capture or other record showing the date of capture of the fish.

- d. Instruct the client:
- i. Not to sell any fish caught on or after the date of suspension as MSC certified. Fish caught prior to the date of suspension may continue to be sold after the date of suspension as MSC certified if the CAB confirms the client's ability to segregate fish based on the date of capture (in conformance with 7.4.3.c).

## Guidance 7.4.4.d.i

There needs to be a difference in treatment of fish captured before and after the date of suspension.

The burden of proof that fish can be separated by capture date falls on the certificate holder or logo licensee. If there is no objective evidence of the ability to separate fish by capture date, the fish cannot be sold as certified.

- ii. To advise client group members of the suspension (if relevant).
- iii. To advise existing customers of the suspension in writing within 4 days of the Notice of Suspension.
- iv. To keep records of advice to customers.
- v. Not to make any claims of MSC certification on or after the date of suspension.

## Guidance 7.4.4.d.v

If  a  certificate  is  suspended, the provisions for MSC ecolabel use, claims, etc. in the case that a certificate is suspended or withdrawn shall apply. The continued use of the MSC ecolabel and other claims of conformity with the MSC Standards is not permitted, and the client's name will be removed from the MSC website or their status will be updated as appropriate.

- e. To provide a documented corrective action plan for addressing the cause of suspension, which is acceptable to the CAB, within 90 days from the date the Notice of Suspension is published on the MSC website.
- f. The corrective action plan shall include a binding timeframe.
- g. If the client submits an acceptable corrective action plan within 90 days:
- i. Instruct the client to implement the corrective action plan.
- ii. Upload to the scheme database to be published on the MSC website:
- A. A statement confirming their acceptance of the corrective action plan.
- B. The client's corrective action plan.
- h. If  the client does not submit an acceptable corrective action plan within 90 days, the CAB shall withdraw the certificate.
- 7.4.5 On the date of suspension, the CAB shall:
- a. Record the decision on the scheme database.
- b. Suspend the certificate until the cause of the suspension has been fully addressed.
- c. Verify  the  effectiveness  of  the  corrective  action,  once  informed  by  the  client  of  its completion.

## Guidance 7.4.5.c

Verification activities could form part of the annual surveillance audit, an expedited audit or a review of information.

- 7.4.6 When the CAB has verified that the fishery client has addressed the reason for suspension, the CAB shall:
- a. Reinstate the certificate.
- b. Produce a report documenting the following:
- i. Evidence  that  describes  how  the  cause  of  suspension  has  been  satisfactorily addressed.
- ii. A statement confirming the reinstatement of the certificate.

## Guidance 7.4.6.b.ii

Surveillance Audits are not required under suspension. Prior to reinstating a fishery certificate, the CAB should ensure the fishery  client  remains  in  conformance  with  surveillance  audit  timing  and progress on conditions. In such cases, the certificate duration remains 5 years (i.e. no extension is added for suspension).

For example, in the case of a self-suspension, a fishery client is certified in August 2010. In August 2012 (second year), the client requests to suspend the fishery certificate. In August 2013 (third year), the client requests to reinstate the fishery certificate. At this time the CAB would hold a surveillance audit in conformance with FCP v2.2 7.28/FCP v3.0 7.29 (or an expedited audit if at another time of year) to assess the client's progress against both the second and third annual audit milestones. The CAB would then produce a surveillance report that conforms to both GCR 7.4.6.b and FCP v2.2 7.28.19-23/FCP  v3.0  7.28.19-23.  The  certificate  expiration  date  remains  5  years  from  the certification date (i.e. August 2015).

- 7.4.7 If a suspended fishery certificate is reinstated, the CAB shall:
- a. Record the decision on the scheme database.
- b. Upload a report in conformance with 7.4.6.b to the scheme database to be published on the MSC website.
- 7.4.8 The CAB shall withdraw the certificate if verification of the effectiveness of the corrective actions  to  address  the  reason(s)  for  suspension  in  the  required  timeframe  cannot  be conducted.

## Guidance 7.4.8

Suspension should normally precede withdrawal of a certificate. When a certificate is withdrawn, the CAB may no longer be in a contractual agreement with the client.

A suspension preceding withdrawal is not required in the case when a fishery client elects to withdraw the certificate.

- 7.4.9 If a certificate is withdrawn, the CAB shall record its decision on the scheme database on the date of withdrawal, and:
- a. Upload an announcement of withdrawal to the scheme database to be published on the MSC website.
- b. Instruct the client to advise existing customers in writing of the certificate withdrawal within 4 days of the withdrawal.
- c. Instruct the client not to sell any fish caught on or after the date of withdrawal as MSC certified.
- d. Fish caught prior to the date of withdrawal may continue to be sold after the date of withdrawal as MSC certified if the CAB confirms the client's ability to segregate fish based on date of capture in conformance with 7.4.4.c.
- e. Instruct the client not to make any claims of MSC certification on or after the date of withdrawal.

## Guidance 7.4.9

If a fishery certificate is withdrawn, the client may re-apply for certification as per the FCP.

## CoC certificate suspension

- 7.4.10 The CAB shall suspend a CoC certificate if any of the following occur:
- a. There has been a demonstrable breakdown in the Chain of Custody caused by the client's actions or inaction.

## Guidance 7.4.10.a

Examples of a demonstrable breakdown in the Chain of Custody are:

-  Significant discrepancies in records supplied at different points in time by the client.
-  Significant omissions in the client's traceability records for certified products.
- b. The client has sold products as certified (or under-assessment), which are shown not to be certified (or under-assessment), except for the following cases:
- i. The  CAB shall  not  suspend  a  CoC  CFO  certificate  if  the  conditions  of  CoCCR 9.2.2.a are met.
- ii. The CAB shall not suspend an entire CoC Group certificate if the requirements in CoCCR 9.4.4.a or 9.4.6.1.a are met.

## Guidance 7.4.10.b

The labelling or identification  of  fish  products  as  'certified'  which  in  fact  did  not  originate  from  a certified fishery or farm is a serious breach of the Chain of Custody. Evidence suggesting mislabelling of certified products can come from the CAB, the MSC or the assurance provider but will need to be substantiated by  the  CAB.  The  MSC  requires  positive  evidence  of  conformance  in  cases  where mislabelling is suspected; the absence of evidence is not sufficient to maintain certification.

The only instances where a certificate would not be automatically suspended due to a case of noncertified  product  sold  as  certified  are  specific  cases  relating  to  self-reported  mislabelling  or  nonconforming product (7.4.14.2) and for CFO clients and group clients, as per 7.4.10b.i-ii.

- c. The client  cannot  demonstrate  that  products  labelled  or  sold  as  certified  are  in  fact certified.
- d. The client has not satisfactorily addressed any major non-conformity within the specified timeframe.
- e. For CoC Group clients:
- i. The client has had a group critical non-conformity raised, or
- ii. The number of sites, where 1 or more site major non-conformities raised, meets or exceeds the reject number shown in CoCCR Table 10, or
- iii. There are more than 4 group major non-conformities raised during any 1 audit.
- f. For  CoC  CFO  clients,  the  client  has  exceeded  the  reject  number  of  major  nonconformities as described in CoCCR 9.3.1.

## Guidance 7.4.10.e-f

For CoC Group and multi-site CFO, a stratum or entire certificate suspension is triggered as soon as the first reason for suspension is detected. For example, at a surveillance audit, the CAB makes a judgement whether to suspend the stratum or the entire certificate when reason for suspension is found at a specific site before completing the full audit sample.

- g. For CoC CFO clients, the client has an additional major non-conformity raised against the  same  clause  in  the  CoC  CFO  Standard at  a  follow-up  site  visit  as  described  in CoCCR 9.3.2.3.
- h. The client does not agree to allow the CAB to hold an audit within the required timeframe specified in the CoCCR 11.3.1 for surveillance and CoCCR 11.4.1 for recertification.

## Guidance 7.4.10.h

This could be due to lack of response from the client.

- i. MSCI  has  withdrawn  a  certificate  holder's  licence  or  other  agreement  to  use  the trademarks,  and  following  that,  the  certificate  holder  does  not  comply  with  MSCI instruction within stated timeframes.

For  clients  handling  seaweed,  the  MSCI  has  withdrawn  their  Seaweed  Partnership Agreement.

## Guidance 7.4.10.i

The CoC certificate may be suspended if the CAB obtains its own evidence that the client has not followed MSCI instructions after the withdrawal of the licence agreement.

For  clients  handling  seaweed,  they  should  sign  and  follow  the  instructions  in  the  Seaweed Partnership Agreement. The CAB may suspend or withdraw the certificate if the client failed to do so.

If the certificate is suspended for seaweed, the whole CoC certificate will be suspended.

- j. The client does not meet the MSC's Labour Eligibility Requirements.
- 7.4.11 Where the CAB suspends a client for the reasons defined in 7.4.10.g or 7.4.10.h, the CAB shall follow 7.4.16 onwards.
- 7.4.12 The CAB shall suspend a stratum of a CoC certificate as per CoCCR 9.4.6.1.a for Group Certificates.
- 7.4.13 The CAB shall suspend an individual site of a CoC Default Standard multi-site certificate if the CAB determines the reason for suspension to be site-specific without an impact on the other certified sites.
- a. The  CAB  shall  also  raise  a  major  non-conformity  against  the  certified  entity's management system (the main organisation which holds the Default Standard multi-site certificate) as per CoC Standard 5.1.1.

## Guidance 7.4.13.a

The client may address this major non-conformity by removing the site from their certificate, if the cause for suspension is not addressed.

- 7.4.14 Where the CAB finds cause for suspension against any of the reasons described in 7.4.10.ag,  the  CAB  shall  determine  if  the  break  in  integrity  of  the  certified  supply  chain  was intentional and/or systematic.

## Guidance 7.4.14

- 'Systematic' refers to cases where the issue is due to a failure of the organisation's management system, rather than an isolated occurrence.

'Intentional' refers to cases where there is evidence of purposeful failure of the organisation's action or inaction.

For  example,  if  the  organisation  did  not  develop  or  implement  adequate  procedures  to  ensure conformity  with  the  CoC  Standard  that  led  to  numerous  non-conformities,  this  may  indicate  a systematic  breach  of  the  Chain  of  Custody.  Or,  if  the  client  was  aware  of  non-conformities  but repeatedly  did  not  take  action  to  address  the  issues,  this  could  also  indicate  an  intentional  and systematic breach.

- 7.4.14.1 If the cause of the suspension is determined to be intentional and/or systematic, the CAB:
- a. Shall set the period of suspension at a minimum of 6 months.
- b. Should in verification activities include monitoring the activities of the suspended client.

## Guidance 7.4.14.1.b

For example, verification activities could include submission and review of all purchasing and sales documents, conducting unannounced audits, or interviews with the client to verify their understanding of CoC requirements and the ability to train other members of staff.

- c. Shall, prior to accepting that the corrective action has been effective, perform an  on-site  expedited  verification  audit  (as  per  7.4.17.d)  and  at  a  later  date perform a second on-site unannounced audit as part of the regular surveillance audit program i.e. surveillance or re-certification audit.
- i. The CAB shall record both audits in the scheme database.

## Guidance 7.4.14.1.c

The first on-site expedited verification audit happens within the 6-month suspension period prior to the CAB accepting the client's corrective action. If the CAB verifies that the client has successfully addressed the reason for suspension, the CAB will action 7.4.18.

After  the  reinstatement  of  the  certificate,  the  CAB  undertakes  an  on-site  surveillance  audit.  The unannounced on-site surveillance audit can replace the annual surveillance audit, and the client can be notified of the 6-month window it will take place within, but the CAB provides no notice of the actual date.

- 7.4.14.2 If the client identifies and reports an issue of mislabelling or non-conforming product (as in 7.4.10.b and 7.4.10.c), the certificate shall not be suspended subject to the client having followed the non-conforming product procedure in the CoC Standard.
- a. The CAB shall verify the effectiveness of these corrective actions within 30 days of first notification about the issue.

## Guidance 7.4.14.2.a

The corrective actions are effective when the identified causes for occurrence of non-conforming product have been addressed satisfactorily by implementing measures to prevent their re-occurrence following the non-conforming product procedure in the CoC Standard.

- 7.4.14.3 If any relevant requirements on non-conforming product in the CoC Standard have not been followed, or the corrective actions are not determined to be effective, the CAB shall suspend the certificate and follow 7.4.16 onwards.
- 7.4.15 Where the CAB finds cause for suspension against 7.4.10.j, the CAB shall set the period of suspension for a minimum of 3 months or until the client is in conformance with the specific requirements on  forced and  child labour found  within the MSC  Labour  Eligibility Requirements, whichever period is longer.
- 7.4.16 If a CoC certificate is suspended, the CAB shall, on the date of suspension:
- a. Inform  the  MSC  of  any  potential  impacts  of  the  suspension  on  relevant  Chains  of Custody of which it is aware.
- b. Inform the client of the suspension and instruct them:
- i. Not to sell any products as certified from the date of suspension.
- ii. To advise all sites of the suspension (if relevant).
- iii. To advise existing and potential customers in writing of the suspension within 4 days of the CAB's instruction to do so.
- A. Final consumers purchasing certified products do not need to be notified.
- iv. To keep records of advice to customers.
- v. Not to make any claims of certification from the day of suspension.

## Guidance 7.4.16.b.v

During suspension, the continued use of trademarks and other claims of conformity with the relevant Standard is not permitted. The client's status will be updated as appropriate on publicly-available sources of information controlled by the CAB and/or certification scheme.

- c. Determine whether the client has had their certificate suspended under 7.4.10.b for a second time within the period of validity of the certificate, in which case the CAB shall:
- i. Withdraw the certificate  on the scheme database  within  4  days  of  such second suspension and record the cause of certificate withdrawal in the comment box.
- ii. Instruct the client that they may not reapply for CoC certification for 2 years from the date of certificate withdrawal.

## Guidance 7.4.16.c

The  CAB  could  record  the  information  in  a  comment  box,  using  text  such  as:  'CoC  certificate suspended for a second time under 7.4.10.b therefore certificate withdrawn. Client excluded from reapplying for CoC certification until [insert date]'.

If the client wishes to reapply for certification, the CAB could conduct the audit shortly before the 2year period to enable the certificate to be issued after 2 years.

- 7.4.17 When a CoC certificate is suspended, the CAB shall also:
- a. Record the suspension on the MSC scheme database within 4 days of the suspension, including:
- i. The clause the suspension is raised against.
- ii. A description of evidence for suspension.
- iii. Change of certificate status.
- b. Suspend the certificate until such time that the cause of the suspension has been fully addressed, or for a 6-month minimum period if relevant as in 7.4.14.1.a.
- c. Instruct the client to provide a documented corrective action plan for addressing the cause of suspension, which is acceptable to the CAB as being able to address the cause(s) for suspension, within 30 days from the date of suspension.
- i. The corrective action plan shall include a binding timeframe.
- A. If the client submits an acceptable corrective action plan within 30 days, instruct the client to implement the corrective action plan.
- B. If  the certificate  holder does not submit an acceptable corrective action plan within 30 days, withdraw the certificate.
- d. Verify  the  effectiveness  of  the  corrective  action  once  informed  by  the  client  of  its completion.

## Guidance 7.4.17.d

Verification activities can include the CAB requesting traceability and/or purchase/sale records for review or conducting short-notice  or unannounced audits.  If a  minimum  6 months  suspension  is triggered (as per 7.4.14.1), an on-site expedited audit would be required to verify the suspension corrective action.

- 7.4.18 When the CAB has verified that the CoC client has addressed the reason for suspension, the CAB shall:
- a. Update and close  out  the  suspension  on  the  MSC  scheme  database  within  4  days following  reinstatement,  with  details  on  how  the  cause  of  suspension  has  been satisfactorily addressed and prevented.
- b. Reinstate the certificate.
- 7.4.19 If  the  verification  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  corrective  actions to address the  reason for suspension in the required timeframe cannot be concluded, the CAB shall withdraw the certificate and follow 7.4.16.c.i-ii.

## Guidance 7.4.19

Suspension always needs to precede withdrawal of a certificate. When a certificate is withdrawn the CAB may no longer be in a contractual agreement with the client.

## 7.5 Information on certificates

- 7.5.1 The CAB shall issue a certificate in English which, in addition to requirements in ISO 17065 7.7, contains:
- a. The latest published version of the MSC and/or ASC label, which:
- i. Shall be no smaller than the logo of the CAB.
- ii. For client handling seaweed, the label selected should be based on the seaweed production category (i.e. MSC label for wild-caught - category A, ASC for farmed category Bii and Cii, and ASC for enhanced - category Bi and Ci).

## Guidance 7.5.2

The CAB's CoC certificates may include the address of the client's other office(s) if these differ from the site where the main audit activity took place. If additional addresses are listed, the main activity performed at these addresses needs to be noted on the certificate, to avoid confusion with the site where the main audit activity took place.

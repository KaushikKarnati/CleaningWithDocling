## 1.0 Structure and Process

## 1.1 Introduction

Recognizing  the  urgent  need  to  promote  responsible  practices  throughout  the  aquaculture  and  wild seafood industry, the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) coordinates the development of Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) standards to address environmental and social responsibility, animal welfare, food safety, and traceability practices throughout the aquaculture supply chain, and the Best Seafood Practices (BSP) standards to address social responsibility and worker health and safety through a voluntary certification program.

GSA's broad objective is to drive continued industry-wide improvements by setting high standards that deliver  significant  benefits  while  representing  realistic  objectives  for  the  majority  of  operations.  It  is recognized that most operations will need to implement changes in their practices to comply with GSA standards, which are dynamic and respond to improved technology, better management practices, greater scientific understanding, and the emergence of new issues.

The  BAP  standards  and  certification  procedures  strive  to  be  consistent  with  relevant  international guidelines  for  aquaculture  certification  programs,  such  as  the  United  Nations  Food  and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) Technical Guidelines on Aquaculture Certification (2011) and the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance (ISEAL) Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental Standards (2014).

The BSP standards and certification procedures will strive to be consistent with relevant international guidelines for the vessel certification program, such as the United Nations International Bill of Human Rights of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Convention 188 working in fishing and the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance (ISEAL) Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental Standards and the ISO 17065 certification protocols .

Compliance with all GSA standards is assessed by auditors supplied by independent certification bodies with training in the standards. The auditors must have relevant knowledge, experience, and credentials.

Copies of the current BAP and BSP standards and guidelines, which are copyrighted by the Global Seafood Alliance, are available free of charge in electronic format on the BAP and BSP websites.

## 1.2 Standards Oversight Committee

To promote broad stakeholder involvement, consensus, and transparency in the standards development process,  GSA  delegates  the  primary  guidance  and  oversight  for  the  process  to  a  Standards  Oversight Committee (SOC), whose members represent one-third industry, one-third non-governmental conservation and social  justice  organizations,  and  one-third  academic  and  regulatory  interests.  The  SOC  directs  the drafting of all standards by BAP and BSP Technical Committees (TC's) and reports its recommendations to the GSA Board of Directors for final standards approval.

With  guidance  from  the  GSA  Board  and  assistance  from  the  GSA  Standards  Coordinator,  the  SOC coordinates  revisions  and  oversees  the  various  processes  of  standards  development.  The  SOC  can recommend adjustments in the standards development process to the GSA Board and set overarching goals for BAP and BSP certification, such as including more performance metrics for consideration by the TC's.

## 1.3 Technical Committees

The TC's develop the standards via separate committees for unique species groups (e.g., mollusks, salmon, and seaweed) or production process (e.g., fishing, farming, feed milling, and seafood processing). Each Standard is reviewed, revised, and voted upon by a TC composed of technical experts and representatives of those groups interested in or affected by the standards. The standards drafted by each committee are forwarded to the SOC for approval. The SOC also approves committee membership, ensuring that each committee represents a balance of stakeholders.

TC chairpersons are evaluated by the GSA Standards Coordinator and approved by the SOC based on their technical  expertise,  leadership  experience,  and  communication  skills.  Chairpersons  are  required  to  act impartially in maintaining the orderly conduct of committee meetings and processing committee input.

## 1.4 GSA Standards Coordinator

The GSA Standards Coordinator works closely with the Standards Oversight Committee and Technical committee chairpersons to carry out the general administration of the standards. The SOC, Standards Coordinator, and TC chairpersons establish program goals and target dates for the key stages of public comment and publication.

The  Standards  Coordinator,  who  is  a  GSA  employee  or  contractor  is  appointed  by  the  GSA  Board  of Directors based on nominations from the SOC and other interested parties. The Standards Coordinator, helps  chairpersons  guide  committees,  advises  on  general  standards  policies,  and  coordinates  among committees.  The  Standards  Coordinator  also  helps  prepare  committee  draft  standards  and  related documents as needed and is responsible for assuring that all records remain on file for at least one full standards revision period, including keeping Curriculum Vitae and Conflict of Interest declarations of TC Members as needed to maintain a record of their technical expertise and affiliations.

## 1.5 Standards Development

GSA's  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  standards  define  the  most  important  elements  of  responsible aquaculture  and  provide  quantitative  metrics  and  auditing  procedures  whereby  adherence  to  those practices can be determined. By defining acceptable materials, methods, and processes, and identifying appropriate performance metrics and targets, the standards directly address food safety, environmental, social, animal welfare, and product traceability concerns.

GSA's Best Seafood Practices standards defines the most important elements of responsible practices on board fishing and tender vessels with specific requirements on social compliance and provides quantitative metrics and auditing procedures whereby adherence  to  those  practices can be determined.  By  defining acceptable  materials,  methods,  and  processes,  and  identifying  appropriate  performance  metrics  and targets, the standards directly address social concerns.

Care is taken to apply 'SMART' criteria in the drafting of standards so they can be applied objectively in the field. The SMART acronym identifies the characteristics of well-designed standards: Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Realistic, and Time-related.

Working with the Standards Coordinator, the SOC strives to ensure that the standards development process is consistent with relevant FAO and ISEAL guidelines. As part of this effort, the SOC and the Standards Coordinator ensure that the overall process, including procedures and public input opportunities, are made transparent to the public through the GSA, BAP, and BSP websites. The SOC will also develop a formal public appeals process.

## 1.5.1 Development Process

The stages in the preparation of new or updated Best Aquaculture Practices standards or revisions are listed below. The Standards Coordinator manages and facilitates the flow of information throughout the development process.

- 1. Preliminary draft
- 2. Committee draft or drafts
- 3. Public comment draft
- 4. Final committee draft
- 5. Standards Oversight Committee review
- 6. Global Seafood Alliance Board of Directors approval

Preliminary drafts are  developed by TC chairpersons with the assistance of expert consultants or GSA technical  staff  members,  and  the  Standards  Coordinator.  Development  of  preliminary  drafts  involves reviews of existing best management practices and standards from outside bodies and may include draft material submitted by other interested organizations or individuals.

Committee drafts incorporate TC's changes that arise from their examination of preliminary drafts and must reflect consensus among the committee members. Copies of the drafts are provided to the SOC, which can suggest changes through the Standards Coordinator or Technical Committee chairpersons. If there are many contentious points or points requiring further investigation or testing, there may be several committee drafts. Completed committee drafts pass to the Standards Coordinator in preparation for public comment. If a consensus cannot be achieved among the committee the Technical Committee shall vote on approval of this draft with a majority vote of no less than 75% of Technical Committee members voting. The Technical Committee Chair shall be a non-voting party except in the event of a tie, where they will cast the final vote.

When votes  are  conducted  through  email,  a  period  of  two  weeks  (14  calendar  days)  will  be  given  for response. Only votes received during this two-week period will be counted when establishing a quorum. The Standards Coordinator shall be responsible for establishing the timeline.

Public comment drafts are made available for 60 days of public comment on the BAP or BSP websites. In addition to the public, members of the SOC are encouraged to submit comments. All comments received are carefully considered by the appropriate TC's, although not all submissions are incorporated into the standards. Properly submitted comments will receive responses from the committee chairpersons or the GSA Standards Coordinator, with the assistance of GSA technical staff as needed. The comments and responses will be posted on the BAP/BSP website(s).

Final drafts incorporate the public comment changes upon which the TC members agree. Final drafts are approved by a positive vote by at least 75% of a quorum of 60% or more of the committee membership.

Approved final drafts then proceed to SOC review, in which the proposed standards are examined and voted upon by the members of the SOC. The SOC must endorse the drafts with at least 80% approval in a vote by a  minimum  of  ten  SOC  members  or  return  the  drafts  for  further  revision  to  the  TC,  along  with  clear explanation of the reasons the SOC did not approve the draft. At least three members from each main stakeholder group must participate in approval votes. The SOC cannot modify the standards or apply 'line -item vetoes.' The Standard Coordinator is also notified of the status of final drafts.

When votes  are  conducted  through  email,  a  period  of  two  weeks  (14  calendar  days)  will  be  given  for response. Only votes received during this two-week period will be counted when establishing a quorum. The Standards Coordinator shall be responsible for establishing the timeline.

When final drafts are approved by SOC ballot, they are forwarded for GSA Board of Directors approval. The SOC must report its decisions to approve or return final drafts for further revision to TC's within 30 days. If a strong minority position related to the approved standards is expressed, it will also be reported to the board and posted on the BAP/BSP website(s).

The GSA Board of Directors must endorse the final standards with a two-thirds vote of approval or return the  standards  to  the  SOC.  The  board  cannot  modify  the  standards  or  apply  'line  -item  vetoes.'  Once approved by the GSA board, the completed standards are forwarded to the GSA management office for implementation.

## 1.6 New Standards and Standards Revisions

The priority of new standards development is determined by GSA with guidance from the SOC and the Standards Coordinator. The preliminary development of new standards incorporates input from TC's that includes framing the key elements associated with a given process for one or more species or product type.

The Standards Oversight Committee works with the TC's to annually review the GSA standards and to make appropriate changes at least every four years. The committees attempt to incorporate innovations and progress generated in a range of seafood forums and international conventions, such as meetings of the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Maritime Organization, United Nations Human Rights Council, SEA Forum for Fishers, and the Seafood Task Force, the World Aquaculture Association, etc.  Regular reviews ensure the GSA standards represent current international best practices.

Although one goal of the continuous improvement process for the GSA standards is to include additional performance  metrics,  appropriate  metrics  may  not  currently  be  established  for  all  elements  of  GSA certification.  GSA  will  continue  to  evaluate  pertinent  data  collected  via  certification  inspections  and associated record reviews.

When minor errors are found in published standards documents, or clarification to existing clauses are necessary, proposed corrections are considered by the SOC and appropriate TC chairpersons, who have the option to enact the corrections or pass them on for further committee review. When new material or other significant changes to existing standards are presented, the complete review and approval process must be followed.

Over  time,  less-relevant  standards  may  be  considered  for  withdrawal.  In  such  cases,  the  intention  to withdraw a standard will be announced well in advance to allow comment. Where there is sufficient interest, the standard may be revised and retained.

## 1.7 GSA Standards Development Process

- 1. GSA highest level of senior leadership requests standard from the Standards Oversight Committee.
- 2. SOC reviews request and works with Standards Coordinator to assign development of preliminary draft.
- 3. Standards Coordinator coordinates with TC chairperson to form TC, if needed, or direct existing TC to review preliminary draft.
- 4. TC returns revised committee draft to Standards Coordinator, and SOC reviews committee draft.
- 5. Standards Coordinator formalizes Public Comment draft documents with GSA technical staff and passes on for 60-day Public Comment period.
- 6.  Submitted  Public  Comments are managed by TC chairperson or the Standards Coordinator and considered by Technical Committee.
- 7. TC revises committee draft and completes final draft.
- 8. TC votes on final draft and returns approved version to Standards Coordinator and SOC.
- 9. Standards Coordinator and SOC review final draft.
- 10. SOC votes on final draft and sends approved standards to GSA Board of Directors or sends draft back to TC for additional work.
- 11. GSA Board approves standard and forwards to GSA management office for implementation.

## 2.0 Committee Selection, Duties and Functions

## 2.1 Introduction

To promote broad stakeholder involvement, consensus, and transparency in the development of the GSA standards, the GSA delegates primary oversight for the process to a Standards Oversight Committee (SOC). The SOC directs the drafting of all standards by TC's and makes recommendations to the GSA Board of Directors for final standards approval.

The diverse composition of the SOC and TC's provides broad technical and stakeholder representation. GSA's  Standards  Coordinator  works  with  all  committees  in  a  coordinating  role  within  the  standards development process.

Committee chairpersons manage committee activities and ensure their members' work falls within project guidelines.  New  projects  commence  only  after  they  are  endorsed  by  the  GSA  Board  of  Directors  with guidance from the SOC to ensure adequate resource allocation and avoid duplication among committees and external organizations.

## 2.2 Committee Representation

## 2.2.1 Standards Oversight Committee

The SOC is composed of technical experts and representatives of those groups interested in or affected by the BAP standards. Care is taken to ensure a balance among the different sectors of interest.

The target composition of the Standards Oversight Committee includes a mix of producer organizations, trade  groups,  regulatory  bodies,  academic  institutions,  non-governmental  organizations,  and  other stakeholders:

- · Five representatives from relevant seafood producers or regional seafood industry associations from around the world
- · Five representatives from relevant conservation or social justice non-governmental organizations
- · Five representatives from relevant academic, regulatory, or policy groups.

<!-- image -->

Initially,  members  of  the  SOC  will  be  nominated  by  stakeholders  and  appointed  by  the  GSA  Board  of Directors to serve three-year terms with a maximum of four consecutive terms, i.e., max 12 years in total. Terms will be staggered so that no more than four members come up for potential replacement during any particular year.

After the SOC is formed, its members will nominate candidates to fill vacancies who must then be approved by the GSA board. The SOC will also establish a process for public nominations.

Individuals are appointed to the SOC as representatives of companies, organizations, or other entities. They serve until  the  completion  of  their  appointed  terms  and  may  only  be  replaced  upon  mutual  agreement between  the  GSA  Board  and  the  organizations  they  represent.  Companies  or  organizations  can  be represented in successive terms but may not have more than one representative on the SOC at any given time.  In cases where an individual acting as a representative of a particular stakeholder category leaves the employ of the organization they were representing, the GSA may, at its sole discretion, either request the original organization to nominate a new representative, or the GSA can elect to retain the individual as a  continuing  member  of  the  SOC,  as  long  as  the  individual's  new  organizational  affiliation  does  not represent a change in stakeholder category.

## 2.2.2 Technical Committees

Each Technical Committee (TC) is composed of technical experts and representatives of those groups interested in or affected by the standards. Care is taken to ensure a balance among the different sectors of interest.

Although not rigidly defined, the target composition of the TC's includes a mix of varied stakeholders:

- · Four representatives from relevant seafood producers or regional seafood industry associations from around the world
- · Four representatives from relevant conservation or social justice non-governmental organizations
- · Four representatives from relevant academic, regulatory, or policy groups.

The Standards Coordinator works with the TC chairpersons in recruiting TC members to participate in the standards development process. Nominations from the SOC are welcome. The SOC must approve in total the slate of proposed committee members with at least 80% approval in a vote by a minimum of ten SOC members or ask the Coordinator to seek additional nominees. At least three members from each main stakeholder group must participate in approval votes.

Committee members serve an initial term of three years or until the work of the committee is completed, as  determined  by  the  Standards  Coordinator  in  concert  with  the  SOC.  Committee  members  may  be reappointed for two additional terms.

## 2.2.3 Committee Chairpersons

Effective  chairpersons  are  key  to  the  success  of  voluntary  committees.  These  individuals  must  be energetic, credible, knowledgeable, solution-oriented, and statesmen.

The  principal  tasks  of  committee  chairpersons  are  to  manage  committee  meetings  and  ensure  that committee  members  adhere  to  the  defined  process  in  the  preparation  of  standards.  Chairpersons encourage committee members to prepare material thoroughly before meetings, work efficiently, adhere to work programs, and be mindful of target dates and priorities. They also assist in providing responses to comments received during the public comment periods for GSA standards.

Chairpersons have dual roles to communicate the interests of the groups they represent as well as act as neutral facilitators for committee discussions. Chairpersons must declare their interests and make it clear when they put forward the views of their groups as opposed to their normal neutral positions as chairs. In discussions  where  there  could  be  conflicts  of  interest,  chairpersons  can  ask  the  GSA  Standards Coordinator or other committee members to chair meetings.

Chairpersons  can  overrule  trivial  meeting  concerns  but  should  always  consider  the  minority  voices  on committees. If differing views are irreconcilable, chairpersons can seek advice from the GSA Standards Coordinator.

The Standards Oversight Committee chairperson will initially be appointed by the GSA Board of Directors for a period of one year. In subsequent years, the chairperson will be elected by SOC committee members.

Technical Committee chairpersons are recommended by the GSA Standards Coordinator and must be approved by the SOC with at least 80% approval in a vote by a minimum of ten SOC members. At least three members from each main stakeholder group must participate in approval votes. TC chairpersons serve an initial term of three years or until the work of the committee is completed. They may be reappointed for two additional terms.

Chairperson nominees should carefully consider the resource requirements associated with the role before accepting  their  positions.  These  include  making  time  for  attending  meetings  as  well  as  considerable communications outside meetings with committee members, the SOC, and BAP Coordinator.

## 2.2.4 GSA Standards Coordinator

The GSA Standards Coordinator, a staff member or contractor of the Global Seafood Alliance, works largely as a conduit of information between the SOC and TC's. In addition to assisting chairpersons with committee membership, the Standards Coordinator confers with committee chairpersons in setting progress goals and schedules. The Standards Coordinator helps chairpersons guide committee members and coordinates among committees. He or she may participate as needed in technical discussions as an active, but nonvoting participant. The GSA Standards Coordinator may assist in preparing committee draft standards and related papers to enhance consistency among the various standards. The final formatting and presentation of public comment drafts and final standards are the shared responsibility of the Coordinator and GSA technical staff members.

The GSA Standards Coordinator is also generally responsible for inquiries from the public regarding the GSA standards and certification. Depending on the nature and complexity of the inquiries, he or she may enlist  the  assistance  of  the  SOC,  committee  chairpersons,  or  other  committee  members  in  developing appropriate responses.

The Standards Coordinator is chosen by the GSA Board of Directors and employed by the Global Seafood Alliance as either a full-time employee or as a contractor. If the position of Coordinator becomes vacant, the board appoints a replacement. In such an event, the SOC is encouraged to nominate candidates for the position.

## 2.2.5 Committee Member Commitment

Individual  committee  members  review  issues,  vote  on  drafts,  and  consider  proposals  for  both  new standards and revisions to existing standards. They participate in meetings whenever possible to provide technical input on standards. During meetings, they must impartially consider other members' positions as well  as  public  comments  on  draft  standards.  Following  public  comment,  committee  members  vote  on drafts of standards.

All  members  of  committees  must  declare  any  conflicts  of  interest  they  may  have  in  the  outcomes  of committee decisions. During standards development, committee members are encouraged to interact with colleagues and other stakeholders to gather their viewpoints. However, inquiries from the media should be directed to the GSA Standards Coordinator.

## 2.2.6 Committee Meetings

Meetings are scheduled on a regular basis by committee chairpersons and the GSA Standards Coordinator. To allow committee members to properly review materials, meeting agendas and associated documents are circulated electronically two weeks prior to meetings.

Whenever practical, meetings are held via audio conferencing and other electronic methods that include the online delivery of standards drafts and other documents. The Global Seafood Alliance minimizes the number of face-to-face meetings. Venue selection considers the elements of cost and convenience to committee members and may often overlap with other international aquaculture meetings.

Each SOC committee member can select an individual to represent him/her and vote by proxy at meetings. These individuals are counted when determining a quorum.

Committee meetings are normally only open to members. Requests for attendance by visitors require the prior  approval  of  the  Standards  Oversight  Committee,  GSA  Standards  Coordinator,  or  the  appropriate committee chairpersons.

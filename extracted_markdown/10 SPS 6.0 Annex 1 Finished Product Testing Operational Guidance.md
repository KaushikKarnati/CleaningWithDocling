Seafood Processing Standard - Annex 1

Issue Number 1.0

Effective Date: 05-NOV-2025 Published Date: 04-NOV-2024

Status External

## Introductio n

The purpose of Annex I is to provide operational guidance to the certification bodies, auditors and facilities that  are  required  to  conduct  finished  product  testing. The  Seafood  Processing  Standard  (SPS)  has identified three categories of risk to determine if finished product testing is required.  The categories are low, elevated, and high risk.  Finished product testing is required for all facilities that fall under the elevated and highrisk categories.

The following information is contained in Annex 1

- · Defining risk status
- · Sample selection
- · Auditor required documentation
- · Sample compositing requirements
- · What type of testing shall be conducted
- · Laboratory and methodology requirements

## How to use Annex I

- · Refer to section 1.0 Risk Status that provides the definitions and criteria for each of the risk categories.
- · Determine if finished product testing is required based on the criteria in section 1.0
- · If the assessment determines that the facility falls within the elevated or high risk categories, -proceed to Section 2.0 Instructions for Facilities and Auditors.
- · Low risk assessments that fall outside of elevated or high risk categories are exempt from -product testing .

## 1.0 Risk Status:

## 1.1 Elevated Risk Status

Facilities will be initially designated under the Elevated R isk status if they fall under any of the criteria in 1 .1.1 -1 .1.4 below.

- 1 .1.1 New  facilities applying for certification located in regions of high production and antimicrobial  use, or  in  countries  with  high numbers  of US  FDA  refusals or  equivalent regulatory  enforcement actions .    Specifically, new facilities  applying  to  the  GSA  P rogram located in China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, or Vietnam.
- 1 .1.2 New facilities applying for SPS certification that have been listed on the US FDA Refusal List (or  international  equivalent)  for microbiological  pathogens,  banned  chemical residues , or histamine within the past 12 months prior to applying.

- 1 .1.3 SPS certified facilities (or renewal in process) receiving nonconformities under local , federal, or  national  agency  inspection  refusal  for microbiological  pathogens,  banned  chemical residu es, or histamine. When this occurs during a certification cycle, the facility shall be required to notify their certification body and GSA within 48 hours of the notification of the nonconformity, along with a written explanation of the nonconformity.  Additionally, within 14 days, th e facility shall provide a detailed corrective action plan that includes a root cause analysis . GSA will review the findings and determine if a supplementary T argeted Audit 1  that includes assessment of corrective actions and Finished Product Testing as described herein. In addition, the facility shall be required to undergo Finished Product Testing during their next recertification audit .
- 1 .1.4 A facility that does not meet GSA Action levels specified in the Finished Product Testing Tables 2, 3, and 4 during a finished product testing event in either a targeted or certification audit may be  required  to  undergo  an  additional  1 -day  Targeted  Audit  that  includes assessment  of  corrective  actions  and  finished  product  testing  as  described  herein.    In addition, the facility shall be required to undergo Finished Product Testing during their next recertification audit.

## 1.2 High Risk Status

A facility that fails 3 Finished Product Testing events is considered High Risk and subject to suspension from the SPS Program.

## 1.3 Low Risk Status

Facilities designated as Low R isk are those that fall outside designation criteria 1 .1 and 1 .2. Facilities that have successfully passed Finished Product Testing requirements under 1 .1 will  be  moved  to  Low  Risk Status  and  exempt  from  product  testing  during all recertification  audits as  long  as  Low  Risk  Status designation is maintained.

## 2.0 Instructions for Facilities and Auditors

- 2 .1 All Finished Product Testing under th e SPS shall be under the supervision of an assigned auditor.  Plant ongoing monitoring is encouraged but no longer required under SPS Finished Product Testing .
- 2 2 . At  the  beginning  of  an  audit,  facilities  shall present  to  the  auditor  a  full  inventory  of  all products in storage. Auditors shall use this list to select lots for sampling, and for assessing potential discrepancies between inventory sheets and identification codes on packaging in storage. No product in storage can be excluded from the  inventory list. This  includes products destined for local distribution.   Sampling lots should be selected by the auditor based on potential risk factors observed by audi tors .
- 2 .3 The auditor has a role during the annual audit to arrange for the selection and collection of samples to be sent to a qualified t hird-party laboratory for testing. Plants are responsible for all testing costs related to certification. SPS sampling requirements do not override legal sampling and testing obligations.

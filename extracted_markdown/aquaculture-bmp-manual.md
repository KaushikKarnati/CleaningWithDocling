## I. INTRODUCTION

Florida aquaculture has a vested interest in protecting and managing environmental resources.  As conscientious environmental stewards, this responsibility lies with each aquatic farmer.  The Florida Legislature and the aquaculture farming community worked to amend the Florida Aquaculture Policy Act, Chapter 597, Florida Statutes (F.S.), to create the Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and Aquaculture Best Management Practices (BMPs).

The BMPs in this manual are intended to preserve environmental integrity while eliminating cumbersome, duplicative and confusing environmental permitting and licensing requirements.  Aquaculturists following these practices meet the minimum standards necessary for protecting and maintaining offsite water quality and wildlife habitat.  These practices represent a mutually beneficial relationship between commercial aquaculture production and natural resource protection.  These BMPs were developed specifically for Florida aquaculture to protect Florida's natural resources and as required by Florida law are to be implemented at all certified aquaculture operations.  As part of the annual aquaculture certification process, you, the Florida aquaculturist, have pledged your intention to implement these practices as part of the ongoing daily management practices at your facility.

Unless authorized in statute the BMPs enumerated in this manual do not supersede other applicable federal or local authorities nor natural resource collection authorizations.  Therefore, aquaculturists need to be aware of the pertinent environmental regulations that affect surface water quality, navigability, wetland dredge and fill, and/or endangered species issues.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) must approve collection of broodstock, from natural populations, for aquacultural purposes. Furthermore, operators need to recognize that there are other federal, state, and local regulations not specifically listed in this manual which relate to solid and hazardous waste disposal, worker safety and building and zoning considerations.

Aquatic species not specifically mentioned in the BMP manual are covered under chapters applicable to all aquaculture facilities.  All certified aquaculturists are required to follow the BMPs in Chapters II through VI and XIV through XIX, including obtaining necessary federal permits.  The species or methods specifically identified in this manual have unique circumstances requiring more specific management practices to mitigate the potential for environmental impacts.  For a complete list of BMPs required for your aquatic species, see the Appendix.

For additional information about these aquaculture BMPs, general aquaculture information or assistance in clarifying requirements specific to your aquaculture operation, please contact the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS), Division of Aquaculture at The Holland Building, Suite 217, 600 South Calhoun Street, Tallahassee, Florida, 32399, phone (850) 617-7600.

## II. COMPLIANCE MONITORING

The Best Management Practices (BMPs) in this manual are required for implementation by all holders of an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration. Anyone conducting aquacultural activities not in compliance with this manual and/or not certified by FDACS is in violation of Florida Law, and is subject to the penalties described below and required to obtain any and all permits required by the appropriate state and county or local regulatory agencies (i.e., Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Water Management District (WMD), Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC)).

Pursuant to Sections 597.004(2)(b) and (c), Florida Statutes (F.S.), notwithstanding any provision of law, FDEP is not authorized to institute proceedings against any person certified under this section to recover any costs or damages associated with contamination of groundwater or surface water, or the evaluation, assessment, or remediation of contamination of groundwater or surface water, including sampling, analysis, and restoration of potable water supplies, where the contamination of groundwater or surface water is determined to be the result of aquaculture practices.

There is a presumption of compliance with state groundwater and surface water standards if the holder of an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration implements best management practices that have been verified by FDEP to be effective at representative sites and complies with the following:

- 1.       Provides the department with a notice of intent to implement applicable best management practices adopted by the department;
- 2.      Implements applicable best management practices as soon as practicable according to rules adopted by the department; and
- 3.      Implements practicable interim measures identified and adopted by the department which can be implemented immediately, or according to rules adopted by the department.

Pursuant to the Florida Aquaculture Policy Act, Chapter 597, F.S., certified aquaculturists must fully implement all applicable BMPs described in this manual.  The BMPs must be implemented upon initiation of operation and maintained for the duration of that phase of operation by the holder of an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and followed for the term of the certificate.  As such, FDACS authorized representatives will periodically visit the site to inspect the facility and records as required herein.

In order to remain in good standing with the Department's Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and Best Management Practices Program, the following compliance requirements are the expectations that must be fully understood and adhered to:

## A. COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

- 1. All applicable BMPs must be implemented immediately and followed for the full term of the certificate.
- 2. Upon signature and submission of an application for Aquaculture Certificate of Registration, the applicant has filed a notice of intent that he or she will comply with the BMPs described in this manual.
- 3. Representatives of FDACS, will periodically conduct an unannounced physical inspection of the farm and a review of records (where required), to ascertain BMP compliance.
- 4. Operators of aquaculture facilities that are unable or unwilling to comply with the BMPs or whose proposed activities are not covered by the BMPs will be directed to the appropriate regulatory agencies to obtain applicable permits.  When an operator chooses the permit option, failure to comply with the permit conditions will subject the operator with the enforcement action of the permitting agency and enforcement by FDACS pursuant to Rule 5L-3.007, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.).

## B. INSPECTION PROTOCOL

FDACS staff will conduct unannounced onsite inspections at least once during each year and reinspections as needed.

The certificate holder must maintain and provide access to copies of pertinent records as required by subsequent chapters in this manual.

## C. PENALTIES

Any person who violates any provision of the Florida Aquaculture Policy Act, Chapter 597, F.S., or the Aquaculture Best Management Practices, Chapter 5L-3, F.A.C., commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, and is subject to a suspension or revocation of his or her Aquaculture Certificate of Registration.  The department may, in lieu of, or in addition to the suspension or revocation, impose on the violator an administrative fine in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation per day, pursuant to section 597.0041, F.S. Please see Rule 5L3.007, F.A.C., for specific administrative fine criteria.

## III. FEDERAL PERMITTING

## WETLANDS OR SOVEREIGNTY SUBMERGED LANDS

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) regulatory program is one of the oldest in the Federal Government and includes the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 which establishes permit requirements to prevent unauthorized obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the United States.  This navigable water's jurisdiction includes all navigable fresh waters and ocean waters out to a distance of 200 nautical miles.  Section 10 of this Act covers construction, excavation, or deposition of materials in, over, or under such waters which could affect the course, location, condition, or capacity of those waters.  Section 9 of this Act typically applies to dams and dikes.

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended in 1977, and commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, includes Section 404 authorizing the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to issue permits for dredging or filling waters of the United States. While the USACE acts as the lead permitting agency, the Environmental Protection Agency has veto powers and may invoke this authority at any time.

The basic form of authorization used by the USACE is the Individual Permit.  Another form of authorization is the General Permit that typically covers activities the USACE has identified as substantially similar in nature and causing only minimal environmental impacts. Nationwide General Permits, Programmatic General Permits, or General Permits may be applicable to aquaculturists contemplating activities in waters of the United States.

The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (Section 307) requires applicants to certify that projects are in compliance with an approved State Coastal Zone Management Program and that the State concurs with the applicant's certification prior to issuance of a USACE permit. Pursuant to Section 380.205, F.S., Coastal Zone means 'an area of land and water from the territorial limits to the most inland extent of marine influences.'  Florida Coastal Zone provisions generally apply only in the geographical area encompassed by 35 Florida coastal counties listed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Florida Coastal Management Program. Moreover, an aquaculturist proposing work on any state sovereignty submerged lands would also be required to contact FDACS to obtain a sovereignty submerged land's authorization.

The federal definition for agriculture does not include aquaculture.  Therefore, regarding wetlands protection, the USACE is the lead federal agency.  As such, many of the conventions developed by the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) pursuant to the Food Security Act (Swamp buster provisions) do not apply; thus, wetland determinations (i.e., prior converted) should not be taken for granted and you must receive all required Corps approvals/permits before construction activities commence.

Before considering or starting any activities that may impact wetlands or occur on sovereignty submerged lands, contact FDACS, WMDs, FDEP or the USACE for assistance.

State or federal wetland jurisdiction, delineation methodology, and regulations are not the same. Furthermore, existing Programmatic General Permits may already authorize certain activities for farmers that possess an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and sovereignty submerged land lease agreement.

## SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE

Responsibility for implementing and enforcing provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to surface water quality has been delegated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The applicable Federal rules and regulations are contained in Title 40, Chapter I, Part 122.24 and Part 122.25 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  The corresponding Florida rules and regulations can be found in Rule Chapters 62-620, 62-621, and 62-660, F.A.C.

Aquaculture is considered a point source, subject to industrial wastewater rules under the Clean Water Act and includes established thresholds when a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is required. Should an aquaculture facility exceed the NPDES size thresholds of more than 100,000 pounds of live weight production per year and discharges 30 days or more from the farm excluding rainfall events, the aquaculture effluent BMP will not apply and a NPDES permit from FDEP must be obtained.  Chapter IV, subsection E, of this document provides further detail.  An aquaculture facility that must acquire a NPDES permit must continue to maintain an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and implement all other applicable Aquaculture Best Management Practices.

## IV. WATER RESOURCES

## A. WATER SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS

Florida's five Water Management Districts issue a Water or Consumptive Use Permit that allows the withdrawal of a specified amount of water from either a groundwater well or from an allowable surface water source.  These permits are categorized as either Individual Permits (requiring Governing Board approval) or General Permits (staff level approval).  They typically require an application fee and are issued for 10 to 20 years.  Some Water Management Districts have declared certain groundwater basins as severely stressed and have designated as Water Use Caution Areas which may have more stringent permit issuance criteria and require well metering to track the amounts withdrawn. Within the Water Use Caution Areas there are also Most Impacted Areas where new consumptive use permits are no longer available.  To determine whether your facility is within one of these areas, contact your local Water Management District. Water Management Districts (in some cases the delegated local county government) also issue Well Construction Permits which are generally required if the aquaculturist either plans to have a new well constructed, or needs to repair or plug an existing well. Please note that the aquaculture BMP manual is not designed to replace the need for water use or well drilling permits; therefore, it is imperative for all water use situations that operators contact their local water management district Water Use Permitting Department to determine permitting requirements.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Contact the Water Management District and/or FDACS before constructing a well or withdrawing water from an unpermitted well.

## B. WATER CONSERVATION AND REUSE

The thoughtful use and management of water resources may improve productivity and profitability, and provide measurable conservation returns to Florida's environment.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Use water conservation practices where appropriate and feasible to minimize water use. Water conservation and reuse practices may include:
- · Recirculation systems
- · Maintaining proper freeboard levels
- · Maintaining perimeter ditches
- · Retaining production water on site
- · Water reuse practices
- · Reclaimed water
- · Alternate water sources

## C. SALTWATER SOURCES

There may be circumstances where aquaculture operations will need saline water to culture certain marine or estuarine plants or animals (i.e., shrimp or shellfish hatcheries).  There are two environmental issues which may arise: (1) potential permitting issues associated with withdrawal of saline water and (2) potential impacts to freshwater systems from saline water discharge.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Contact a Water Management District for permitting requirements to withdraw saline or mineralized (non-potable) water.
- · Saline water shall not be discharged to freshwater environments.
- · When utilizing a near shore saline water source, the intake and discharge pipes should be located so as not to interfere with navigation.
- · Facilities should be designed and installed to avoid or minimize impacts to resources, including scouring caused by discharge pipes.

## D. RECIRCULATING AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS

Production systems that treat and reuse all, or a major portion of their production water are termed Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS).  While the volume of effluent from a recirculating/intensive system does not typically approach the quantity associated with the more traditional forms of aquaculture, the concentration of nutrients associated with the effluent is usually greater.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Design the system for no direct offsite discharge of production water. Effluents must be treated and retained onsite, or discharged to a permitted sanitary sewer system. Treatment techniques include, but are not limited to percolation ponds, irrigation systems or filter strips.  These techniques may be utilized individually or in combination with other approved treatment methods. Please note that discharging production water to a sanitary sewer system may require authorization/permitting from the local municipal wastewater treatment plant authority.
- · Design a waste treatment system to accommodate the semisolid waste stream and nonrecycled production effluent from filters and solids separators.  Dispose of waste solids in a legal manner that will not cause environmental degradation.  Potential options for solids treatment and disposal include composting followed by appropriate land application as a soil amendment or disposal at a sanitary landfill.

## E. EFFLUENT TREATMENT

Effluent treatment BMPs are required of all certified aquaculturists except for those certified facilities, as specified in Rule 5L-3.006, F.A.C., that are determined to have a minimal impact on the surrounding environment or are required to obtain an NPDES permit (see appendix, Code of Federal Regulations).  These facilities are, however, required to follow all other applicable BMPs.

Minimal Impact Aquaculture Facilities include:

- (1)  Recirculation systems that do not discharge to waters of the state.
- (2)  Culture of filter feeders which does not include feed or fertilizer inputs.
- (3)  Raceway or upweller/downweller systems for native filter feeders that utilize less than 800 square feet of raceways or upwellers/downwellers, and do not add supplemental algae as a food source.
- (4)  Fee fishing operations with a standing crop of less than 1,000 pounds of fish per acre.
- (5)  Individual production units producing less than 10,000 pounds of product per year that minimize the release of sediments off site by using an onsite ditch system with a minimum 100 linear feet of ditch between the production water entry point and the discharge point and one foot of freeboard at the discharge point control structure.
- (6) Aquaculture systems that do not discharge production unit water to surface waters of the state.

Effluent or production water discharge from culture systems typically contain suspended or production water discharge to prevent or minimize environmental impact to receiving waters.

and settleable solids, both organic and inorganic, as well as other dissolved compounds as a result of feeding and other farm activities.  It is necessary for aquaculturists to manage effluent Because of the variation in production systems (e.g., ponds, cages or net pens, tanks and raceways), stocking rates, feed types, feed volumes, and feeding frequencies, in combination with variable site characteristics; several options for management of effluents are recommended as best management practices.  Contact FDACS for assistance in determining which option is most appropriate for your aquaculture operation or prior to changing an approved method implemented at your facility.

## Best Management Practices:

- · DETENTION FACILITY OPTION: Treatment of effluent prior to discharge to waters of the state by detention or temporary storage in a pond or ditch system.  Maximum feeding rates for production units utilizing a detention pond system are: 1) 180 pounds/acre/day for a one-day detention period; and 2) 360 pounds/acre/day for a five-day detention period.  Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS.
- · FILTER STRIP OPTION: Treatment of effluent by passing it through a constructed or natural filter strip, of appropriate dimensions, prior to discharge to waters of the state is an effective means of reducing effluent pollutants.  A filter strip of vegetated land is utilized and designed such that water will flow in a thin sheet slowly across it. This strip allows for capture of sediment, organic matter and other pollutants by deposition,

infiltration, absorption, decomposition and volatilization.  Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS for assistance.

- · WETLAND TREATMENT OPTION: Discharge of effluent from a detention facility, filter strip or minimal impact facility, implementing the BMPs in this section, into or through constructed wetlands prior to discharge to waters of the state provides an effective and environmentally sound means of providing additional treatment.  Existing facilities previously authorized to discharge into a natural wetland may also utilize this option.
- · INTEGRATED PRODUCTION OPTION: Effluent from aquaculture production units can be reused for the purposes of producing a secondary aquaculture crop, agronomic crops or aquatic plants or combinations thereof. This option allows for numerous design opportunities including water recirculation. This type of practice may provide adequate treatment itself or provide improvements in water quality allowing for a reduction in the scale of effluent treatment infrastructure.  Utilization of this option may require additional treatment prior to discharge to waters of the state. Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS.
- · MECHANICAL AND BIOLOGICAL FILTRATION: For systems culturing filter feeders (corals, shellfish, etc.), effluent from hatchery production systems or nursery systems where feed is added may be treated by implementing a series of mechanical (sand filters, settling screens, filter socks) and biological filtration (macroalgae and/or aquatic plant culture) prior to discharge to waters of the state. Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS prior to construction to discuss plans prior to construction.
- · INJECTION WELL: There are five classes of wells defined in state and federal law that regulate fluid injection below ground surface.  Class V wells include an 'aquaculture' activity within its defined uses and for any salinity. Water from an aquaculture facility can be returned as long as it does not contain hazardous substances, the withdrawal well and return well are cased to prevent mixing with overlying strata(s) of water, and a confining strata separates the receiving strata from potable water.  A monitoring well in the overlying strata, above the confining layer, may be required as well as other Class I injection well standards that are decided on a case-by-case basis. Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS. A permit or variance from FDEP's Underground Injection Control Program must be obtained prior to use of any well to dispose of effluent.
- · RETENTION OPTION OR ZERO SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE: Retention of all production unit effluent on site may be a viable option for certain facilities and can be accomplished by a variety of methods:

- 1. RETENTION, EVAPORATION OR PERCOLATION PONDS - In certain locations, where the soil is highly porous allowing for water infiltration, a treatment pond may be constructed to hold all discharge and allow for percolation. The volume of the pond is determined by the expected quantity of discharge and the evaporation and percolation rate of the soil, as determined by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service soil survey or independent testing.  Under no circumstances are direct discharges, by pipes or other structures, to ground water authorized.  Construction in wellfield protection areas is strongly discouraged, but is not a requirement. Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS.
- 2. FIELD APPLICATION - Effluent must be applied at less than or equal to agronomic rates to a field where there is sustained vegetative cover. Saline water shall not be discharged to freshwater environments.
- 3. SEPTIC SYSTEM - In those situations where the effluent volume and the rate of discharge is determined appropriate by the Division of Aquaculture, a septic system is a suitable option for handling effluent.  Aquaculturists interested in this treatment option should contact FDACS and comply with applicable requirements of the Department of Health and local governments regarding septic systems.

## F. WATER QUALITY ENHANCEMENT PRACTICES

Several management practices when incorporated into the design and facility management can be utilized in conjunction with the treatment options to improve the water quality of effluents. These methods include: 1) aeration within a detention facility to increase dissolved oxygen, volatilization of gases and enhance bacterial oxidation of organic matter; 2) use of biological filtration to enhance the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate (this practice is useful for small volumes of water such as tank production systems); 3) chemical treatments to reduce concentrations of certain parameters of concern, such as the use of alum to reduce turbidity or the addition of beneficial bacteria to enhance oxidation of organic matter (this method may only be effective with extended water residence times); 4) or previously authorized discharges to a natural wetland.

## Best Management Practices:

- · If an excavated pond discharges off site, limit the crop biomass to 1,500 pounds per surface acre or follow the effluent treatment guidelines found in this chapter.
- · If an excavated pond discharges off site, limit feeding to five percent (5%) of biomass per day or follow the effluent treatment guidelines found in this chapter.
- · For all pit pond use relating to aquaculture, submit a facility plan to FDACS, for approval

prior to beginning any construction.  If an excavated pond does not meet the NRCS pond bank slope requirements it shall be considered a 'pit pond'.  USDA NRCS, PondsPlanning, Design, Construction, Agricultural Handbook, Number 590 (November, 1997) is incorporated by reference into Rule 5L-3.004, F.A.C.

- · Pit ponds which penetrate or are directly connected to a Class I drinking water aquifer, as determined by depth of digging relative to the underlying aquifer, are limited to a crop biomass of less than 1,500 pounds per surface acre and a limited daily feeding rate not to exceed 5% of biomass.
- · Pit ponds with a crop biomass of less than 1,500 pounds per surface acre should limit feeding to five percent (5%) of biomass per day.
- · Pit ponds with a crop biomass greater than 1,500 pounds per surface acre or ponds with feeding rates that exceed a five percent (5%) of biomass per day, should:
- · Utilize aerators, pumps, or other effective destratification methods, including limits on pond depth, to eliminate pond stratification.
- · Establish a feeding protocol which eliminates overfeeding.
- · Utilize cage systems which are designed to minimize feed loss and that allow for the collection and removal of waste.  Treatment of removed waste can be accomplished either by in-pond treatment, swale treatment, ditch system treatment, filter strip treatment, wet detention, and/or constructed wetlands, singly or in combination.
- · Single inlet detention facilities must have a length to a width ratio of at least 1:1. Multiinlet detention facilities must maintain at least 100 linear feet between the outlet and inlets.
- · Water quality treatment is to be accomplished via a combination of in-pond treatment, such as described in University of Florida IFAS, Stormwater Detention and Discharge from Aquaculture Ponds in Florida, Publication No. 334, (January, 2015) which is incorporated by reference into Rule 5L-3.004, F.A.C., or utilization of a vegetated filter strip with a minimum 15-minute travel time, or by using wet detention facilities with one or five day residence times based on feeding rates.  For maintenance or harvesting purposes, scheduled pond drawdown(s) shall be accomplished in the following manner:
- · Ponds should be drained for harvesting and maintenance only as necessary.
- · Ponds should be drained during the dry season when possible.
- · For maintenance or harvesting purposes, scheduled pond drawdown(s) should be

routed to existing on site surface water management facilities, dry pond cells, filter strips via a pulsed dry season discharge, to adjacent crops at the proper agronomic rate, or distributed to adjacent ponds.

- · Routinely maintain pond/dike facilities to minimize seepage and to maintain the integrity of the structure.
- · Control the rate and timing of discharge to assure the flow into surface waters and wetlands will mimic predevelopment flow patterns.
- · Plant nurseries must follow all applicable BMPs including fertilizer recommendations referred to in the Aquatic Plants Chapter.
- · Debris removed from retention structures shall be disposed of pursuant to local rules and/or ordinances.
- · Plastic from greenhouses and/or freeze protection materials shall be disposed of pursuant to Section 823.145, F.S., or local regulations.

In lieu of the preceding effluent treatment BMPs, an aquaculture facility, at their option, may choose to be permitted pursuant to Part IV of Chapter 373 and/or NPDES permitting.

## G. DUAL USE OF PERMITTED STORMWATER TREATMENT PONDS

Although not encouraged, agricultural operators may look to diversify their business by the use of previously permitted stormwater treatment ponds.  These 'ponds' may have been permitted by a regional Water Management District or FDEP.   These permitted ponds may have been approved as part of a Management and Storage of Surface Waters (MSSW) Permit or an Environmental Resource Permit (ERP). FDACS does not recommend the use of stormwater treatment ponds for commercial food fish production.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Modify existing MSSW/62-25 or ERP permits prior to utilizing stormwater treatment ponds for aquaculture production.
- · Review the permitting history of the existing pond(s) and ascertain any special permitting conditions which may preclude the use of the pond for aquaculture.
- · Limit crop biomass to a maximum of 1,500 pounds per surface acre and feeding to a maximum of five percent of biomass per day.
- · Where stormwater ponds have been constructed for water quality treatment and nutrient uptake, aquaculturists should avoid adding feed to these ponds.
- · No feed may be added to stormwater ponds that discharge off the farm.

## V. CONSTRUCTION

Agricultural Lands and Practices, Chapter 163.3162, F.S., addresses duplicative regulations between state and local government and provides precedence for agricultural operations regulated through Best Management Practices adopted by FDACS.  However, predominately urbanized counties with a population greater than 1,500,000 and more than 25 municipalities may have a delegated pollution control program that prevails.

## A. NEW CONSTRUCTION

Individuals and/or companies constructing facilities on new farms or expanding current facilities must follow this section as well as all other applicable BMPs.  This section provides a certificate holder with a mechanism that identifies a new aquaculture operation as an agriculture enterprise in the development phase with the final objective being commercial aquaculture production. Construction timeline deviations shall be submitted to the Division. Failure to meet the development expectations of the given requirements will result in non-issuance or cancellation of the aquaculture certification and subsequent referral to all other appropriate regulatory agencies.

## Best Management Practices:

- · A new farm or facility application for an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration must contain the following:
- (a) Applicant's name/title.
- (b) Company name.
- (c) Complete mailing address.
- (d) Legal property description for aquaculture facility.
- (e) Actual physical street address for aquaculture facility.
- (f) Detailed description of production facilities, including a construction plan, sketch and associated timeline.
- (g) Detailed species production plan and associated timeline (i.e. stocking/harvest dates, projected production, etc.).
- (h) Description detailing implementation of appropriate BMPs.  (See XX Appendix for a species and system cross reference guide.)
- (i) One Hundred dollar ($100) annual registration fee.
- (j) A copy of a current shellfish harvester education training certificate (required for all Aquaculture Certificates of Registration listing clams, mussels, scallops, or oysters as products).
- · Construction must adhere to the requirements of Chapter V of the Aquaculture Best Management Practices Manual.
- · As provided in Chapter V, Section C, Aquaculture Best Management Practices, wetlands shall not be impacted.

- · Supporting documentation to substantiate the above requirements must be maintained by the applicant and available for review upon request by FDACS.
- · During the construction phase a certificate holder will be subject to unannounced inspections, one of which will be prior to the issuance of an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration, to confirm compliance with all applicable BMPs and completion of construction/production timelines.
- · FDACS may grant a time extension to complete construction provided the applicant requests, in writing, an extension with sufficient and plausible detail explaining circumstances necessitating an extension.
- · Aquaculturists proposing new construction of nonresidential farm buildings, as defined in Section 604.50(2)(d), F.S., on property located within the boundaries detailed in a military installation compatibility plan must comply with the military installation compatibility requirements of Section 163.3175, F.S.

## B.  AQUACULTURE POND RECLAMATION

Existing certified aquaculture facilities may reclaim constructed ponds to allow for alternative non aquaculture land use activities.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Reclamation processes must follow all aquaculture erosion control best management practices.
- · Existing berms and/or dikes may be used to fill ponds so long as there is no change to existing offsite water flow patterns.
- · Fill materials from offsite may be utilized so long as the fill material is clean and free of debris and waste.
- · The reclamation process is intended to return the site as near as feasible to its original topography.
- · Once the reclamation process is completed any non-aquaculture activity or construction must be permitted/authorized by the appropriate state and/or local regulatory agency(s).

## C.  WETLANDS PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION

Wetlands are important components of Florida's water resources. They provide spawning areas and nurseries for many species of fish and wildlife, flood water storage, uptake of nutrients in runoff water, habitat for plant and animal biodiversity, and recreational opportunities for the public.  Wetlands are complex transitional ecosystems between aquatic and terrestrial

environments.  Prior to development, Florida's wetlands (including open waters and seasonally flooded areas) covered about half of the state's area.  That area has been greatly reduced primarily due to early water management efforts focused on draining wetlands to facilitate development interests and augmentation of agricultural lands.  Today, landowners may qualify for various USDA NRCS incentive programs designed to encourage wetland restoration. Contact FDACS or USDA for additional information.

Wetlands may exist as isolated features in the landscape or may be connected to surface water bodies such as rivers, streams, lakes and often have no discernable shoreline.  A goal of the Aquaculture Best Management Practices Manual is to protect wetlands from adverse impacts associated with dredging, filling, hydro-period alteration, expansion or reduction of watersheds, or water quality degradation. DO NOT CONDUCT DREDGE OR FILL ACTIVITIES IN WETLANDS OR WETLAND BUFFERS . If plans include the construction of sea walls, bulkheads, beach armoring or similar structures, the following wetland BMPs do not apply. Please contact the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for authorization to construct these structures.  It is the intent of this manual to employ BMPs which do not adversely affect on site (project area) or offsite wetlands.  As such, all proposed aquacultural operation designs must first consider elimination and/or reduction of wetland impacts through practicable design alternatives or modifications.  Aquacultural operations unable or unwilling to follow this wetland BMP must obtain applicable permits under Part IV of Chapter 373, F.S.

Note: Wetlands constructed (man-made) for water treatment purposes are not subject to this wetland BMP.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Contact FDACS to confirm the presence or absence of onsite and adjacent wetlands prior to initiating any aquaculture construction activities.
- · All new pond construction must maintain a minimum 50-foot upland buffer from the boundary of all wetlands and or natural water bodies. Fill material shall not be placed in the 50-foot buffer.
- · If production exceeds 10,000 pounds/year, do not discharge untreated effluents into wetlands.

Prior to construction of any land-based effluent treatment system (i.e., filter strip) ultimately discharging to surface waters, the determination of the landward extent of any receiving water must be made or verified by FDACS.  This determination is necessary to prevent the location or inclusion of water treatment facilities in wetlands or other surface waters pursuant to Rule Chapter 62-340, F.A.C., or waters of the United States.

## D. FLOODPLAIN ISSUES

Floodplains are typically dry or semi-dry areas around rivers, lakes and near the coast, where water can overflow or pond for extended periods as a result of seasonal rainfalls. Flooding is a natural phenomenon and occurs when the amount of water flowing into an area exceeds the land's ability to store and convey the water.  Aquaculture facilities must be designed to reasonably prevent an increase in flooding of adjacent properties both up gradient and down gradient of the proposed aquacultural activity.  Flood information can be obtained from the local county planning and zoning office or by contacting FDACS.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Prior to any new construction within the 100-year flood zone, submit a facility plan to FDACS.

## E. EROSION CONTROL GUIDELINES

During the construction phase of your project, care must be taken to prevent or control erosion, sediment deposition, turbidity and other potential adverse effects to water quality due to increased runoff rates downstream from your facility.  Sediment loads to aquatic environments can block waterways, kill aquatic plants and reduce oxygen levels.  Sediments from stormwater runoff may also be associated with the transport of unwanted chemicals and nutrients to aquatic environments. Be sure to obtain all applicable construction, zoning and consumptive water use permits before site clearing and construction commence.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Select a site where the natural drainage patterns can be incorporated into the facility design to move water more effectively while avoiding 'in stream' construction.
- · Where it is necessary to modify the natural onsite drainage patterns use swales and/or berms to direct surface water flow through, or around your property in order to maintain natural off site drainage patterns.  Criteria for these and other surface water control techniques can be obtained from the local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) office.
- · Stabilize exposed soils to prevent erosion and use silt barriers around wetlands and other surface waters to prevent inadvertent filling by sedimentation.
- · Terrain alterations are permitted so long as the alterations do not cause an increase in offsite silting or flooding.  Acceptable alterations include, but are not limited to, removal of trees, vines, bushes, and other vegetative ground cover.  Any standard agricultural practice may be utilized such as, but not limited to, mowing, disking, plowing, and dragging, in addition to tree cutting and stump removal.

- · Use recommended methods (USDA NRCS Conservation Practice Standard, Conservation Cover, Code 327, (October, 2011)), which is incorporated by reference into Rule 5L3.004, F.A.C.) to reduce surface water velocity in order to prevent erosion, and to promote the removal of suspended solids.

## F. WATER ATTENUATION CRITERIA

As authorized by Florida Law, aquaculture BMPs replace the existing pertinent industrial wastewater requirements under Chapter 403, F.S., and the existing pertinent Environmental Resource Permits requirements under Chapter 373, Part IV, F.S.

## G. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Florida receives an average 50" of rainfall from about 120 storms a year.  Given the intensity and frequency of these storms, the resulting stormwater runoff can present a risk to sensitive downstream receiving water bodies both in terms of its potential to transport pollutants (natural or synthetic) from the land and in the volume/rate of discharge.  Of primary importance is the so-called 'first flush.'  This term describes the washing action that stormwater has on accumulated pollutants in a watershed.  Studies in Florida have determined that the first one-inch of runoff generally carries 90% of pollutants released by virtue of the storm induced discharge.

Before you settle on a final design for your facility, consider the following issues and the impact each may have on your design and the impact your design may have on your site and on surrounding properties.

- · Where and how much water flows onto your property?
- · Where and how much water flows off your property?
- · What are the predominant soil types on your property?
- · Are your soils susceptible to excessive runoff?
- · How much new impervious surface are you adding to your operation/property?
- · Will the proposed activity significantly increase or decrease the flow and timing off your property?

## Best Management Practices:

- · Where appropriate, incorporate into the final design any design modifications, features necessary to minimize the potential impacts of commingling surface water and production water.
- · Know your operation - knowledge of the composition of your production water effluent, utilization of other water quality BMPs described and enumerated in this manual, and knowledge of local rainfall patterns will benefit your operation in terms of design efficiency.

- · For all construction activities which will cumulatively create more than two acres of impervious surface, the facility must provide a stormwater treatment holding capacity of 24-hours for the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event.  Production pond water surface area is not considered impervious. For assistance in determining the required holding capacity, contact FDACS or consult a stormwater engineer.
- · Construction that cumulatively results in 5% or more impervious surface, which is greater than two acres, must include an analysis by a State of Florida licensed Professional Engineer to demonstrate that there will be no adverse downstream impacts. (Production pond water surface area is not considered impervious.)

## H. EXCAVATED PONDS

## Best Management Practices:

- · Ponds must be constructed in accordance with the USDA-NRCS Field Office or IFAS guidelines (USDA NRCS, Ponds - Planning, Design, Construction Agriculture Handbook, Number 590 (November, 1997) or USDA NRCS, Conservation Practice Standard, Aquaculture Ponds, Code 397 (June, 2004) which is incorporated by reference into Rule 5L-3.004, F.A.C.) or a department approved design and shall maintain a minimum one-foot of freeboard.
- · Fill may not be removed from the property unless permitted pursuant to local regulations. Documentation must be on file for the facility for the duration of active construction and plans shall fully describe the amount of fill to be removed from the property.
- · Ponds should typically be constructed with no discharge; ponds which are designed to discharge or could be expected to discharge should demonstrate the ability to follow the Effluent Treatment BMPs.
- · Remove trees, stumps, and brush which may undermine the integrity of berms and dams.
- · Where necessary, design and install upland excavated sediment sumps landward of wetland buffers to minimize scouring and sediment transport.
- · Use spreader swales and other functionally equivalent devices to create sheet flow when discharging into wetlands.
- Maintain existing watersheds and point(s) of discharge during pre and post development conditions.
- · Submit a facility plan to FDACS for approval prior to beginning any construction.

## I. WATERSHED PONDS

In hilly terrain, aquaculturists may take advantage of runoff from rainfall within the watershed.  Watershed to pond surface acreage ratios vary from site to site, with soil types being the determining factor.  When ponds are built in series, less water is required for maintenance, and the last pond in the series may be used for one (1) day production water treatment. Supply water for aquaculture watershed fish production ponds typically comes from watershed runoff and springs, but ground water wells can serve as supplementary water supplies, provided that applicable consumptive use permits are obtained.  Because each site will have specific requirements, the aquaculturist must submit a facility plan to FDACS for approval prior to beginning any construction.  Some options to consider in the planning process are:

- · Create harvest and access areas during pond construction.
- · Utilize cage culture where ponds are deep and/or irregular shaped.
- · Determine the potential for impact upon surrounding property and historical water flow rates and design the facility to eliminate adverse impacts.
- · Determine if impounded water poses a safety hazard to downgrade residents and/or property and design the facility to eliminate any safety hazards.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Submit a facility plan to FDACS for approval prior to beginning any construction.
- · Follow recommended USDA NRCS, Ponds - Planning, Design and Construction, Agriculture Handbook, Number 590 (November, 1997) and Southern Regional Aquaculture Center, Watershed Fish Production Ponds: Guide to Site Selection and Construction, SRAC Publication No. 102 (September, 2002) which is incorporated by reference into Rule 5L-3.004, F.A.C.
- · Provide erosion controls.
- · Stabilize pond banks during construction.
- · Remove all undesirable trees, stumps, and brush which may hinder harvest activities or undermine the integrity of berms and dams, or create safety hazards.
- · When utilizing drain-harvesting, construct catch basins and holding structures at the drain intake or outfall.
- · Avoid digging a pond that penetrates a Class I drinking water aquifer.

- · If a pond penetrates a Class I drinking water aquifer, the applicant will be limited to less than 1,500 pounds per surface acre stocking density and daily feeding rates not to exceed 5% of biomass.  The pounds per surface acre are determined by multiplying the known fish population by the average fish weight and dividing that number by the total surface acres.
- · For embankment and/or excavated ponds, initial stocking density shall be a minimum of 1,000 fish or 1,000 pounds of fish per surface acre.

## J. PIT PONDS

Rock, sand and phosphate mining operations throughout Florida have resulted in the construction of thousands of 'pit' ponds in Florida.  These pits are very common in southern Florida where large quantities of fill material have been excavated for use in road construction. These systems may appear to be an inexpensive source of vast quantities of water; however, they also involve significant challenges in terms of animal containment, animal harvest, water quality, and animal health.  Inexperienced culturists often greatly overestimate the production capacity of these systems and fail to recognize the significant disadvantages.  Limitations on biomass are included to minimize eutrophication and associated fluctuations in water quality.  It is important to avoid overfeeding which is costly and can lead to water quality issues.  Adhering to the BMPs outlined in the previous 'Water Resources' section will assist in maintaining water quality and decrease the chance of a catastrophic crop loss due to oxygen depletion.

- · Ponds which do not meet the NRCS pond bank slope requirements shall be considered 'pit ponds'.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Pit ponds with a crop biomass of less than 1,500 pounds per surface acre should limit feeding to five percent (5%) of biomass per day.
- · Pit ponds with a crop biomass greater than 1,500 pounds per surface acre or ponds with feeding rates that exceed a five percent (5%) of biomass per day, should:
- 1. Utilize aerators, pumps, or other effective, destratification methods to prevent pond stratification.
- 2. Establish a feeding protocol which prevents overfeeding.
- 3. Utilize cage systems which minimize feed loss and provide for the collection and removal of waste.  Floating cage technology is encouraged.
- 4. Water quality treatment can be accomplished either by in-pond treatment, swale treatment, ditch system treatment, filter strip treatment, wet detention, and/or constructed wetlands, singly or in combination.

- · Pit ponds which penetrate or are directly connected to a Class I drinking water aquifer, must limit crop biomass to less than 1,500 pounds per surface acre and a limited daily feeding rate not to exceed 5% of biomass.
- · For embankment, excavated, and pit ponds initial stocking density shall be a minimum of 1,000 fish or 1,000 pounds of fish per surface acre.

## K. PIPE PLACEMENT

If pipes are used to discharge water from an aquaculture operation, they should use the following:

## Best Management Practices:

- · Pipes must be placed in a location and in a manner which minimizes environmental and aesthetic impacts.
- · Discharge pipes must be situated to prevent erosion or excessive scouring of the bottom in the receiving waters.

## L. AQUACULTURE DOCKS

This BMP is intended for the construction of aquaculture docks originating on upland property and extending on or over wetlands and other surface waters, including either privatelyheld or sovereignty submerged lands.  Aquaculture-dependent docks are docks used exclusively for aquaculture purposes or private single-family residential docks with dual aquaculture and recreational use by the adjacent upland resident.  To qualify under these provisions, docks must be less than or equal to 2,000 square feet total surface area moor 4 or fewer aquaculture vessels, must be associated with a certified aquaculture facility or activity, and must comply with all applicable BMPs.

Docks larger than 2,000 square feet, moor more than 4 aquaculture vessels, or which cannot meet or follow all of the BMPs listed below must obtain an Environmental Resource Permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or may require an aquaculture submerged lands lease.

For purposes of constructing an aquaculture dock, the term 'natural resources' shall include corals; emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation; mangrove species; coastal and freshwater wetlands; oyster reefs; endangered or threatened species and their designated critical habitat; and, shore or seabird nesting sites.

## VI. CONTAINMENT

A native species is a species within its natural range or natural zone of dispersal, within the range it could or would occupy without direct or indirect introduction by humans. Nonnative species are those species not indigenous or native to a particular area.  Nonnative species identified as Restricted Species below require compliance with additional BMPs and written authorization annually by FDACS to culture these species at a certified facility. Aquaculturists are responsible for preventing the release of all cultured species to the environment. Changes in taxonomic nomenclature do not alter the regulatory status of a species.

Contact FDACS for approval before you import or add new species to your facility to verify facility requirements and the restricted or prohibited status of the organism.  Species not currently in culture in Florida require the following information to be supplied to FDACS for review prior to culture or possession:

- 1) Taxonomic nomenclature
- 2) Planned source of stock
- 3) Biological information and culture history of species
- 4) Facility culture plans (life stage to be obtained, plan to breed or growing out smaller stock for market)
- 5) Containment measures
- 6) Target market (e.g. fry/fingerlings/food/ornamental/live/on ice/filleted/wholesale/retail etc.) Note: Do not provide cost, price, or buyer contact information.

## A. NATIVE SPECIES

## Best Management Practices:

- · All holding, transport, and culture systems at land-based facilities must be designed, operated and maintained to prevent the escape of cultured aquatic species into waters of the state. Any method of containment that will effectively prevent release or escape may be utilized.

## B. NONNATIVE SPECIES CONTAINMENT

## Best Management Practices:

- · All holding, transport, and culture systems must be designed, operated and maintained to prevent the escape of all life stages of nonnative aquatic species into waters of the state. Any method of containment that will effectively prevent nonnative species from being released may be utilized.

- · Written authorization may be required from FDACS and/or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service prior to importing nonnative aquatic species from outside of Florida or the United States.

## Lionfish Best Management Practices:

Although lionfish have never been aquacultured, the following BMPs are designed to limit the number of lionfish in Florida but still allow restricted grow out and sale of individuals legally harvested from Florida waters.

- · The breeding or reproduction of lionfish ( Pterois spp. ) is prohibited regardless of the origin of the broodstock.
- · Lionfish lawfully harvested in Florida waters or from adjacent federal waters pursuant to Rule 68B-5.006, F.A.C., may be possessed and grown out for sale at aquaculture facilities that meet the following containment requirements:
- a. Lionfish cultured outdoors may only be held in culture systems that have the lowest point of the top edge of its levee, dike, bank, or tank at an elevation of at least one foot above the 100-year flood elevation determined by reference to elevation maps  issued  by  the  National Flood  Insurance  Program,  U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Such culture systems shall have no water discharge  or  shall  be  constructed  with  a  barrier  system  designed  to  prevent escape of adults, juveniles, and eggs in effluent water or into effluent treatment areas in the 100-year flood zone.
- b. Lionfish cultured indoors may only be held in culture systems having no water discharge, having a water discharge through a closed drain system, or other system designed to prevent discharge of water containing adults, juveniles and eggs.
- · Any escape or accidental release of lionfish, regardless of life stage, including eggs shall be immediately reported to FDACS.

## C. RESTRICTED NONNATIVE SPECIES CONTAINMENT

The following species require approval prior to culture by obtaining a Restricted Species Authorization from FDACS:

- · Bighead carp ( Aristichthys nobilis )

- · These records must include the date of shipment, name, address, and Aquaculture Certification of Registration number(s) of the supplier and the recipient if purchased or sold in Florida and a copy of the Restricted Species Authorization or Conditional Species Authorization for the buyer.
- · Records must be retained by the hatchery or farm and available for inspection for at least two years from the transaction.
- · Written authorization must be obtained annually from FDACS to possess restricted nonnative species.  Restricted species authorizations issued by FDACS expire on June 30 of each year and must be renewed annually.  Any facility failing to maintain an active Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and restricted species authorization must legally and humanely dispose of any restricted species within their possession.  Failure to do will result in referral to FWC.
- · Restricted species may be taken on a fee or for-hire basis using hook and line or rod and reel so long as anglers are accompanied by an AQ facility representative, and no live restricted animals leave the facility unless that angler possesses a Restricted Species Authorization or Conditional Species Authorization for the restricted species.

The following Restricted species have additional aquaculture criteria as listed below:

- · Nile perches (Genus Lates , all species including barramundi) a) For owners of aquaculture facilities that are operating under permit or a certificate of registration, but which are not cultivating Nile perches as of April 11, 2007, and for owners of aquaculture facilities which are issued

original permits or certificates of registration after April 11, 2007, Nile perches shall be held only in indoor facilities and shall not be taken on a fee or for-hire basis using hook and line or rod and reel.

- b) Facilities must be constructed to prevent the release of animals during a disaster.
- c) Culture systems shall have no outdoor water discharge.

## D. ALTERNATIVE CONTAINMENT PRACTICES

Any system may be utilized as long as it meets the containment requirements above

- · No discharge or zero discharge production systems are designed to ensure that water from the production unit is not discharged from the facility.  This includes design parameters and management practices to ensure that stormwater does not cause the system to discharge.

- · Screened discharge systems utilizing screen or filter devices at the point of production unit discharge or at the point of discharge from the operation or effluent treatment facility (such as a detention or retention pond). A screen or filter device must be sized so as to retain the smallest size fish or egg.  Examples of screened/filter systems include a series (multiples are used to ensure at least one screen is in place while others are cleaned) of mesh screens capable of screening all water, a dry bed filter constructed with gravel and sand to trap eggs and fish, a commercially available micro screen solids filter, or a pond trap with screened discharge.
- · Disinfection or sterilization techniques such as ultraviolet light (UV), ozone or chlorine may be utilized in conjunction with the above mentioned methods to ensure that live organisms do not escape the facility.
- · Use of biological controls (e.g., stocking detention ponds with native predatory fish such as largemouth bass).

## E. PROHIBITED SPECIES

Best Management Practice:

- · Anytime a prohibited species is discovered at a certified facility without FWC authorization via a permit, it is to be immediately euthanized and properly disposed of.

## Prohibited aquatic species are not eligible for possession or culture in Florida.

- 1) after all requested information is provided;
- 2) after the Department has reviewed all other information that has been submitted by the public; and
- 3) if upon review of all the foregoing it can be determined that authorization will not pose a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare.
- · Certified aquaculturists must adhere to all stipulations required in the FDACS written letter of authorization.

## VII. MARINE NET PENS AND CAGES

Net pens and cages are submerged, suspended, floating or other holding systems that utilize a netting (fiber or metal) to contain and culture marine fish or crustaceans. This chapter pertains only to the operation of net pens or cages (hereinafter referred to as 'net pens') that are located in the marine waters of the State of Florida.

Net pen operations must acquire: 1) an annual Aquaculture Certificate of Registration; 2) a sovereignty submerged land and water column lease; and 3) if the aquaculture facility produces more than 100,000 pounds of live weight product annually, a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.  Bivalve molluscs (clams, mussels, scallops or oysters) being produced for sale as food for human consumption can only be cultured within the boundaries of state managed Shellfish Harvesting Areas.  Contact FDACS for Aquaculture Certificate of Registration, sovereignty submerged land and water column lease, and shellfish harvest area, harvesting, and processing information. Contact the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Industrial Wastewater Program, for NPDES permit information.

Net pen operators who do not operate their aquaculture facilities in compliance with the sovereignty submerged land and water column lease conditions and this Aquaculture Best Management Practices Manual risk the revocation of the lease instrument and/or Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and enforcement action including administrative fines.

## A. SITE SELECTION

Appropriate site selection for net pens is critical for the minimization of potential environmental impacts, and optimal fish health and performance. Wise site selection has significant potential to reduce the risk of net pen environmental impacts. With the exception of site selection, net pen farm operators have little ability to control the environmental conditions their fish may experience.  Sites with frequent, extreme weather or sea-state conditions that would limit the grower's access to the farm site and cultured animals should be reconsidered. Harmful algal blooms (i.e., red tide) are common in Florida waters.  Net pen operators should investigate red tide history for the location that they are considering.

In addition to BMP compliance, the Division of Aquaculture will review Aquaculture Certificate of Registration applications based upon their relative distance to other net pens that may be in the area to assess potential cumulative environmental impacts.  The number of net pens or their configuration in certain marine environments may require additional environmental, farm design or production information from the applicant to determine potential cumulative environmental impacts.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Evaluate each potential farm site to ensure that environmental conditions on the farm site are appropriate for the species being considered for culture and the equipment proposed for use.

- · A Farm Site Plan that maps the location of the net pens, anchoring, and feeding systems must be submitted with an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration application to FDACS. Net pens and anchors must be mapped using Global Positioning System (GPS) or latitude/longitude coordinates. The Farm Site Plan must be maintained, updated and made available for review by FDACS personnel during compliance inspections.
- · Select sites with good water exchange, sufficient depth, and adequate current velocity.
- · Sites must have a sand or mud bottom.
- · Sites for polyculture of finfish and filter-feeding shellfish (mussels, clams, oysters or scallops) can only occur in Shellfish Harvesting Areas classified and managed by FDACS.  This is not a requirement where shellfish are being used solely for the ecological benefits they provide and will not be sold as a food product.
- · Contact FDACS for information about shellfish harvest areas, harvesting, and processing.

## B. FEED MANAGEMENT

Waste feed and fish feces constitute most of the wastes generated by a net pen farm.  An effective way to reduce the potential environmental impact of net pens is to aggressively and proactively manage feed selection, distribution and utilization.

Effective feed management is based on two components: waste reduction and optimal feed conversion ratio.  Waste reduction focuses on ensuring that feed used by the farm is not lost or discharged prior to intake by the fish.  Optimal conversion focuses on ensuring that all feed offered to the fish is actually consumed, digested, and utilized.  Monitoring long- and short-term changes in feed conversion ratios allows farmers to quickly identify significant changes in feed consumption and waste production rates in individual net pens.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Operate feed storage, handling, and delivery methods to minimize waste and the creation of fine particles of feed.
- · Maintain feed conversion ratio records by using feed and fish biomass inventory tracking systems.
- · Minimize nutrient and solids discharges through optimization of efficient feed formulations.  Use formulations designed to enhance nitrogen and phosphorus retention efficiency, and reduce metabolic waste output.
- · Feed manufacturer labels, or copies thereof, must be retained for the prior two years of operation.  Labels must be made available for review by FDACS personnel during

compliance inspections.

- · Use efficient feeding practices, monitor active feed consumption, and reduce feed loss. The appropriate quantity and type of feed for a given species is influenced by fish size, water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, health status, reproductive status, and management goals.  Feed particle size should be appropriate for the size of fish being fed. Feeding behavior must be observed to monitor feed utilization and evaluate health status.
- · Maintain and properly operate feeding equipment.
- · Feeding at slack tide is prohibited.
- · Conduct employee training in fish husbandry and feeding methods to ensure that workers have adequate training to optimize feed conversion ratios.
- · Wherever practical, interactive feedback feeding systems such as video, 'lift-ups,' Doppler, sonar, infrared, or equivalent methods should be used to monitor feed consumption, and reduce feed waste.
- · Color video or still photographic surveys will be conducted twice per year (January 1 and June 30) of the sea floor under and adjacent to each net pen on a 100 meter transect up the prevailing current from the edge of the net and 100 meters down the prevailing current from the edge of the net pen to determine solids loadings and whether eutrophication of the local environment is occurring as a result of food loss and fish excretion.  Monitoring will include recording the date(s) on which monitoring was conducted, a site schematic of the video track(s) or still photos in relation to the net pen, and Global Positioning System (GPS) locations of the beginning and end points for the transects.  The video survey shall be continuous.  Still photographs shall be taken at least every 5 meters.  The video or photographic survey will document sediment type and color as well as features such as erosional and depositional areas, flora and fauna and their relative abundance, feed pellets, and any other manmade debris.  Images shall be of sufficient detail and clarity to allow for the accurate assessment of benthic conditions. The camera must be positioned at a height above the substrate that will provide approximately one square meter of bottom coverage and illuminated with sufficient artificial light to enable the accurate identification of epibenthic organisms and sediment conditions.  A brief written narrative with the tape or photographs describing current speed and direction and reference points shall be included.  The tape or photographs with narrative will be submitted to FDACS within 60 days of the survey completion.
- · The feeding of wet feeds (ground or whole fish or shellfish and other raw meat or plant materials) is prohibited.
- · Physical disturbance of the bottom such as harrowing, dragging or other mechanical means shall not be used to mitigate the benthic impacts of feed or fish excretion.

## C. SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL

Sources of solid waste include biofouling organisms that colonize nets, mortalities, feedbags, packaging materials, scrap rope and netting, worn or broken net pen structural components, and other miscellaneous items.  Net pen operators must make every effort to collect and properly dispose of solid waste.

Proper fish health management is the best means for reducing costly mortalities in net pens.  Optimizing fish health will reduce the need to deal with dead fish.  Even under optimal conditions some mortality will occur.  Net pens, by their very design, contain and collect mortalities and this result facilitates mortality monitoring and their timely removal.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Develop a Solid Waste Management plan. This plan must identify all wastes generated on a site or from an aquaculture facility.  The Solid Waste Management Plan must be submitted with an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration application and maintained, implemented, and made available, upon request, to FDACS personnel.  At a minimum, waste management plans must address:

Human waste Feedbags Scrap rope Scrap netting Buoys and weights Fish mortalities Spoiled feed Packaging materials Fouling organisms Any other solid waste

- · Mortalities will attract predators and contribute to fish health problems. Mortalities must be collected regularly and as frequently as possible (weather permitting) to avoid accumulation at the net pen bottom.
- · Farmers must use collection and removal methods that do not stress remaining animals or compromise net integrity.  Mortalities must be stored and transported in closed containers with tight fitting lids.  Mortalities must be returned to shore, disposed of and notification given in accordance with Chapter XV, Disposal of Dead Animals.
- · Farmers must avoid the discharge of substances associated with in-place net cleaning. Implement gear and management strategies to reduce biofouling that will minimize or eliminate the need for onsite net cleaning.  Strategies may include, but not be limited to: stocking mullet ( Mugil spp. ), sheepshead ( Archosargus probatocephalus ), or similar

- native species in the net pen to biologically control fouling, use of fouling resistant materials (e.g., copper alloy netting), net changing, rotating cage designs, or the application of antifoulant coatings.
- · Onsite mechanical cleaning must include methods to prevent the accumulation of solids on the sea floor or the release of solids that cause or contribute to water quality impairment.
- · The use of biocidal chemicals for cleaning nets on site is prohibited.
- · Copies of antifoulant coating product labels must be provided to FDACS prior to use. Antifoulant coating use and restrictions as described in Chapter 376, Pollutant Discharge Prevention and Removal, F.S.; Chapter 487, Pesticide Regulation and Safety, F.S.; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, Title 7, Chapter 6, Code of Federal Regulations; and Organotin Antifouling Paint Control Act, Title 33, Chapter 37, Code of Federal Regulations must be followed.  The use of organotin or petroleum based antifoulant products such as creosote, oils, bitumen, coal tar, or greases are prohibited.
- · All feed bags, spoiled feed, packaging materials, waste rope and netting, or worn structural components must be collected, returned to shore and disposed of properly. Recycling is strongly encouraged.

## D. ESCAPE MANAGEMENT

The escape of cultured species may pose a variety of potential risks to marine species and ecosystems or unrelated economic activities. Three effective ways to reduce potential environmental impacts by escapees are prevention, genetic compatibility or genetic isolation.

Prevention involves proactively reducing the potential causes of escape.  Escape risks associated with net pen aquaculture in areas inhabited by large number of sharks is high and the success of the operation will depend on the implementation of efficient yet passive and environmentally-sound methods of predator deterrence.  In tropical and subtropical waters all over the world, sharks attack dead fish that sink to the bottom of net pens.  Shark attacks can tear holes into the netting that are large enough to allow fish to escape.  Sharks are common in Florida waters.  For these reasons, efficient methods of predator control such as anti-predator netting are required. Escape response actions such as mortality removal, net repair and animal recovery plans, will help mitigate the impact of escapes.  All net pen farm operators must continuously strive to reduce escape risk through net pen maintenance and frequent net pen structural monitoring.

Genetic compatibility can be achieved through implementation of the following BMPs and consultation with FDACS.  Genetic isolation is accomplished by using sterile stock or strains that are unable to interbreed with wild fish or unlikely to survive in the wild.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Net pen culture of species not native to Florida waters or transgenic species is prohibited.
- · Net pen facilities must maintain documentation identifying the source of all eggs, fry, fingerlings or adult fish for at least two years.  These records must be available for inspection by FDACS staff upon request.
- · If genetic studies are not available that indicate broodstock are genetically similar to and originate from the same genetic stock as conspecific wild animals in the net pen locality, the following requirements for broodstock animals apply: 1) broodstock must originate from waters of the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River outflow to produce juveniles for stocking net pens in state waters of the Gulf or broodstock must originate from waters of the Atlantic Ocean to produce juveniles for stocking net pens located in state waters of the Atlantic and, 2) broodstock for pelagic species may only be collected within a 300 kilometer (186 mile) radius distance from the net pen site or broodstock for estuarine species may only be collected within a 100 kilometer (62 mile) radius distance from the net pen site.
- · Obtain a Special Activity License from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for the collection of wild broodstock pursuant to Rule Chapter 68B-8, F.A.C., Marine Special Activity License Program.
- · The intentional release of fish or shellfish to state waters beyond the confines of the net pens is prohibited unless a Special Activity License from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has been obtained pursuant to Rule Chapter 68B-8, F.A.C., Marine Special Activity License Program.
- · Loss-Control and Escape Recovery Plan must be submitted with an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration application and maintained, implemented and made available to FDACS personnel during compliance inspections.  Plans must include a site-specific analysis of the potential risks of escapes, their causes, and the specific procedures employed by the farm to reduce risk. Loss-control plans must be designed to address the principle causes of escape (equipment failure, operational errors, and predator attacks) and must include: 1) minimum equipment and operating standards; 2) emergency repair procedures; 3) escape recovery procedures; 4) practices and equipment that reduce the need for predator reduction/destruction (i.e., anti-predator nets or equivalent equipment); and (5) preparations for severe weather (i.e., hurricanes).  The Loss Control and Escape Recovery Plan must include a notification procedure to inform FDACS when fish are not recovered following an escape.
- · The facility manager or designated representative will report, within 24 hours, any escape to FDACS. The report must include species identification, approximate size and number of fish, and location.

- · Fish transfers such as stocking, grading, transfer, or harvest must be conducted in appropriate weather conditions and under constant visual supervision.  Equipment appropriate to the weather and net pen or cage designs must be used.  Where necessary or appropriate, shields or additional netting must be used to prevent stray fish from escaping during transfer.
- · All holding, transportation, and culture systems must be designed, operated and maintained to prevent escape. Implement Chapter XVII Shipment, Transportation and Sale.
- · All nets in use must be made from ultraviolet light stabilized compounds.
- · Net pen design, specification, and installation must be commensurate with the prevailing conditions and capable of withstanding the maximum weather and sea conditions prevailing at the site.  A written statement from the net pen manufacturer certifying that net pen(s) have been assembled and moored to their specifications must be available to FDACS personnel during compliance inspections.
- · To prevent fish from jumping out of the primary containment nets, surface net pens must have jump nets installed that are an appropriate height for the species being cultured.
- · Nets must be secured to the cage collar such that the collar bears the strain and not the handrail of the net pen.
- · Net weights, when used, must be installed to prevent chafing. A second layer of net must be added one foot above and below wear points. The use of weight rings is recommended at appropriate sites.
- · A Net Pen Structure and Mooring System Preventative Maintenance Program must be submitted with an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration application and maintained, updated, implemented and made available to FDACS personnel during compliance inspections. The program must have the ability to: 1) identify individual nets, net pen structures, mooring systems and 2) schedule and document regular maintenance and testing.  Nets or net pen structural components that fail testing standards must be retired and disposed of properly.  The program must document regular maintenance and repair: the nature of the maintenance or repair, date conducted, any supporting documentation for new materials used, and the identity of the individuals or firms that conducted the maintenance.
- · Mooring system designs must be compatible with the cage systems they secure. Mooring systems must be installed in consultation with the net pen manufacturer or supplier.  Mooring system design, specification and installation must be commensurate with the prevailing conditions and capable of withstanding the maximum weather and sea

conditions prevailing at the site.  A mooring system schematic must be included and updated as a component of the Farm Site Plan.  Design maximums must be recorded in the Net Pen Structure and Mooring System Preventative Maintenance Program.

- · Facility operators must inspect and adjust mooring systems on a biannual basis and prior to and immediately following a tropical storm or hurricane. New components must undergo their first inspection no later than six months after deployment.  A diver or remote camera must regularly and visually inspect subsurface mooring components. Special attention must be given to connectors and rope/chain interfaces. Chafe points must be identified, inspected, and biofouling removed.  With the exception of anchors, mooring systems must be hauled out of the water for a visual inspection of all components at least every five years.  When considering what inspection method to employ, net pen operators must consider the relative risks and benefits associated with the inspection method.
- · Shackles used in mooring systems must be either safety shackled, wire-tied, or welded to prevent pin drop-out.
- · Where appropriate, bird nets must be used to cover net pens in order to reduce the risk of escape due to bird predation.  Bird nets must be constructed using appropriate materials and mesh sizes designed to reduce the risk of bird entanglement.  Implement Chapter XVI Preventing Wildlife Depredation.
- · Develop a service vessel Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Vessel operations around a net pen site can cause escapes. All vessel operators must receive appropriate training in the operation of the vessel. The service vessel SOP must be made available to FDACS prior to compliance visits.

## E. AQUACULTURE FACILITY OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

Net pen farms are expensive to install and operate.  Operators are subject to elevated public scrutiny because they are located in and actively utilize public waters.  Net pen farms operate in these public waters under the provisions of sovereignty submerged land and water column lease instruments and an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration that can be revoked by the State of Florida.  Net pen operators who do not operate their facilities in compliance with lease conditions and the Aquaculture Best Management Practices Manual directly jeopardize their investment and risk the revocation of the lease instrument and/or Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and enforcement action including administrative fines.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Farmers must conduct annual, systematic reviews of their operations and provide those reviews to FDACS personnel during compliance inspections.

- · When considering modifications to existing farming practices, procedures or structures, growers must conduct a review of the type and extent of probable environmental impacts that may occur as a result of the new methods and amend their existing operational practices to mitigate potential impacts.
- · When conducting activities such as stocking/seeding, harvesting, feeding, grading, thinning, transfer, cleaning, gear maintenance or fallowing, all standard operating procedures must include diligent efforts to minimize probable environmental impacts.
- · Comprehensive stocking and production strategies that optimize production while minimizing environmental impacts must be used.  Production planning must include a systematic review of any probable and cumulative environmental impacts that would be associated with a particular production plan or method.
- · Nets and moorings must be maintained in a whole and intact condition.  No gear may be abandoned.  Storage of nets or gear on the bottom is prohibited.  Any net or gear accidentally dropped or lost during storm events that is not recovered immediately shall be tagged with a float, positioned using differential Global Positioning System, and reported to FDACS within 24 hours.  The lost net or gear shall be recovered within 30 days of the date lost.  FDACS shall be notified on the date the net or gear is recovered.
- · Nets, mooring and rigging lines, and anti-predator equipment must be stretched tight and held taut and maintained in a manner to diminish the likelihood of entangling finfish, decapod crustaceans, sea birds, marine mammals, and sea turtles.
- · Maintain and make available to FDACS, upon request, a Marine Entanglement Log for finfish, decapod crustaceans, sea birds, marine mammals, and sea turtles.  The Log should identify the species, size, number, date of entanglement, and disposition of the species.
- · Consider potential impacts on water circulation patterns when installing net pens and their associated mooring systems.  Gear deployment must optimize circulation patterns and maximize water exchange through the pens, thereby improving fish health and reducing benthic impacts.
- · Design and operate harvest procedures and equipment in a fashion that reduces any associated discharges.  Harvest and post-harvest vessel and equipment clean-up procedures must minimize wastes discharged overboard.
- · Farm support vessels must be fueled at licensed fueling stations.
- · All fuel or oil spills must be reported as required by law to the appropriate state and federal authorities.  Appropriate clean-up and repair actions must be initiated as soon as possible.

- · Farm support vessels of the appropriate size must have approved Marine Sanitation Devices (MSD) on board.  All human wastes must be disposed of according to applicable state and federal regulations.

## F. HEALTH MANAGEMENT

Aquatic animal health management involves proactively managing culture species, pathogens and the environment to optimize conditions for growth and health. Strategies to prevent and/or mitigate risk factors which adversely impact animal health are critical for effective health management.  Open water systems, such as net pens or lease sites present a concern for the exposure of pathogens, both to and from wild animals.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Identify pathogens and non-infectious issues of concern for species being cultured and develop strategies to mitigate the risk.
- · Net pen facilities must maintain documentation identifying the source of all eggs, fry, fingerlings or adults.
- · All stocking of live aquatic organisms, regardless of life stage, must be accompanied by an Official Certificate of Veterinary Inspection signed by a licensed and accredited veterinarian attesting to the health of the organisms to be stocked.
- · Minimize cross-contamination between groups/lots of organisms through cleaning and disinfection of equipment and biosecurity practices.
- · Implement quarantine/isolation or disinfection procedures to reduce the risk of pathogen translocation.
- · Facilities must notify their aquatic animal health professional and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS), Division of Animal Industry, State Veterinarian's Office in the event of a suspected or diagnosed outbreak of a State or Federal notifiable disease or pathogen at (850) 410-0900, or after hours at 1-800-3425869, or by email at RAD@FDACS.gov.
- · Health management records must be a component of the farm records and include behavioral changes, other clinical signs of disease, treatment procedures, and unusual morbidity and mortality events. These records must be retained for at least two years and will be made available for inspection by FDACS upon request.

- · Implement the requirements of Chapter X Shellfish Culture, Chapter XIV Aquatic Organism Health Management, Chapter XVIII Aquaculture Chemical and Drug Handling, and Chapter XIX Aquatic Animal Welfare.

## G. RECORD KEEPING

Farm Records identified in this chapter must be updated, maintained and made available to FDACS personnel during compliance inspections or upon request by FDACS.  Farmers may keep and analyze additional records related to feeding, chemical use, water quality, serious weather conditions, fish culture operations, and inventory to facilitate improvements in the efficiency of farm input use. Such records must be reviewed by the farmer periodically to determine if they are useful and to provide insight into opportunities to improve farm operations.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Maintain the records required by the Aquaculture Best Management Practices Manual for a minimum of two years in a form readily and immediately available to FDACS personnel during compliance visits or to FDACS upon request.
- · The processes and procedures utilized to collect and analyze environmental data (physical, chemical or biological) must be documented in a Quality Assurance Project Plan.  Farm operators must submit such plans to FDACS during the aquaculture certification process.

## VIII. PENAEID SHRIMP CULTURE

Penaeid shrimp aquaculture technology is in a process of continual evolution, evaluation and improvement. These BMPs are intended to help penaeid shrimp producers set high standards and maintain environmental compatibility.

## A. CONTAINMENT

Systems must be designed to accommodate rainfall events and to prevent stormwater from causing the escape of cultured shrimp and discharge of production waters into waters of the State. Similarly, aquaculture production units and aquaculture systems must be designed to prevent native species and other unwanted species from entering the system and interacting with domesticated animals.

## XI. LIVE ROCK AND MARINE LIFE CULTURE

Live rock consists of geologically distinct substrate placed on the ocean bottom to attract colonizing plant and invertebrate species.  The rock is collected after several years of culture and sold into the marine aquaria trade.  Aquaculture live rock substrate often recruits sea fans, hard or stony corals, fire coral and other attached marine life restricted species.  These attached marine life species may be possessed, cultured, harvested and sold by certified aquaculturists so long as the live rock and/or marine life product is identified as an aquaculture product pursuant to Chapter 597, F.S.  The use of sovereignty submerged lands for aquaculture requires that the operator obtain a sovereignty submerged land aquaculture lease.  Persons interested in conducting aquaculture activities on or above state lands should contact FDACS for assistance.

Elkhorn and staghorn corals are species listed under the Endangered Species Act and may not be possessed, harvested, cultured or sold. Federal agencies and FWC may list endangered or threatened species at any time. Live rock or marine life farmers should contact FDACS for current species regulations.

A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Programmatic General Permit (SAJ-99), Live Rock and Marine Bivalve Aquaculture in the State of Florida, authorizes farmers that hold an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration and comply with the Aquaculture Best Management Practices, Sovereignty Submerged Lands Lease Agreement, and Special Conditions described in the Programmatic General Permit to deposit materials and other works in the waters of the State of Florida.  Live rock farmers that cannot comply with the Programmatic General Permit must acquire an Individual Permit and should contact FDACS for information or assistance.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issues permits for aquacultured live rock in federal waters off the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic coasts of Florida through U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Programmatic General Permit (SAJ-71, Live Rock Aquaculture - Off the Coasts of Florida). Visit Fisheries.NOAA.gov/southeast/resources-fishing/permits-applications-and-formssoutheast#aquaculture-applications to access permit applications.

- · Use of Florida wild live rock in the culture of aquaculture live rock is prohibited.
- · An FWC license is required to harvest, possess, sell, or transport wild marine life.

Best Management Practices for Live Rock Leases Located in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary:

- · Live rock planted on an aquaculture lease in any area of the state, besides those located in Monroe County, shall not be moved to a live rock lease located within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
- · The lease area shall be marked with temporary surface buoys during rock deposition and harvest.
- · The leaseholder shall adhere to the following detailed dive gear decontamination requirements to avoid inadvertently spreading pathogens associated with the stony coral tissue loss disease:
- · Tools, collection bags, sampling gear, transect tapes, clipboards, underwater slates, weight belts and other equipment that comes in contact with the bottom should be decontaminated using diluted chlorine bleach. Bleach is extremely corrosive to metals and should not be used to decontaminate regulators or neoprene wet suits as it can compromise the integrity of polymers such as neoprene and silicone rubber components in regulators. Bleach should never be mixed with ammonia-based solutions. Bleach rapidly degrades and must be used immediately after mixing; it should be changed daily.
- · After each dive, soak non-sensitive equipment and tools for 10 minutes in a 1% bleach solution (1/2 c. bleach/2 gal. water prepared in a 5-gallon bucket with a lid).
- · Rinse with fresh water, air dry. Wetsuits, Buoyancy Compensation Devices (BCDs), masks and fins should be decontaminated using quaternary ammonium disinfectants such as Virkon S1, RelyOn1 and Lysol1 All Purpose

Cleaner. These are broad spectrum disinfectants and are effective for treating bacteria, viruses, fungi, larval mollusks and other microorganisms.

- · After each dive, soak dive gear for 10 minutes in one of the following: 0.5% RelyOn (four 5 g. tablets/1 gal. water), 1% Virkon S (1.3 oz./2 gal. water), 6.6% Lysol (1 qt./1 gal. water), or an equal concentration of another quaternary ammonium disinfectant.
- · Remove from disinfecting solution, soak in fresh water for 10 minutes, and allow to air dry.
- · Particular attention needs to focus on decontaminating wetsuits and the internal bladders of BCs because of their ability to trap water that can house transmissible pathogens. Pour approximately ½ liter solution into the mouthpiece of the BC's exhaust hose while depressing the exhaust button, inflate the BC, and gently rotate the BCD in all directions to ensure the solution has reached all of the internal parts. Allow the BCD to sit for 10 minutes, and then immediately dump the solution into a container for proper disposal on land Flush the BCD two times with fresh water. Regulators, computers, gauges, underwater cameras and other sensitive scientific equipment should be decontaminated using fresh water with antibacterial dish soap or an isopropyl alcohol wipe and let dry.
- · Prepare a solution of warm water and antibacterial dish soap or OdoBan1 (5 oz./gal.). After each dive, soak regulators and other sensitive equipment for 20 minutes, rinse in fresh water and allow to dry.
- · Additionally/alternatively, equipment can be wiped down with isopropyl alcohol. Be sure to wipe any small areas where water might accumulate.

See Appendix for complete list of all required BMPs for live rock and marine life.

## XII. AQUATIC PLANT CULTURE

The aquatic plant industry in Florida produces high quality plants for a wide variety of markets and uses: aquariums, water gardening, wetland mitigation and restoration, biofuels and pharmaceutical applications.

## A. FERTILIZER APPLICATION

## Best Management Practices:

- · Apply fertilizer to substrate during preparation of the grow-out tank while it is dry.   Use a slow-release fertilizer and evenly incorporate it into the soil.
- · If it is necessary to apply fertilizer into a grow-out tank or pond which is inundated, use fertilizer spikes which can be pushed into the substrate near the target plant.  Once the 'food spike' is below the surface, it should be covered with soil to prevent the loss of nutrients to the water column.
- · Minimize  the  need  for  additional  fertilizer  by  maintaining  a  static  water  level  in  the production tanks or ponds.

## B. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Aquatic plant nurseries are regulated by two divisions within FDACS: the Division of Aquaculture and the Division of Plant Industry (DPI).  The Division of Aquaculture ensures compliance with all aspects of this BMP manual.  DPI ensures compliance with import/export, species, pest, disease, wild-collection, and environmental restoration regulations.

A primary role of DPI, with respect to the aquatic plant industry, is to oversee the possession of nonnative species.  The purpose of this oversight is to prevent the introduction and spread of nuisance plants or disease which may displace native species and negatively impact Florida's ecosystems.  There are two classes of prohibited aquatic plants:

Class I be  possessed,  collected,  transported,  cultivated  or

These  plants  may not imported.

Class II These plants may be cultured in an aquatic plant nursery for sale out of state, and only with approval of DPI.

A listing of all Class I and Class II prohibited aquatic plants is found in Prohibited Aquatic Plants, Rule 5B-64.011, F.A.C., and is referenced in the appendix.

## Best Management Practices:

- · It  is  prohibited to possess and culture Class I aquatic plants.  If you discover a Class I species in a shipment you receive, or on your facility, contact FDACS, Division of Plant Industry at once.
- · Do not import, cultivate or export Class II Prohibited Species without prior authorization from  FDACS, Division of Plant  Industry.    If  you  intend  to  handle  Class  II  Prohibited Species, you must provide the necessary measures to ensure that these plants do not escape your  facility.    These  methods  are  outlined  in  the  Containment  chapter  of  this  manual. While the aforementioned chapter primarily addresses biosecurity for nonnative animals, the  containment  strategies  are  also  applicable  to  the  containment  of  nonnative  aquatic plants and algae.
- · Certified aquaculturists must apply to and receive from FDACS written authorization prior to culturing transgenic aquatic species. Certified aquaculturists must supply information to FDACS describing:
- 1) facility design
- 2) production system design
- 3) containment measures
- 4) Federal Agency review
- 5) biological information
- 6) genetic construct and development process
- 7) genetic construct introduction and organism information
- 8) gene construct expression information
- 9) related human health information
- 10) survival and persistence studies
- · Authorization to culture transgenic aquatic species will only be considered:
- 1) after all requested information is provided;
- 2) after the Department has reviewed all other information that has been submitted by the public; and
- 3) if upon review of all the foregoing it can be determined that authorization will not pose a threat to the environment, public health, safety, and welfare.
- · Certified aquaculturists must adhere to all stipulations required in the FDACS written letter of authorization.

## See Appendix for complete list of all required BMPs for aquatic plants.

## XIII. FLORIDA LARGEMOUTH BASS CULTURE

Protecting the genetic integrity of the Florida largemouth bass is critical to ensure the longterm viability of this important and iconic Florida gamefish. The following BMPs are designed to provide guidance related to genetic authentication, production, and transportation of live Florida largemouth bass.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Fish of the genus Micropterus (black bass), except the Florida largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides floridanus , may be cultured for stocking purposes only. Buying, selling, bartering, trading or exchanging of these species for human consumption is prohibited.
- · Any facility that seeks authorization to culture Florida largemouth bass must submit stock acquisition documentation and genetic testing records for approval by the Division prior to beginning any production of this species.
- · Florida largemouth bass fingerlings must be purchased from a facility utilizing genetically authenticated Florida largemouth bass broodstock. Fingerlings from genetically authenticated broodstock do not require further genetic testing prior to transportation or sale. Purchase records must be maintained for three years beyond the life of the fish.
- · Wild collection of broodfish requires a separate FWC permit. Please contact your local FWC Regional Office and ask for the Regional Fisheries Administrator to inquire about a broodfish collection permit application.
- · A copy of the genetic authentication documentation must accompany all bills of sale, bills of lading or other such manifest and must include the Aquaculture Certificate of Registration Number.
- · Florida largemouth bass imported from out-of-state sources for aquaculture purposes must be accompanied by acquisition documentation and genetic testing results from an FWC-approved laboratory. Acquisition documentation and genetic testing results must be provided to and approved by FDACS, Division of Aquaculture via email at Aquaculture\_Health@FDACS.gov prior to shipment.

## A. GENETIC AUTHENTICATION

## Best Management Practices:

- · Genetic testing procedures must be authorized by FWC before a specific laboratory can be approved to genetically authenticate Florida largemouth bass. Contact the Division for more information about genetic authentication testing procedures and for a list of approved laboratories. Refer to Section 1A, Genetic Authentication Testing Verification Requirements of the Standards for Genetic Authentication for Florida Largemouth Bass document incorporated into Rule 68A-23.009, F.A.C.
- · Genetic testing must be conducted by an FWC-approved laboratory.
- · Genetic testing results must be submitted to FDACS, Division of Aquaculture via email at Aquaculture\_Health@FDACS.gov by an FWC-approved laboratory upon completion of genetic testing. Testing results must correlate to individual tag numbers affixed to each broodfish. Testing results must be maintained and be available for inspection for three years beyond the life of the fish.
- · Genetic tests may be conducted using a microsatellite DNA genetic technique developed to differentiate northern largemouth bass ( M. s. salmoides ) from Florida largemouth bass, the single nucleotide polymorphism assay developed by The Center for Aquaculture Technologies titled the Florida Bass Certification Test in their catalogue of services, or a laboratory must describe a proposed procedure which, at a minimum, uses PCR-based typing of no fewer than six subspecies-specific nuclear DNA markers. Other methods evaluated and approved by FWC may be utilized for genetic authentication.

## B. HATCHERY MANAGEMENT

In order to confirm that all fish being cultured are Florida largemouth bass, each hatchery holding broodstock and producing Florida largemouth bass offspring must meet the following requirements.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Each broodfish must be permanently tagged with a commercially available tag that allows for individual recognition and tracking and has a high retention rate. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are recommended.  Each tag must have a unique number for individual identification; that is, a tag number may not be used on more than one broodfish. Each tag must remain in place throughout the time a fish is used as broodstock (or is in the same tank or pond as current broodstock).

- · A genetic sample must be taken from each potential broodfish that is collected. Samples must be submitted to an FWC-approved genetic laboratory for authentication. All potential broodfish awaiting genetic authentication testing results must be held in secure systems that are accessible to sort and cull fish until genetic testing is completed and results are available. Immediately after results are obtained, any northern or hybrid largemouth bass must be promptly euthanized or culled for other legal uses.
- · Once a broodfish has been genetically authenticated, that fish does not have to be reauthenticated unless it can no longer be identified by tag and tagging records.  Any fish that does not have a tag must be separated from tagged fish, and subsequently re-tagged and genetically authenticated prior to being utilized for any further production or held with other genetically authenticated Florida largemouth bass.
- · Each year prior to spawning, it is recommended that each broodfish have its tag inspected to confirm it is authenticated Florida largemouth bass stock. Tag inspection records must be maintained for a minimum of three years and made available for inspection by the Division upon request.
- · The same tagging and genetic evaluation procedures must be completed for any domesticated offspring that are selected for use as broodstock. Any northern largemouth bass, or intergrades (i.e., hybrids) confirmed by genetic testing must be promptly euthanized or culled for other legal uses.
- · FDACS may take a random sample at any facility producing Florida largemouth bass to confirm genetic authentication standards. If any sample is determined not to be Florida largemouth bass, that production system must be segregated until a secondary genetic analysis of submitted samples can be completed. If the secondary analysis determines samples not to be Florida largemouth bass, the entire production system the sample was taken from must be euthanized or culled for other legal uses.

## XIV. AQUATIC ORGANISM HEALTH MANAGEMENT

Good aquatic organism health practices are necessary for the success of any aquaculture production facility.  Disease prevention is based on good animal husbandry practices, including the reduction of animal stress, minimization of pathogens in the culture environment, and quarantine of unhealthy animals.  FDACS strongly encourages aquaculturists to develop a written aquatic animal health management plan for their facility.  Resources for training, education, and disease diagnostic assistance are available from several sources within the State. See the Appendix for contact information.  The following BMPs, when used in consultation with an aquatic animal health professional or the State Veterinarian Office, are intended to provide the basic components of an aquatic animal health management plan.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Written authorization, import permit, or a certificate of health may be required from the State Veterinarian prior to interstate importation of aquatic species from outside Florida. For international importation into the U.S. please contact USDA and USFWS for more information regarding any health requirements they may impose.
- · All health records for aquatic organisms imported from outside of Florida must be retained for at least two years by certified aquaculturists.  These records shall include:
- · Aquaculture Certificate of Registration Number
- · Name and Address of consignor
- · Name and Address of consignee
- · Date of Shipment
- · Date of entry/receipt
- · Species
- · Total number of aquatic animals by species
- · Any pertinent recent diagnostic test results performed to the group of aquatic organisms
- · Contact your aquatic animal health professional or the State Veterinarian's Office in the event of any unusual or abnormal occurrences of disease or pests affecting your aquatic species.
- · Aquatic organisms affected by an abnormal occurrence of disease or an undetermined pathogen should be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for diagnostics and treatment recommendations. Seek assistance from an Aquatic Animal Health Specialist.

- · Certified aquaculturists and/or their aquatic animal health professional must notify FDACS Division of Aquaculture, at (850) 617-7600 or Aquaculture\_Health@FDACS.gov, and FDACS Division of Animal Industry, State Veterinarian's Office, at (850) 410-0900 or after hours at (800) 342-5869, or by email at RAD@FDACS.gov, in the event of any suspected, undetermined or confirmed test results, prior to shipment or during routine surveillance, of any reportable pathogen as determined by the WOAH, USDA APHIS VS, or the State Veterinarian. Reporting must be done within 24 hours of receipt of results or suspicion of disease. See APHIS.USDA.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth for more information .
- · Educate yourself as much as possible regarding aquatic animal health management and the husbandry requirements of the species that you are raising.  Sources of information include health management classes and a Fish Health Video series produced by the University of Florida, Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory and distributed by the Florida Tropical Fish Farms Association, among others.
- · Follow accepted husbandry practices to maintain a favorable growing environment, such as the following:
- · Avoid over crowding
- · Maintain optimal nutritional programs
- · Promptly remove uneaten or undigested food
- · Promptly remove dead animals
- · Maintain appropriate water quality parameters
- · Minimize stress such as inappropriate, unnecessary handling, and temperature extremes
- · Establish a health surveillance and disease diagnosis control program.
- · Institute effective biosecurity measures consistent with BMPs.
- · Educate personnel on the normal behavioral patterns of aquatic species, to easily distinguish abnormal behavior patterns as a means for early recognition of stress or disease.
- · Aquatic organisms affected by an abnormal occurrence of disease or an undetermined pathogen should be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for diagnostics and treatment recommendations.
- · Use medications and remedial agents consistent with the label instructions or as directed by a licensed veterinarian.

- · When necessary, establish adequate quarantine and/or isolation practices and procedures.
- · Institute a daily program of observing aquatic organism behavior and feeding activity to detect disease problems.
- · Periodically test water quality for dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, ammonia and nitrite, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity and total hardness.  Know the physiological limits of your species.  Establish control and response actions when deviating from normal values.  Document all corrective actions.
- · Feed a high-quality diet proper for the species you are raising.
- · Store feeds and medications under cool, dry conditions to prevent degradation.
- · Sanitize nets and aquatic organism handling equipment to prevent the spread of disease.
- · Sanitize tanks or ponds following disease outbreaks or before stocking with new populations.

## SEE INDIVIDUAL SPECIES SECTIONS FOR SPECIFIC HEALTH BMPS OR CONTACT FDACS

## XV. DISPOSAL OF DEAD ANIMALS

Dead animals and those culled from production must be disposed of in a timely and sanitary manner following state and federal guidelines.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Render, compost, bury greater than 2 feet or burn dead animals in a timely and sanitary manner or dispose of in via a permitted waste collection or disposal site. Animals must be disposed of in a manner than reduces wildlife interactions with mortalities.
- · Contact FDACS for additional information.

## XVI. PREVENTING WILDLIFE DEPREDATION

Wild animals contribute to our enjoyment of nature and outdoor recreation, but they can also damage property, agriculture, natural resources and threaten human health and safety.  Numerous species of wildlife prey on aquaculture species or serve as vectors for disease, both of which may cause substantial losses.  Protecting aquaculture species may require using several different methods of deterrence or control.  Operators must be aware of and abide by all State and Federal laws regarding appropriate control methods for predatory species.  The BMPs listed below should be followed to deter or control animal pests successfully and legally.

For an animal depredation control permit, contact USDA Wildlife Services, 2820 E. University Ave., Gainesville, Florida at (352) 377-5556 or 1408 24th Street S.E., Ruskin, Florida at (813) 671-5230, Ext. 105. Questions may also be directed to the Division at (850) 617-7600.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Follow all state and federal laws and regulations that apply to the nuisance species as most birds, mammals, and reptiles are protected by law and require a State or Federal permit to trap or shoot.
- · Adhere to the following publications which are incorporated by reference into Rule 5L3.004, F.A.C.

USDA APHIS Wildlife Services, Prevention and Control of Wildlife Damage, Bird Dispersal Techniques (1994). and USDA APHIS Wildlife Services, Prevention and Control of Wildlife Damage,

Bird Damage at Aquaculture Facilities (1994).

- · Follow all provisions of federal or state depredation permits.
- · Use of noise producing devices, including propane cannons and pyrotechnics are suitable best management practices for the control of birds but should be limited to the minimal amount needed for adequate control and shall only be used from sunrise to sunset.
- · Adhere to the provisions of Agricultural and Fish Hatchery Use of Firecrackers, Rule Chapter 5A-3, F.A.C., to obtain proper authorization prior to use of pyrotechnic devices as prescribed in Sale of Fireworks, Chapter 791, F.S.
- · Propane cannons and pyrotechnic devices should be strategically located and operated to minimize off site impact.  Use of simple blast shields to reduce the noise projected behind the cannon when located near residential developments.

## XVII. SHIPMENT, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE

During shipment and transportation, care must be taken so that potential for escape of aquacultural products is minimized, and state laws are met in the identification of products. The following BMPs apply to all certified aquaculturists.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Aquaculture products must be identified with an Aquaculture Certificate of Registration number, while possessed, transported or sold from harvest to point of sale.
- · Proof of a valid Aquaculture Certificate of Registration must be possessed and available for inspection (copy or original of the Aquaculture Certificate of Registration or card) while harvesting, transporting and selling aquaculture products.
- · The receipt, bills of sale, bills of lading, or other such manifest must show the certificate number and where the product originated.  If the product is sold to a Florida grow-out facility, the Aquaculture Certificate of Registration number of the buyer must also be included.  Sale records must contain at least the following information:
- · Date of Sale
- · Name and address of Seller
- · Seller's Aquaculture Certificate of Registration number
- · Name and address of the Purchaser
- · Purchaser's Aquaculture Certificate of Registration number (if a Florida Certified Aquaculture Facility)
- · Quantity and species identification of aquaculture products sold
- · Aquaculture products must be transported in containers that separate aquaculture products pursuant to Identification of Aquaculture Products, Section 597.004(4), F.S., from wild stocks, and such containers must be identified by tags or labels which are securely attached and clearly displayed.  Tags/labels must contain information describing the source location, species identification, quantity and date of harvest.
- · Facilities must maintain records of all live purchases and/or all live sales of sturgeon, marine shrimp, marine bivalves, aquatic turtles and live rock/marine life. These records must include the date of shipment, name, address, and Aquaculture Certification of Registration number(s) of the supplier and the recipient if purchased or sold in Florida. Records must be retained by the hatchery or farm and available for inspection for at least two years. Invoices or bills of lading containing the above information is sufficient to meet this BMP requirement.

- · Facilities must maintain records of all live purchases and/or all live sales of restricted species.  These records must include the date of shipment, name, address, and Aquaculture Certificate of Registration number(s) of the supplier and the recipient if purchased or sold in Florida and a copy of the Restricted Species Authorization or Conditional Species Authorization for the buyer. Records must be retained by the hatchery or farm and available for inspection for at least two years.
- · Pursuant to Rule 68A-25.002(6)(c), F.A.C., the sale of turtles or turtle eggs taken from the wild is prohibited.
- · Aquatic  turtle  broodstock  acquisition  documentation  must  be  provided  to  FDACS  for approval prior to certification and as broodstock are added to the facility.
- · Aquaculture Certificate of Registration holders or employees of a certificate holder must notify FDACS at least 24 hours in advance of any transport of aquaculture turtles across or on state waters.
- · Aquaculture turtles may not be transported in vehicles or vessels containing fishing gear including, but not limited to, trawls, seines and entangling nets, traps and hook and line.
- · Aquaculture turtles may not be harvested using hook and line.
- · The importation and interstate movement of live aquatic snails is regulated by United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Plant Protection Quarantine (USDA APHIS PPQ).  APHIS PPQ Form 526 (Plant Pest Permit) is required for the importation or interstate movement of any terrestrial or aquatic snails listed as plant pests.
- · Marine snails and terrestrial or aquatic snails that are not plant pests are not regulated by USDA APHIS PPQ and do not require a permit.  Contact USDA APHIS PPQ for more information on snails recognized as plant pests and permitting requirements.  Refer to the Appendix for contact information.  The USFWS may require an import permit for invertebrate species.
- · The processing or preparation of aquaculture products for human consumption requires a hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) plan and may require a license from FDACS-Division of Food Safety.  See the Appendix for contact information.

## XVIII. AQUACULTURE CHEMICAL AND DRUG HANDLING

Florida's water resources are particularly susceptible to contamination because of the State's unique geology and hydrology.  Groundwater supply often lies at or near the surface, and users of agrichemicals and drugs need to consider the soil's susceptibility to leaching, distance to the water table, slope of the land, and distance to surface water which could provide a direct pathway to ground water.  Clay or muck soils are capable of binding certain pesticides with repeated applications.  Proper handling, application and disposal practice through the use of BMPs can prevent the contamination of soil, surface waters, and ground water.

All persons who apply restricted use pesticides to any outdoor area in Florida not associated with buildings or public health pest control must have a pesticide applicator license issued by the FDACS, Division of Agricultural Environmental Services, Bureau of Licensing and Enforcement.  For pesticide applicator certification and licensing call (850) 617-7870.

## A. CHEMICAL USAGE AND HANDLING

## Best Management Practices:

- · Follow all product label directions for use, storage and disposal.
- · Use in accordance with all applicable Federal and State guidelines and laws.
- · Maintain a log of chemical usage at the facility.  Logs and records must be available for inspection by FDACS.

## B. SPILL MANAGEMENT

## Best Management Practices:

- · Immediately contain and dispose of spilled or leaking materials by utilizing barriers and/or absorbent material such as activated charcoal, cat litter, dry sand, or soil in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations and/or State and Federal laws.
- · No spills or leaks shall be left unattended.

For additional information about chemical usage, copies of additional chemical data please contact FDACS, at (850) 617-7600.

## C. DRUG USAGE AND HANDLING

There is a limited number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and therapeutants available to treat aquatic animals. For current information, contact a licensed veterinarian or visit the Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership website at: http://www.fws.gov/program/aquatic-animal-health/aquatic-animal-drug-approval-partnership.

## Best Management Practices:

- · All drugs, therapeutic substances, and antibiotics must be used, applied, stored, or disposed only as directed by an FDA approved product label or as prescribed by a Florida licensed veterinarian.
- · Drugs may not be used or prescribed for extra-label use when the drug label prohibits extra-label use.
- · Maintain a log of drug usage at the facility.

## XIX. AQUATIC ANIMAL WELFARE

Successful aquatic animal husbandry demands that animals be held in optimal environments and fed a high-quality diet. Aquatic animals intended for human consumption shall be quickly prepared for rapid processing. Euthanasia, slaughter, or depopulation shall be performed quickly and in a manner to limit the stress to the animal. Aquatic animals reared for stocking in public waters shall be transported under optimal environmental conditions.

## Best Management Practices:

- · Pursuant to Humane Euthanasia of Livestock, Rule Chapter 5C-25, F.A.C., only humane methods may be used for the euthanasia of aquaculture species.

## 597.003 Powers and duties of Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

- (1) The department is the lead agency in regulating and encouraging the development of aquaculture in this state and has and shall exercise the following functions, powers, and duties with regard to aquaculture:
- (a) Issue or deny aquaculture certificates that identify aquaculture producers and aquaculture products, and collect all related fees. The department may revoke an aquaculture certificate of registration issued pursuant to s. 597.004 upon a finding that aquaculture is not the primary purpose of the certified entity's operation.
- (b) Coordinate the development, annual revision, and implementation of a state aquaculture plan. The plan must include prioritized recommendations for research and development as

suggested by the Aquaculture Review Council and public and private institutional research, extension, and service programs.

- (c) Develop memoranda of agreement, as needed, with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Florida Sea Grant Program, and other groups as provided in the state aquaculture plan.
- (d) Provide staff for the Aquaculture Review Council.
- (e) Forward the annually revised state aquaculture plan to the commissioner and to the chairs of the House Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Services and the Senate Committee on Agriculture 1 month prior to submission of the department's legislative budget request to the Governor.
- (f) Upon the appropriation of funds by the Legislature, submit the list of research and development projects proposed to be funded through the department as identified in the state aquaculture plan, to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. These projects must be contracted for by the Division of Aquaculture and must require public-private partnerships, when appropriate. The contracts must require a percentage of the profit generated by the project to be deposited into the General Inspection Trust Fund solely for funding aquaculture projects recommended by the Aquaculture Review Council.
- (g) Provide developmental assistance to the various sectors of the aquaculture industry as determined in the state aquaculture plan.
- (h) Assist persons seeking to engage in aquaculture when applying for the necessary permits and serve as ombudsman to resolve complaints or otherwise resolve problems arising between aquaculture producers and regulatory agencies.
- (i) Develop and propose to the Legislature legislation necessary to implement the state aquaculture plan or to otherwise encourage the development of aquaculture in this state.
- (j) Issue or deny any license or permit authorized or delegated to the department by the Legislature or through memorandum of understanding with other state or federal agencies that furthers the intent of the Legislature to place the regulation of aquaculture in the department.
- (k) Make available state lands and the water column for the purpose of producing aquaculture products when the aquaculture activity is compatible with state resource management goals, environmental protection, and proprietary interest and when such state lands and waters are determined to be suitable for aquaculture development by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund pursuant to s. 253.68; provide training as necessary to lessees; and be responsible for all saltwater aquaculture activities located on sovereignty

submerged land or in the water column above such land and adjacent facilities directly related to the aquaculture activity.

- 1. The department shall act in cooperation with other state and local agencies and programs to identify and designate sovereignty lands and waters that would be suitable for aquaculture development.
- 2. The department shall identify and evaluate specific tracts of sovereignty submerged lands and water columns in various areas of the state to determine where such lands and waters are suitable for leasing for aquaculture purposes. This subparagraph or subparagraph 1. does not preclude the applicant from applying for sites identified by the applicant.
- 3. The department shall provide assistance in developing technologies applicable to aquaculture activities, evaluate practicable production alternatives, and provide agreements to develop innovative culture practices.
- (l) Act as a clearinghouse for aquaculture applications, and act as a liaison between the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Division of State Lands, the Department of Environmental Protection district offices, other divisions within the Department of Environmental Protection, and the water management districts. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is responsible for regulating marine aquaculture producers, except as specifically provided herein.

## 597.010 Shellfish regulation; leases.

- (1) LEASE, APPLICATION FORM. When any qualified person desires to lease a part of the bottom, water column, or bed of any of the water of this state for the purpose of growing oysters or clams, as provided for in this section, he or she shall present to the department a written application pursuant to s. 253.69.
- (2) LANDS TO BE LEASED. The lands leased shall be as compact as possible, taking into consideration the shape of the body of water and the condition of the bottom as to hardness, or soft mud or sand, or other conditions that would render the bottoms desirable or undesirable for the purpose of oyster or clam cultivation.
- (3) SURVEYS, PLATS, AND MAPS OF REEFS. The department shall accept, adopt, and use official reports, surveys, and maps of oyster, clam, or other shellfish grounds made under the direction of any authority of the United States as prima facie evidence of the natural oyster and clam reefs and beds, for the purpose and intent of this chapter. The department may also make surveys of any natural oyster or clam reefs or beds when it deems such surveys necessary and where such surveys are made pursuant to an application for a lease, the cost thereof may be charged to the applicant as a part of the cost of his or her application.
- (4) EXECUTION OF LEASES; LESSEE TO STAKE OFF BOUNDARIES; PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS. When a survey of the lands to be leased has been completed pursuant to s. 253.69 and filed with the department, and the cost thereof paid by the applicant, the department may execute in duplicate a lease of the water bottoms to the applicant. One duplicate, with a plat or map of the water bottoms so leased, shall be delivered to the applicant, and the other, with a plat or map of the bottom so leased, shall be retained by the department and registered in a lease book which shall be kept exclusively for that purpose by the department; thereafter the lessees shall enjoy the exclusive use of the lands and all oysters and clams, shell, and cultch grown or placed thereon shall be the exclusive property of such lessee as long as he or she shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and chapter 253. The department shall require the lessee to stake off and mark the water bottoms leased, by such ranges, monuments, stakes, buoys, etc., so placed and made as not to interfere with the

navigation, as it may deem necessary to locate the same to the end that the location and limits of the lands embraced in such lease be easily and accurately found and fixed, and such lessee shall keep the same in good condition during the open and closed oyster or clam season. All leases shall be marked according to the standards set forth in s. 253.72. The department may stipulate in each individual lease contract the types, shape, depth, size, and height of marker or corner posts. Failure on the part of the lessee to comply with the orders of the department to this effect within the time fixed by it, and to keep the markers, etc., in good condition during the open and closed oyster or clam season, shall subject such lessee to a fine not exceeding $100 for each and every such offense.

- (5) LEASES IN PERPETUITY; RENT.
- (a) All leases issued previously under the provisions of s. 379.2525 shall be enforced under the authority of this chapter, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, and shall continue in perpetuity under such restrictions as stated in the lease agreement. The annual rental fee charged for all leases shall consist of the minimum rate of $15 per acre, or any fraction of an acre, per year and shall be adjusted on January 1, 1995, and every 5 years thereafter, based on the 5-year average change in the Consumer Price Index. Rent shall be paid in advance of January 1 of each year or in the case of a new lease at the time of signing, regardless of who holds the lease.
- (b) All fees collected under this subsection and subsection (6) shall be deposited in the General Inspection Trust Fund and shall be used for shellfish aquaculture activities.
- (6) FORFEITURE FOR NONPAYMENT. All leases shall stipulate that failure to timely pay the rent on or before January 1 of each year shall cause the department, at its discretion, to terminate and cancel the lease after the department has given the lessee 30 days' written notice of the nonpayment. If after receiving the notice the lessee chooses to keep the lease, the lessee shall pay the rental fee plus a $50 late fee within the 30-day period. After the 30-day notice has expired, the department may take possession of the lease and all improvements, assets, clams, and oysters thereon.
- (7) SURCHARGE FOR IMPROVEMENT OR REHABILITATION. A surcharge of $10 per acre, or any fraction of an acre, per annum shall be levied upon each lease, other than a perpetual lease granted pursuant to former chapter 370 prior to 1985, and deposited into the General Inspection Trust Fund. The purpose of the surcharge is to provide a mechanism to have financial resources immediately available for improvement of lease areas and for cleanup and rehabilitation of abandoned or vacated lease sites. The department is authorized to adopt rules necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.

- (a) Moneys in the fund that are not needed currently for cleanup and rehabilitation of abandoned or vacated lease sites shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer to the credit of the fund and may be invested in such manner as is provided for by statute. Interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund.
- (b) Funds within the General Inspection Trust Fund from receipts from the surcharge established in this section shall be disbursed for the following purposes and no others:
- 1. Administrative expenses, personnel expenses, and equipment costs of the department related to the improvement of lease areas, the cleanup and rehabilitation of abandoned or vacated aquaculture lease sites, and the enforcement of provisions of this section.

- 3. All costs and damages which are the proximate results of lease abandonment or vacation.
- 4. Reward payments made pursuant to s. 597.0045.

The department shall recover to the use of the fund from the person or persons abandoning or vacating the lease, jointly and severally, all sums owed or expended from the fund.

- (8) CULTIVATION REQUIREMENTS.
- (a) Effective cultivation shall consist of the growing of the oysters or clams in a density suitable for commercial harvesting over the amount of bottom prescribed by law. This commercial density shall be accomplished by the planting of seed oysters, shell, and cultch of various descriptions. The department may stipulate in each individual lease contract the types, shape, depth, size, and height of cultch materials on lease bottoms according to the individual shape, depth, location, and type of bottom of the proposed lease. Each lessee leasing lands under the provisions of this section or s. 253.71 shall begin, within 1 year after the date of such lease, bona fide cultivation of the same, and shall, by the end of the second year after the commencement of such lease, have placed under cultivation at least one-half of the leased area and shall each year thereafter place in cultivation at least one-fourth of the leased area until the whole, suitable for bedding of oysters or clams, shall have been put in cultivation. The cultivation requirements for perpetuity leases granted pursuant to former chapter 370 prior to 1985 under previously existing law shall comply with the conditions stated in the lease agreement, and the lessee or grantee is authorized to plant the leased or granted submerged land in both oysters and clams.

- (b) These stipulations apply to all leases granted after the effective date of this section. All leases existing prior to the effective date of this section will operate under the law that was in effect when the leases were granted.
- (c) When evidence is gathered by the department and such evidence conclusively shows a lack of effective cultivation, the department may revoke leases and return the bottoms in question to the public domain.
- (d) The department has the authority to adopt rules pertaining to the water column over shellfish leases. All cultch materials in place 6 months after the formal adoption and publication of rules establishing standards for cultch materials on shellfish leases that do not comply with such rules may be declared a nuisance by the department. The department has the authority to direct the lessee to remove such cultch in violation of this section. The department may cancel a lease upon the refusal by the lessee violating such rules to remove unlawful cultch materials, and all improvements, cultch, marketable oysters, and shell shall become the property of the state. The department has the authority to retain, dispose of, or remove such materials in the best interest of the state.
- (9) LEASES TRANSFERABLE, ETC. The leases in chapter 253 and former chapter 370 shall be inheritable and transferable, in whole or in part, and shall also be subject to mortgage, pledge, or hypothecation and shall be subject to seizure and sale for debts as any other property, rights, and credits in this state, and this provision shall also apply to all buildings, betterments, and improvements thereon. Leases granted under this section cannot be transferred, by sale or barter, in whole or in part, without the written, express approval of the department, and such a transferee shall pay a $50 transfer fee before department approval may be given. Leases inherited or transferred will be valid only upon receipt of the transfer fee and approval by the department. The department shall keep proper indexes so that all original leases and all subsequent changes and transfers can be easily and accurately ascertained.
- (10) CANCELLATION OF LEASES TO NATURAL REEFS OR BEDS. Any person, within 6 months after the execution of any lease, may file a petition with the department for the purpose of determining whether a natural oyster or clam reef or bed having an area of not less than 100 square yards existed within the leased area on the date of the lease, with sufficient natural or maternal oysters or clams thereon (not including coon oysters) to have constituted a stratum sufficient to have been resorted to by the public generally for the purpose of gathering the same to sell for a livelihood. The petition shall be in writing addressed to the department, verified under oath, stating the location and approximate area of the natural reef or bed and the

claim or interest of the petitioner therein and requesting the cancellation of the lease to the natural reef or bed. A petition may not be considered unless it is accompanied by a deposit of $500 to defray the expense of the department's investigation of the matter. Upon receipt of such petition, the department shall cause an investigation to be made into the truth of the allegations of the petition, and, if found untrue, the $500 deposit shall be retained by the department to defray the expense of the investigation, but should the allegations of the petition be found true and the leased premises to contain a natural oyster or clam reef or bed, as described in this subsection, the $500 deposit shall be returned to the petitioner and the costs and expenses of the investigation taxed against the lessee and the lease canceled to the extent of the natural reef or bed and the same shall be marked with buoys and stakes and notices placed thereon showing the same to be a public reef or bed, the cost of the markers and notices to be taxed against the lessee.

- (11) WHEN NATURAL REEFS OR BEDS MAY BE INCLUDED IN LEASE.
- (a) When an application for a submerged land lease for cultivating shellfish is filed, and when a resource survey of such lands identifies natural oyster or clam reefs or beds, the department shall determine if such reefs and beds are to be included in the leased area. The department, if it deems it to be in the best interest of the state, may include such natural reefs or beds in a lease. In those cases where a natural area is included in a lease, the department shall fix a reasonable value on the same, to be paid by the applicant for lease of such submerged land. No natural reefs shall be included in any shellfish or aquaculture lease granted in Franklin County.
- (b) The department shall determine and settle all disputes as to boundaries between lessees. The department shall, in all cases, determine whether a particular submerged land area contains a natural reef or bed or whether it is suitable for raising oysters or clams.
- (12) FRANKLIN COUNTY LEASES. On and after the effective date of this section, the only leases available in Franklin County shall be those issued pursuant to ss. 253.67-253.75; former chapter 370 leases shall no longer be available.

knowingly removes, breaks off, destroys, or otherwise injures or alters any stakes, bounds, monuments, buoys, notices, or other designations of any natural oyster or clam reefs or beds or private bedding or propagating grounds, or who willfully injures, destroys, or removes any other protection around any oyster or clam reefs or beds, or who willfully moves any bedding ground stakes, buoys, marks, or designations placed by the department, commits a violation of this section.

- (b) Harvesting shellfish is prohibited within a distance of 25 feet outside lawfully marked lease boundaries or within setback and access corridors within specifically designated highdensity aquaculture lease areas and aquaculture use zones.
- (14) SHELLFISH DEVELOPMENT. The department, in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Department of Environmental Protection, shall protect all clam beds, oyster beds, shellfish grounds, and oyster reefs from damage or destruction resulting from improper cultivation, propagation, planting, or harvesting. To this end, the Department of Health is authorized and directed to cooperate with the department and to make available its laboratory testing facilities and apparatus.
- (15) SPECIAL ACTIVITY LICENSES. The department is authorized to issue special activity licenses, in accordance with s. 597.020, to permit the harvest or cultivation of oysters, clams, mussels, and crabs.
- (16) STAKING OFF WATER BOTTOMS OR BEDDING OYSTERS WITHOUT OBTAINING LEASE. Any person staking off the water bottoms of this state, or bedding oysters on the bottoms of the waters of this state, without previously leasing same as required by law commits a violation of this section, and shall acquire no rights by reason of such staking off. This provision does not apply to grants heretofore made under the provisions of any heretofore existing laws or to artificial beds made heretofore by a riparian owner or his or her grantees on the owner's riparian bottoms.

- (21) OYSTER AND CLAM SHELLS PROPERTY OF DEPARTMENT.
- (a) Except for oysters used directly in the half-shell trade, 50 percent of all shells from oysters and clams shucked commercially in the state shall be and remain the property of the department when such shells are needed and required for rehabilitation projects and planting operations, in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, when sufficient resources and facilities exist for handling and planting such shells, and when the collection and handling of such shells is practicable and useful, except that bona fide holders of leases and grants may retain 75 percent of such shells as they produce for aquacultural purposes. Storage, transportation, and planting of shells so retained by lessees and grantees shall be carried out under the conditions of the lease agreement or with the written approval of the department and shall be subject to such reasonable time limits as the department may fix.

- (c) If oyster or clam shells are owned by the department and it is not useful or feasible to use them in the rehabilitation projects, and if a leaseholder has not exercised his or her option to acquire them, the department may sell such shells for the highest price obtainable. Such shells may be used in any manner and for any purpose at the discretion of the purchaser.
- (d) Moneys derived from the sale of shell shall be deposited in the General Inspection Trust Fund for shellfish programs.
- (e) The department may publish notice, in a newspaper serving the county, of its intention to collect the oyster and clam shells and shall notify, by certified mail, each shucking establishment from which shells are to be collected. The notice shall contain the period of time the department intends to collect the shells in that county and the collection purpose.
- (22) REQUIREMENTS FOR OYSTER OR CLAM VESSELS.
- (a) All vessels used for the harvesting, gathering, or transporting of oysters or clams for commercial purposes shall be constructed and maintained to prevent contamination or deterioration of shellfish. To this end, all such vessels shall have false bottoms and bulkheads fore and aft to prevent onboard shellfish from coming in contact with any bilge water. Dogs or other animals are not allowed at any time on vessels used to harvest or transport shellfish. A violation of this subsection will, at a minimum, result in the revocation of the violator's license.
- (b) For the purpose of this subsection, 'harvesting, gathering, or transporting of oysters or clams for commercial purposes' means to harvest, gather, or transport oysters or clams with the intent to sell and shall apply to a quantity of two or more bags of oysters per vessel or more than one 5-gallon bucket of unshucked hard clams per person or more than two 5-gallon buckets of unshucked hard clams per vessel.

## Mollusk Farms BAP Standards, Guidelines

## BEST AQUACULTURE PRACTICES CERTIFICATION

The following Best Aquaculture Practices standards and guidelines apply to the culture of molluscan shellfish, including all species of bivalves, such as clams, cockles, geoducks, oysters, scallops, and mussels, but excluding grazing gastropods (whelks, abalone) for which the BAP Farm Standard applies instead. They also apply to other species, such as holothurian echinoderms, if they are reared in open waters and rely exclusively on natural productivity for their sustenance.

Culture methods can include direct sowing onto the seabed, or containerized or attached to structures on or above the seabed, both intertidally and subtidally. Shallow and deep water systems of over 5 meters depth may suspend mollusks from longlines, rafts or other  floating  structures.  However,  the  scope  of  this  standard  does  not  include  intensive  or  nursery  culture  systems  that  use raceways, ponds or tanks, on shore or floating, for which the BAP Farm Standard or the BAP Hatchery and Nursery Standard apply.

The BAP standards are achievable, science-based and continuously improved global performance standards for the aquaculture supply  chain  that  assure  healthful  foods  produced  through  environmentally  and  socially  responsible  means.  They  are  designed to assist  program  applicants  in  performing  self-assessments  of  the  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  food  safety  controls  of their facilities. BAP Standards lead to certification of compliance after verification of the applicant's facilities by BAP approved third-party certification bodies. For further information, please refer to the additional resources listed throughout this document.

BAP standards demand compliance with local regulations as the first step toward certification. However, not all regulations are equally rigorous. For this reason, BAP standards set out requirements for documentation and procedures that shall be in facility management plans, whether they are prescribed by local regulations or not. By so doing, they seek, where possible, to impose consistency in performance among facilities in different producing regions and to engage the industry as a whole in a process of continuous improvement.

In common with ISO usage, these standards use the words 'shall' to mean compliance is required and 'should' to mean compliance is recommended. Auditable points are 'shall' statements listed at the end of each section.

## The Certification Process

## 1. Program Management

Best Aquaculture Practices is a division of  the  Global  Seafood  Alliance  (GSA),  with  offices  headquartered  in  Portsmouth,  New Hampshire, USA. Best Aquaculture Practices manages multiple GSA standards including the BAP Mollusk Farm Standard on behalf of the GSA.

To obtain BAP certification, applicant farms shall be audited by an independent, BAP-approved certification body (CB). To apply for certification, please contact:

Best Aquaculture Practices 85 New Hampshire Avenue, Suite 200 Portsmouth, NH 03801 USA Tel: +1-603-317-5000 Email: bapcert@bapcertification.org BAP Website: www.bapcertification.org GSA Website: www.globalseafood.org

## 2. Self-Assessment

New applicant farms are expected to carry out a self-assessment against the Standard to ascertain their preparedness for a third-party CB audit.

## 3. Third-party CB Assessments

Once a self-assessment has been carried out by the farm and it is satisfied that all deficiencies identified have been rectified, they can proceed  to  Certification.  To  become  certified,  farms  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  this  Standard,  through  an independent third-party on-site assessment by a GSA approved CB. The chosen CB will formulate an agreement between the farm

## Mollusk Farms

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

and the CB detailing the requirements and commitments needed from the farm.

New farms must be in operation for at least 3 months from commencing production to ensure that they can demonstrate full compliance to the Standard during the assessment.

## 4. Assessment Frequency

Audits to the BAP Mollusk Farm Standard are conducted at a frequency of once per annum. However, additional audits, re-audits, short notice, or unannounced audits shall also be conducted at the discretion of GSA and Certification Bodies where facility compliance concerns arise.

## 5. Duration of Assessments

The duration of an assessment is dependent on factors such as size of the operation/farm and number of personnel. In most cases the actual on-site audit duration for an individual farm facility is one full day. CBs are required to inform GSA-BAP where a deviation in audit duration is foreseen. The assessment format includes systems review and physical inspection of the site and production process. Time allocation during the assessment shall be such to provide sufficient and proportionate time for each activity to be carried out in full and where appropriate, additional time may be given when the auditor is required to carry out further investigation.

## 6. Audit Process (Figure 1)

All requirements in the Standard shall be addressed. As with other BAP standards, the audit against the BAP Mollusk Farm Standard will consist of elements listed in Figure 1 in accordance with ISO19011.

At the closing meeting, the auditor shall present his/her findings and review all non-conformities that have been identified during the assessment but shall not make comment on the likely outcome of the assessment. A written summary of the non-conformities discussed at the closing meeting shall be agreed upon and signatures from the farm representative obtained. A copy of the non-conformity report must  be  left  with  the  farm  prior  to  the  auditor  departing  the  farm.  The  farm  shall  provide  the  CB,  in  accordance  with  GSA/BAP certification management rules, suitable and adequate objective evidence that corrective action has been implemented to rectify the non-conformity. This evidence shall also address root cause and future prevention. The evidence will be reviewed, and the CB will respond either confirming closure of the non-conformity or requesting further evidence. The farm must submit evidence to the CB in order to close out all non-conformities within 35 calendar days from the day following the end of the audit. Failure to close out nonconformities in the given timeframe will result in certification not being granted or continued, and facilities will be required to re-apply for a full assessment for certification.

## 8. Audit Reporting and the Certification Decision

The auditor will provide a full report of the assessment, including the details of any non-conformities issued. The auditor will submit the report to the CB. The report shall include brief statements of objective evidence of both conformity, and non-conformity.

The report shall follow the format specified by the GSA-BAP. The report shall be issued in accordance with the GSA-BAP Report Guidelines. Within the audit report there shall be a record of the duration of the assessment (expressed as hours) and any reason for the lengthening or shortening of the duration from that which is typical.

The audit report along with the corrective actions submitted by the farm will be evaluated by a Certification Committee of the CB, who will make the final certification decision post closure of all non-conformities. The timelines for audit, closure of non-conformities, technical review and certification decision are as specified in the GSA-BAP CB Requirements Document available on the GSA-BAP website. In order to achieve certification to the BAP Mollusk Farm Standard, the applicant farm must meet all of the requirements of the Standard.

BAP standards are developed by committees of technical experts following a process aligned to the FAO Technical Guidelines  on Aquaculture Certification.

## Standard Version History

2013 - Mussel Farm Standard

2016 - Mollusk Farm Standard 1.0

2020 - Mollusk Farm Standard 1.1

## Summary of Key Changes from Issue 1.0 to 1.1

The scope of the BAP Mollusk Farm Standard has been changed, removing 'fed' species of mollusks (such as whelks and abalone), which will now be covered in the new BAP Farm Standard.

The scope of the BAP Mollusk Farm Standard now also includes extensively farmed holothurian echinoderms (sea cucumbers).

The scope of the  BAP  Mollusk  Farm  Standard  does  not  include  intensive  land-based  or  floating  growout  or  nursery  systems  in raceways, ponds, or tanks, which are covered by the respective BAP Farm or BAP Hatchery and Nursery Standards.

Section 11 (Environment - Fishmeal, Fish Oil and Kelp Conservation) from Issue 1.0 has been removed in its entirety, and what was Section 12 (Food Safety - Control of Potential Food Safety Hazards) in Issue 1.0 is now Section 11 in Issue 1.1, and what was Section 13  (Traceability  -  Record-Keeping  Requirement)  in  Issue  1.0  is  now  Section  12  in  Issue  1.1.    Clauses  have  been  renumbered accordingly.

## 1. Community

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

- · water use permits or  leases

## Property Rights and Regulatory Compliance

Aquaculture sites shall comply with local and national laws and environmental regulations and provide current documentation that demonstrates legal rights for land and seabed use, water use, construction, operation, food safety compliance and waste disposal.

## Reasons for Standard

Regulations are needed to assure that cultivation sites provide pertinent information to governments and pay fees to support relevant  programs.  The  BAP  program  requires  compliance with applicable  business-related  laws  and  environmental, social and food safety regulations, including those concerning protection of sensitive habitats, effluents, operation of landfills and  predator  control,  because  it  recognizes  that  not  all governmental agencies have sufficient resources to effectively enforce laws.

Some mollusk cultivation sites and their support facilities may be sited in water bodies or on land to which cultivation site owners do not have sole legal rights. These areas may be used by coastal communities for fishing, recreation, tourism and other uses. Unauthorized installation of cultivation sites can interfere with the use of resources by local communities.

## Implementation

Regulations  regarding  the  operation  and  resource  use  of cultivation sites vary significantly from place to place. Among other requirements, such laws may call for:

- · business licenses
- · aquaculture licenses
- · land deeds, leases or concession agreements
- · land use taxes
- · construction permits
- · waste and sewage water discharge permits and licenses
- · predator control permits
- · protection of sensitive habitats
- · protection of the rights of native peoples
- · environmental impact assessments
- · vessel and dive operating licenses, permits and certifications.

BAP  auditors  cannot  know  all  laws  that  apply  to  mollusk cultivation  in  all  nations.  Participating  cultivation  sites  have the responsibility to obtain all necessary documentation for siting,  constructing  and  operating  their  facilities,  and  make these available to auditors.

Assistance  in  determining  these  necessary  permits  and licenses can be sought from governmental agencies responsible for agriculture, environmental protection, fisheries and aquaculture, water management and transportation, as well as local aquaculture associations. BAP auditors must also become familiar with the legal requirements within the areas they service.

The BAP program imposes repeated audits of participating facilities.  It  augments  existing  regulations  that  may  require aquaculture facilities to perform environmental impact assessments before beginning construction and comply with regulations during operation.

During  the  BAP  site  inspection,  the  representative  of  the cultivation site shall present all necessary documents to the auditor.  Cultivation  sites  must  be  in  compliance  with  the requirements stipulated by the documents. In cases  where governmental agencies have waived one or more permits,  or the need for compliance with existing permits, proof of these waivers shall be available.

## Standards

- 1.1: Current documents shall be available to prove legal land, seabed and/or water use, where applicable.
- 1.2: Current documents shall be available to prove all business and operating licenses have been acquired.
- 1.3  : Current documents shall be available to prove compliance with applicable environmental regulations for construction and operation.
- 1.4  : Where applicable, current documents shall be available to prove compliance with laws protecting the resources of indigenous peoples and/or independent agreements the applicant may have made with them.
- 1.5  : Where applicable, current documents shall be available to show compliance with the cultivation site's own regional industry codes of practice, if they exist.

## 2. Community

## Community Relations

Cultivation  sites  shall  strive  for  good  community  relations, conduct their businesses responsibly and be responsive to those affected by their operations.

## Reasons for Standard

Aquaculture  sites  are  often  located  in  rural  areas,  where some  individuals  may  rely  on  varied  natural  resources  to supplement  their  livelihoods.  Some  local  residents  benefit from employment or infrastructure improvements associated with  large-scale  aquaculture  development,  but  others  may face limited access to areas used for fishing or recreation as a result of an aquaculture facility. Thus, it is intended that the BAP program will provide the framework to alleviate these difficulties to the extent that is practicable.

## Implementation

Participants  in  the  BAP  program  shall  be  good  neighbors within  local  communities  and  cooperate  with  other  rightful users of land and water to minimize conflicts. Cultivation site  managers  are  encouraged  to  communicate  regularly with  local  leaders.  They  should  also  respond  helpfully  to public requests for information.

To the extent practical,  access  to  cultivation  sites  shall be limited only to authorized persons, and signs shall be posted to identify possible safety hazards. However, traditional uses of  natural resources shall be accommodated, to the extent practical, through cooperation with local interests to ensure the highest possible level of environmental stewardship.

During facility or farm site inspection, the auditor must verify compliance  with the good  neighbor  standards  through examination  of  maps  that  define  public  and  private  zones and concession areas; on-site inspection of fences and other barriers (e.g., marker buoys); and interviews with local people and cultivation  site  workers.  The  auditor  should  select  the individuals for interview, rather than being provided a group of  interviewees  by  cultivation  site  management.  Through such interviews, auditors shall determine the helpfulness of the participant's  responses.

## Standards

- 2.1  : The applicant shall demonstrate that the aquaculture facility does not prevent legal access to traditional fishing areas and other established public resources, except as permitted by law.
- 2.2  : The applicant shall clearly identify all land-based aquaculture facility boundaries and post signs that warn the public and staff of potential safety hazards, where appropriate.
- 2.3  : The applicant shall demonstrate interaction and communication with the local community in response to issues that arise.
- 2.4: The applicant shall demonstrate a process, including but not limited to written policies, to avoid or resolve conflicts - for example, through meetings, committees, correspondence, service projects or other activities. The applicant shall  record all conflicts, steps taken to resolve them and outcomes.
- 2.5  : Where applicable, the applicant must demonstrate dialogue with local indigenous peoples and written policies and procedures for conflict resolution with them under the laws governing their rights. The applicant shall record all conflicts, steps taken to resolve them and outcomes.
- 2.6  : In residential locations, the applicant shall demonstrate that noise, on site and from vehicles entering and leaving the facility, and night lighting have been minimized to the greatest extent practicable.

## 3. Community

## Worker Safety and Employee Relations

Cultivation  sites  shall  comply  with  local  and  national labor  laws,  including  those  related  to  young  and/or underage  workers,  to  assure  adequate  worker  safety, compensation and, where applicable, on-site living conditions.

## Reasons for Standard

Cultivation site work is  potentially dangerous because of the  types  of  equipment  employed  and  the  nature  of  the work in and on water. Workers may not fully understand the risks at cultivation sites and safety instructions related to them.

Mollusk cultivation sites may be located in remote areas, requiring that staff live on site for periods to provide  security and respond to emergencies. Conditions of employment for mollusk cultivation site employees or subcontracted workers must reflect these special demands, in addition to provision of fair wages, fair working hours and employee benefits according to national laws.

## Implementation

At  a  minimum,  the  owners  of  certified  cultivation  sites shall provide legal wages, a safe working environment and adequate living conditions when it is required that workers live on the  farm.  Cultivation  site  management  must demonstrate that the facility complies with national or local laws governing the rights and conditions of employment of  cultivation  site  personnel, including casual labor and work by subcontractors.

Local and national laws notwithstanding, cultivation sites

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

shall comply with International Labour Organization conventions  and standards regarding forced or bonded labor,  and  employment  of  workers  under  legal  working age.

Safety equipment such as goggles, gloves, hard hats and life jackets shall be provided free of charge when appropriate  and  kept  in  working  order.  A  plan  shall  be available  for  obtaining prompt  medical  assistance  for injured or ill workers.

Mollusk  cultivation  operations  that  operate  vessels  shall comply with national laws governing the safety of commercial vessels. In the absence of national regulations, vessels shall be operated in compliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)  regulations,  where  they  apply.  Cultivation  site management shall ensure that all staff and crew hold the appropriate  maritime  qualifications  to  operate  vessels used for cultivation operations.

For  subcontractors  who  work  at  the  cultivation  site,  the subcontracting companies  or  individuals  shall provide documents to prove they are legally licensed or registered  to work in the relevant jurisdiction.

During facility inspection, the auditor will evaluate whether conditions comply with labor laws. The auditor will also interview a random sample of workers to obtain their opinions about wages, safety and living conditions. Any discrepancies will be investigated.

## Mollusk Farms

## 4. Environment

## Production Carrying Capacity

Cultivation  sites  shall  be  of  an  appropriate  scale  and operated so they do not exceed the production carrying capacity  of  the  water  body  or  disrupt  the  ecosystem's natural function and ability to support existing communities.

## Reasons for Standard

Bivalve  mollusks  are  efficient  filter  feeders.  Where  they  are cultivated in high densities, there is potential for the production carrying capacity (PCC) of the water body to be exceeded. The risk of this is higher in enclosed water bodies such as estuaries and  embayments,  and  where  the  stocks  of  natural  and cultivated bivalve molluscan shellfish are relatively high.

If the  rate  at  which  phytoplankton  is  removed  by  the shellfish exceeds the rate at which the ecosystem refreshes the supply - whether by tidal flushing or primary production in situ - the reduced availability of food can have a negative impact  on  the  growth  and  health  of  shellfish  and  other organisms.

Aside  from  ecosystem-level  effects,  which  are  likely  to  be experienced  under  a  limited  set  of  circumstances,  high stocking densities can be detrimental on a local scale, which has implications for growth rates and yield within the mollusk cultivation site.

## Background

Production carrying capacity is a fundamental component of sustainability  in  bivalve  culture.  It  is  thus  integral  to  any management  and  regulatory  regime  applied  to  bivalve farming.  Although  conceptually  simple,  PCC  is  difficult  to measure  in  practice  and  thus  challenging  to  implement according to an auditable standard.

Because  bivalves  are  suspension  feeders  dependent  on waterborne  delivery  of  food  (largely  phytoplankton),  highdensity culture can result in food limitation and thus reduced bivalve growth. In the scientific literature, this phenomenon is  referred  to  as  seston  depletion.  For  this  reason,  PCC defined  by  food  limitation  is  an  indicator  of  sustainability. However, phytoplankton is the base of the trophic web, and a PCC  definition derived from chlorophyll is also an ecosystem wide indicator  of sustainability.  This  ecosystem aspect    is  a  rare  but  highly  desired  quality  in  potential standards.

Although  chlorophyll  is  technically  practical  to  measure  in coastal  waters,  seston  depletion  occurs  over  large  spatial scales  for  intermittent  time  periods  and  is  impractical  to document, even in research programs. Simulation modelling has been successfully applied to seston depletion but is too complex for routine use in an aquaculture standard.

Instead, the growth trajectory of cultured animals provides a direct,  sensitive  and  reliable  approach  to  assessing  food limitation in bivalves. Bivalve growth integrates the effects of changing  environmental  conditions over time, such  as intermittent  periods  of  food  limitation,  and  consequently summarizes  the  performance  in  the  long  term.  In  short, reduced food availability results in reduced bivalve growth, which can be quantified.

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

## Implementation

Cultivation sites are usually located in water bodies known to support high rates of growth for bivalves. Depending on local management,  there  may  be  a  predefined  limit  to  the  area available  for  cultivation  based  on  what  is  known  about  the productivity and food availability for bivalve shellfish locally.

There  may  also  be  existing  monitoring  programs  to  collect physical, chemical and biological data, which can be used to ensure that mollusk cultivation sites do not have a measurable effect on the wider ecosystem or water body. However, some monitoring should also take place at the local cultivation site level.  Regulatory  programs  within  relevant  jurisdictions  may address production carrying capacity by setting science-based area  or  farm  production  limits  to  prevent  the  exceeding  of potentially limiting production levels.

When previous regulatory  programs,  zonal  management  or third-party studies, or pre-existing environmental impact assessments  do  not  take  production  carrying  capacity  into account, the standard of review will be based on a monitoring approach consisting of the following components:

- · regular sampling of shell length and tissue weight, and/or condition index at farm sites
- · establishment of reference sites for similar measurements
- · verified (georeferenced) sample location information.

Since different methods or combinations of methods may  be required  by  different  jurisdictions,  no  preferred  method  is specified in the BAP standards, only that whatever method is used shall  be  undertaken  using  methods  of  sampling  and analysis  that  conform  to  generally  accepted  international standards. GSA and stakeholder partners are developing new global  standards  for  Area  Management  that  will  extend  to monitoring programs and sampling methods.

All applicants for BAP certification shall:

- · For established farms, provide evidence of responsible practices in setting stocking densities appropriate to local conditions for a period of at least three years prior to application or for as long as the cultivation site has been in operation.
- · Demonstrate via records that growth rate and meat yield are taken into account when setting stocking density for mollusks and in general husbandry practices at the cultivation  site.

Either the applicant shall comply with one or more of the following:

- · Show evidence (e.g., pre-existing research on carrying capacity modeling) that the total cultivation effort within the water body does not exceed the production carrying capacity of that water body. This evidence shall be provided to and verified by GSA or an agreed independent  reviewer.
- · Demonstrate a suitable monitoring and/or regulatory regime, and/or zonal management program is in place to ensure future levels of cultivation do not exceed the production carrying capacity of the water body.

Or the applicant shall write and implement a monitoring plan for the cultivation site to:

- · Conduct a monitoring program, including regular sampling of shell length and tissue weight, and/or

## Mollusk Farms

condition index at farm sites, and establish and monitor a reference site as per established protocols or those developed in  GSA Area Management standards.

- · Maintain stocking densities within the farm site to maintain more than 70 percent of the monitored variable (shell length and tissue weight and/or condition index) at the reference site for a minimum of three culture cycles prior to application or for as long as the site has been in operation, if less than three culture cycles.
- · Produce a management plan that describes the corrective or collaborative actions to be taken when production carrying capacity at the farm or ecosystem level is  exceeded.

If, by reference to the reference sites, it is clear that external factors are responsible for changes in PCC rather than cultivation activity, then this should be reflected in the management plan. In anticipation of more rigorous data collection, it is expected that farmers will collect data on stocking density and production levels from the time they apply for certification.

- 4.2.2  :  The  applicant  shall  conduct  regular  sampling  of  shell  length  and  tissue  weight,  and/or  condition  index  or  other  relevant growth variables at farm sites, and this value shall not be  less  than  70  percent  of  the  respective  metric  at  a  reference site for a minimum of three culture cycles prior to application or for as long as the site has been in operation.

## 5. Environment

## Wild and Hatchery Seed Supply

The collection of wild mollusk larvae, seed or juveniles, or the purchase of seed or stock for growout from third parties whose seed is sourced from wild stocks shall be carried out with the aim of ensuring that the level of removal of wild seed is sustainable, and the collection or harvest method is environmentally sensitive. The translocation of seed mollusks from hatchery- or wildderived stocks must also avoid the importation or spread of alien invasive or pest species.

## Reasons for Standard

The use of shellfish hatcheries is increasing, and with it comes the ability  to  ship  larvae  and  juveniles  of  various species among both countries and continents. In the past, this has had serious consequences involving disease introductions, such as the disease impacts related to the Bonamia ostreae oyster  parasite  into  Europe,  presumably with  oyster seed.  The  movement  of  oyster  herpes  virus  is  an example of a significant present  risk.

While some regions have developed successful hatchery production of mollusk seed, and ongoing research promises continued advances in seed production, most mollusk aquaculture is still currently dependent on the availability and utilization of wild mollusk seed for both seabed and suspended culture. Some regions have developed techniques for the rearing of seed but are still dependent upon the harvesting of wild broodstock as the source of the larvae.

Unregulated and unsustainable harvesting of wild seed or broodstock from shellfish beds risks future depletion of mollusk stocks and a consequent decline of the broodstock needed to ensure further seed production. These mollusk stocks may also provide a food source for other animals, such as birds, fish and other predators, either directly or in the role they play in providing a habitat and refuge for  other marine organisms.

Harvesting of wild seed or broodstock from permanent mollusk beds should therefore be carried out in a way that is sustainable and with harvesting techniques and equipment that are environmentally sensitive. Alternative sources of mollusk seed, the harvest from which is generally considered environmentally sustainable, are  ephemeral beds, collection of planktonic juveniles through the deployment of settlement collectors or hatchery-produced seed.

Hatchery production can also potentially alter genetic diversity in native populations by introducing genetic material from other regions within the species or by amplifying certain genetic groups through selective breeding.

Translocation of molluscan shellfish has in the past been implicated in the introduction or spread of alien invasive and other pest species, as well as biotoxins and diseases that pose a threat to commercial shellfish species, wild mollusk populations and the wider marine environment. Therefore, when moving mollusk broodstock or seed, care must be

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

exercised to ensure that unwanted organisms are not transported to water bodies where they are not already present.

## Implementation

Many species are now being produced from hatchery seed, and this is expected to increase in the future. The aim of the BAP program is to promote hatchery-based aquaculture while ensuring that the movement of hatchery stocks does not transmit diseases or pests or have negative impacts on the genetics of wild populations. If wild mollusk seed is used in preference to hatchery seed, this must be for justifiable reasons. For example, if there is no local availability of hatchery seed, if there are significant disease or genetic impact risks associated with bringing in hatchery seed, or if the supplies of wild seed are derived from demonstrably sustainable, wild stocks.

In order for a cultivation site to prove that its mollusk seed supply originates from a sustainable source or is free from alien invasive species, diseases or parasites, it is important that any seed movements into or leaving the cultivation site have sufficient documentation to describe or fulfill the following:

- · The name and contact details of the harvester or producer of the mollusk broodstock or  seed.
- · The geographic location of the mollusk stocks or facility from which the broodstock, seed or juvenile mollusks were produced.
- · The name, reference or any other identification mark of any vessels used in harvesting wild mollusks, together with relevant contact  details.
- · A description of the type of collection method used in harvesting the wild broodstock or seed mollusks.
- · A copy of any regulatory documentation required under applicable national legislation concerning the harvest or collection of wild  mollusks.
- · A copy of any regulatory documentation showing that seed has been transported and imported as required under applicable national legislation concerning hatchery-produced seed.
- · Seed mollusk supplies shall only be obtained from facilities that do not contain diseases or parasites that could result in the infection of cultivation areas or affect a cultivation site's biosecurity plan or status.
- · Where legislation does not apply, hatchery seed moving between biological regions must have documentation of a high health program at the originating hatchery that includes monitoring for OIEreportable shellfish diseases.
- · Where legislation does not apply, efforts to address genetic concerns specific to species and geographic regions where the seed will be out-planted must be documented.

To prevent  any  introduction  or  spread  of  alien  invasive  or pest species to a cultivation site, observations of previously unknown marine species in/on stocks of  mollusks  brought into the cultivation site shall be monitored. All  shellfish health and movement documentation shall be securely stored.

## 6. Environment Sediment Effects

Cultivation areas shall be located and operated so that they minimize  negative  impacts  on  sediment  quality  and  the benthic community, and that any effects are localized and at an acceptable level for the receiving environment.

## Reasons for Standard

Mollusk cultivation areas have  the  potential to cause environmental  harm  due  to  sediment  accumulation  under sea-based  cultivation sites or at the effluent outfall of landbased  cultivation sites. The  causes  include  fall off of pseudofeces,  feces,  dead  mollusks  and  accretion  of  fine sediment.  In addition, the presence of the aquaculture facility can change  the  hydrodynamic  conditions  and  result  in  a change in sediment  characteristics  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of the  facility.

The addition of substrates such as shells, raking the seabed  to remove silt and increase settlement areas, and other practices can  also  affect  sediment  composition.  These  changes may constitute a physical alteration in the biotope, particularly when compounded  by  the  deposition  of  shells  or  live  mollusks underneath a suspended culture  plot.

Culture activities associated with seabed preparation, predator removal or harvesting activities (including mechanical or hydraulic dredging, trawling, suction or water jetting) can result in sediment  plumes  that  accumulate  or  affect  critical  habitats. These plumes can extend outside site boundaries.

Additionally, the accumulation of  organic matter has potential implications  for  benthic  biodiversity  due  to  related  effects, including  oxygen depletion and increased levels of  hydrogen sulfide. Where shell is deposited, the change in texture of the seabed can represent a habitat alteration with implications for enhancements or declines in species richness and  diversity.

The  occurrence  or  severity  of  these  effects  varies  greatly among locations and regions depending on local tidal geography,  benthic  ecology  and  the  size  of the mollusk cultivation  site.  Although  biological  effects  can  be  measured, sediment  monitoring is the most practical means of detecting change.

## Implementation

Cultivation areas are usually located following a hydrographic,  biological  and  physical  study  of  the  site  to determine that cultivation operations shall not have significant negative  impacts  on  animal  populations  that comprise the benthos under or near the cultivation site.

Generally,  the  location  of  a  cultivation  site  is  the  most significant step in determining and mitigating its ecological impact. Local regulations can require consideration of the effects of tides and currents on the dispersal of sediment. Additionally, site selection can be required to be based on the similarity of the existing environment, such as favoring muddy habitats over sandy seabed.

When  a  cultivation  site  is  in  operation,  maintenance  and husbandry practices can limit the effects of deposition. At some cultivation sites, regular cleaning or dredging of the seabed under suspended culture plots has been  undertaken to remove empty shells and disperse or remove the built-up mud  and  pseudofeces  with  the  aim  of  maintaining  the

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

sediment characteristics of the original habitat.

Allowable benthic impacts may be set as conditions in the operating  permits  for  the  cultivation  site,  often  defined  in terms of one or more of several chemical properties of the sediments. Sometimes  these are then correlated with species  density  and  diversity  determinations,  which  are based  on  prior  knowledge  of  local  sediment  biology  or analysis of sediment reference samples collected from the cultivation site location.

Because biological sampling of sediments requires special expertise and is time-consuming and  expensive,  chemical sediment properties are usually used as leading indicators of sediment  condition.  Biological  sampling  is  only required  in some jurisdictions if an indicator trigger point   is exceeded. Chemical  indicators  used  for  this  purpose  include  sulfide, REDOX potential, total organic carbon or total volatile solids, or  visual  inspection  with  documentation  by  video.  Some methods are better suited to some environments than others.

In  general,  it  can  be  assumed  there  will  be  some  level  of change to the benthic environment  within  the  immediate footprint  of  a  cultivation  site.  Local  regulations  regarding monitoring of within-site effects - and what might be deemed 'acceptable' levels of effect - shall be followed.    A basic requirement of sediment sampling should be an attempt to monitor effects outside the cultivation site, perhaps comparing  near-field  and  far-field  effects  upstream  and downstream.

Since different methods or combinations of methods may be required by different jurisdictions based on local hydrographic or benthic conditions, no preferred method is specified in the BAP standards, only that whatever method is used  shall be undertaken  using standard methods  of sampling  and  analysis  that  conform  to  generally  accepted international standards.

## Mollusk Farms

## 7. Environment

## Predator and Wildlife Interactions

Mollusk cultivation sites shall manage physical interactions with wildlife and not negatively impact the biodiversity of adjacent ecosystems.

## Reasons for Standard

Mollusk cultivation is carried out in a range of coastal habitats ranging from coastal lands, intertidal shallows, shallow soft sediments along the open coast and sheltered estuaries to deep-water fjords and rías. While mollusk culture operations contribute a variety of ecosystem services, including habitat generation, they can shift species abundance and diversity.

Wildlife  species  that  interact  with  mollusk  cultivation  sites include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  diving  ducks  that  feed  on mollusks, piscivorous (fish-eating) and wading birds, invertebrate predators (e.g., cephalopods, sea stars, crabs, gastropods) and fish predators (e.g., species of the Sparid and Myliobatidae families), and fish species that aggregate around  cultivation  site structures. Wild  species  can  be attracted to mollusk cultivation sites and associated structures as a source of food or for refuge or spawning, and others may be displaced through disturbance.

Physical impacts on the seabed (digging, suction, trawling or compaction from intertidal machinery) or the removal of equipment  and  stock  can  affect  the  eggs  and  larvae  of marine species. Processes such as shading, sedimentation, trampling or prop wash can affect important associated wildlife habitats,  such as sea  grass  beds  and other submerged aquatic vegetation. Exclusion or control of predators can reduce food availability, result in entanglement or have lethal impacts on  predators.

Mollusk cultivation can have a variety of potential effects on wild species and affect wider ecosystem biodiversity. Specific interactions with the environment, such as carrying capacity and seabed nitrification, are addressed in Sections 5 and 6. Many interactions with wildlife are harmless, but in some cases, they can injure wildlife through entanglement and drowning, or damage by cultivation equipment.

Wildlife in areas designated as 'critical' or 'sensitive' habitat can be particularly vulnerable to adverse  interactions. Mollusk  cultivation  sites  may  be  required  to  adopt  special precautions if they are permitted to locate in such an area.

## Implementation

Applicants shall implement a written Wildlife Interaction Plan (WIP) that includes provisions stipulated in local laws and the cultivation site's operating permits. The WIP shall highlight specific  points  of  concern  or  ecological  sensitivity,  and itemize policies and procedures that the cultivation site will follow  to  accomplish  the  goal  of  avoiding  harm  to  wildlife while protecting the mollusk crop and cultivation site infrastructure.

All marine mammals,  seabirds and species listed as 'critically endangered' or 'endangered' in the International Union  for Conservation  of  Nature  (IUCN)  Red  List  or protected  by local  or  national  laws  shall  not  be  subject  to control  by  any  means  except  physical  exclusion,  unless human  safety  is  at  risk  or  an  independent  environmental audit  provides  justification  for  such  control,  and  specific written  permission  for  an  alternative  means of control has

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

been granted by the regulator with jurisdiction.

The WIP shall include but not be limited to:

- · A list of relevant local laws and specific conditions of the cultivation site's operating permits that apply to wildlife management and protection.
- · Identification of farm area by maps and coordinates.
- · Mapping of culture areas indicating areas of critical habitats, e.g., protected submerged aquatic  vegetation and other essential fish habitat.
- · Establishment of critical habitat buffers appropriate to site, critical habitats and environmental conditions, including depth off seabed for floating  operations.
- · Written protocols for nuisance species management, with inventory of existing  problems.
- · Monitoring as applicable for predator control methods, maintenance of structures and critical temporal events such as spawning and  migration.
- · Responsible disposal of removed predators.

- · Use of best practices with appropriate mechanical harvesting devices such as dredges and mechanical diggers to lessen impacts on benthos.
- · Conducting of harvest, seeding and culture activities to avoid conflicts with documented critical habitats (e.g., sedimentation when dredge harvesting).
- · Allowance, when possible, for mobile organisms released in the marine environment during harvest operations.
- · Periodic updates to reflect current science, regulations and recommendations.
- · Formal Environmental Impact Assessment for any application of chemical herbicides and pesticides - typically covered in permits - with mitigation undertaken where negative effects are determined.
- · A list, if applicable, of local species classified as endangered or threatened under local laws and/or listed as 'critically endangered' or 'endangered' on the IUCN Red  List.
- · Staff training and proactive searching for information and surveys on endangered or threatened species in the vicinity of the farm.
- · A report produced or reviewed by an appropriate third party that demonstrates, in the expert's opinion (given without liability), the cultivation site does not or will not have a significant detrimental effect on the habitats of IUCN RedListed species (as above) at current or proposed production levels.

## 8. Environment

## Storage and Disposal of Supplies

Fuel, lubricants and chemicals shall be stored and disposed of in a safe and responsible manner. Paper, plastic, shells and other refuse shall be disposed of in a sanitary and responsible way. Human waste and cleaning process water shall be disposed of in a sanitary and responsible way.

## Reasons for Standard

Mollusk cultivation sites use fuel, oil and grease to power and lubricate  vessels,  and  other  mechanical  devices.  Some cultivation  sites,  particularly  those  employing  vessels,  may use  antifoulants.  Other  products  employed  include  paints, disinfectants and detergents.

Fuels  and  other  chemicals  are  highly  flammable  and/or explosive, and antifoulants can be toxic. They shall therefore be considered potential hazards to workers and the environment. Spills or careless disposal of petroleum products  and  chemicals  can  affect  aquatic  organisms  and other  wildlife  in  the  immediate  vicinity,  and  result  in  water pollution over a wider area.

Cultivation sites generate waste that can  cause  pollution, odors  and  human  health  hazards  when  not  disposed    of properly.  Human  food  scraps,  dead  mollusks  and  other organic  waste  can  attract  scavengers.  Empty  plastic  bags and other containers used in cultivation site  operations  do not decompose quickly. They can be a hazard to animals that become entangled in them or ingest them.

An  environmentally  friendly  approach  shall  be  taken  to dispose of waste material, including synthetic waste (e.g., polypropylene rope, flats, marker poles, nets, cages, trays), concrete dead weights, etc.

These wastes may be stored prior to disposal at a land base from  which  the  cultivation  site  is  supplied,  as  well  as transported on boats and barges to and from the cultivation site.  Safe,  responsible  transport,  storage,  handling  and disposal of these materials are necessary at all times.

Procedures  for  the  collection  and  sanitary  disposal  of dead mollusks recovered during grading and harvest are described under biosecurity procedures in Section 7.

## Implementation

Applicants shall have a  written Materials Storage, Handling and Waste  Disposal  Plan  (MSHWDP)  that  includes  provisions stipulated  in  local  laws  and  the  cultivation  site's  operating permits, as  well  as  the  following  requirements,  if  not  so stipulated:

- · A current inventory of all hazardous materials used and wastes stored and/or disposed of by the cultivation site or on-board  vessels.

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

## 9. Environment

## Biosecurity and Disease Management

Cultivation sites shall operate with the aim of preventing the spread  of  infectious  mollusk  diseases  or  parasites,  and diseases for which mollusks can act as vectors. Monitoring for possible disease outbreaks shall be carried out, and due care shall be exercised during translocation of seed or adult stock to avoid or limit the importation and/or spread of alien invasive species or other pest and fouling organisms.

## Reasons for Standard

## Diseases and Parasites

The movement of mollusk seed or adult stock brings with   it the risk of introducing infectious diseases and parasites  of mollusks or diseases of other shellfish for which mollusks can act as a vector. Diseases and parasites of mollusks can result in  stock  mortality,  reduced  condition  (meat:shell  ratio)  or appearance,  reduced  growth  rates  and  reduced  market value.  Infectious  diseases  for  which  mollusks  can  act  as vectors  pose  a  potential  risk  to  other  commercial  shellfish species or wild shellfish populations. As there are typically no cures or remedies for mollusk diseases, monitoring must be undertaken for disease outbreaks so that any spread can be contained.

## Alien Invasive Species

Movements  of  shellfish during commercial aquaculture operations have in the past been implicated in the unintentional introduction and spread of alien invasive species.  These non-native  species  can  pose  a  potential threat to other  commercial shellfish species and wild shellfish populations, as well as the overall marine environment.

## Pest and Fouling Organisms

The presence of pest organisms may not directly interfere with or adversely affect the normal biological processes or health  of  cultivated  mollusks.  However, their  presence  can lower market values. The potential for hybridization with noncommercial mollusk species should also be avoided.

Fouling  organisms  in  aquaculture  are  acknowledged  as potentially requiring major  resources  to remove  during routine  maintenance  of  stocks  or  final  processing  of  the finished product. The negative effects of fouling can include reduced  growth  rates  of  the  mollusks,  reduced  space  for culture, increased  handling  and  processing  or  reduced market values.

## Implementation

There  are  currently  no  therapeutic  treatments  for  mollusk diseases or parasites. Alien invasive species are often very difficult to eradicate after introduction, as are other pests and fouling organisms. Therefore, prevention rather than cure is the primary driver underpinning successful Shellfish Health Management Plans (SHMPs). The SHMP operates at two geographic  scales:  the  local  cultivation  site  and  among neighboring  sites  and  aquaculture  establishments  within  a defined

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

area. Thereafter, the SHMP considers movements into and out  of  the  local  cultivation  site  from  both  national  and international perspectives.

Additionally, those staff members responsible for biosecurity and  the  health  of  shellfish  stocks  shall  ensure  compliance with  all  legal  requirements  for  disease  testing,  monitoring, shellfish movements and reporting of notifiable diseases, if these are identified or suspected.

## Cultivation Site Management Measures

The Shellfish Health Management Plan should include, but not be limited to, written biosecurity and health management procedures  and  training  of  staff  in  the  practice  of  these procedures commensurate with their level of work responsibilities, and cover:

- · Careful selection of any new culture sites with respect to any disease, parasites or other pest or fouling organisms of mollusks.
- · Careful selection of seed or adult mollusks during translocation or importation with regard to the presence of alien invasive species and other pest or fouling organisms specified in applicable national legislation, and with regard to OIE-listed diseases and parasites.
- · Monitoring for any signs of disease or unexplained high mortality  levels.
- · Reporting procedures for possible disease outbreaks or increased mortality levels in mollusk stocks, including reporting to regulatory authorities of OIE reportable diseases.
- · Monitoring for observations of previously unknown pest  or  fouling  marine  species  in/on  stocks  of mollusks brought into the cultivation site.
- · Reporting procedures for pest or fouling marine species not previously seen on the cultivation site.
- · An alert status that defines extra precautions, containment, checks on shellfish and increased vigilance if an occurrence of infectious disease is known or suspected in the region.
- · Accurate recording of all shellfish movements and transfers to, from and within the cultivation site, with due regard to applicable national shellfish movement legislation.
- · Secure storage of all shellfish health and movement documentation.
- · Cleaning of all shellfish-handling equipment before it enters or leaves the cultivation site.
- · Procedures for the sanitary disposal of dead shellfish recovered as 'normal mortality' during routine grading and husbandry operations.
- · A recovery and disposal plan for dead shellfish in the event of mass mortalities, with available equipment in place and identified services that can be called on to quickly provide assistance.

## Mollusk Farms

## Monitoring

Written procedures for shellfish disease observations, containment, diagnosis and treatment shall include:

- · Monitoring for endemic diseases, parasites, pests and fouling organisms and recording of findings and actions taken, which may or may not be mandated by national legislation.
- · Guidelines for cultivation site staff regarding reporting procedures, both internal and external, in the event of abnormal mortality levels in shellfish stocks.

## Removal of Fouling Organisms

Written procedures to help minimize or remove fouling organisms shall include:

- · Guidelines for cultivation site staff regarding how to avoid or minimize settlement of local fouling organisms.
- · Written procedures for cultivation site staff on the techniques and use of equipment to physically remove or treat fouling organisms in order to ensure minimum damage to shellfish stocks and the least possible environmental impact during disposal of fouling organisms.

## 10. Environment

## Protection of Ecologically Sensitive Areas

Mollusk  culture  operations  shall  protect  and  conserve ecologically sensitive areas with environmental attributes worthy of retention or special care. Adverse impacts upon wetland  and  intertidal  areas  removed  or  modified  for allowed purposes shall be mitigated.

## Reasons for Standard

Nearshore culture systems  can  involve  the  modification of coastal habitats. Examples include the construction of ponds for  oyster  conditioning  in  France,  modifications  of intertidal areas to create clam  habitat  and  efforts  to  gain  access  to waterways or 'harrowing' of oyster beds.

Coastal environments can include ecologically sensitive  areas that have special environmental attributes worthy of retention or special care. These areas, which can include, but are not limited to, mangrove  and  wetland  areas  and  sensitive shoreline habitat, are critical to the maintenance of productive and diverse plant and wildlife populations.  Culture facilities use different rearing methods and can be built in ecologically sensitive  areas and  adjacent  to  natural  water  bodies.  This can potentially harm sensitive areas in various ways.

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

## Implementation

The BAP standards seek to  prevent damage, if  possible, or mitigate damage where prevention is not possible. In all cases, culture  facilities  shall employ  appropriate  construction  and operation methods to protect the natural resources they  use.

Ecologically sensitive areas shall be identified and protected during construction. Facilities shall be designed and operated to prevent erosion or sedimentation due to effluent discharge, water flow or flooding that result from culture operations and facility construction.

- · If culture operations require access to water across an ecologically sensitive area, this shall only be allowed for the installation of inlet and outlet canals, pump stations and docks.
- · Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) damaged by construction  or  operations  since  1999  shall  be mitigated  by  restoration  of  an  area  of  similar  habitat three times  the  size  of  the  area  damaged  or  by  a donation of  equivalent  value  to  other  restoration projects.  This practice  is  only  allowable  if  local regulations  permit  it.
- · In cases where ESAs were damaged before 1999, the facility shall be the subject of a five-year restoration or mitigation plan. To be considered for a possible exemption, the facility shall explain the extenuating circumstances regarding the damage.

## Standards

- 10.1: When the site plan shows an ESA has been damaged by facility construction and/or operation since 1999, the loss shall have been only for allowable purposes.
- 10.2: If net loss of ecologically sensitive area occurred on facility property since 1999, the loss shall have been mitigated by restoring an area three times as large or by an equivalent donation to restoration projects.
- 10.3: For facilities constructed before 1999 and where an ESA was damaged but not restored, the applicant shall propose a plan, subject to local regulations, that within five years from the date of initial BAP certification shall restore the damaged area, mitigate the damage by restoring an equal area of similar habitat or make a donation of equivalent value to other restoration projects. Alternatively, the applicant shall provide an explanation of the extenuating circumstances regarding the damage for consideration of exemption from this standard.
- 10.4: Operation of the facility shall not lead to erosion or coastal deterioration, or cause other ecosystem damage that will not recover within the natural life cycle of the major fauna or flora damaged.
- 10.5: Unless specific permits apply, facility operations shall not alter the hydrological conditions of the surrounding watershed, and the normal flow of brackish water to mangroves or freshwater to wetlands shall not be altered.

## 11. Food Safety

## Control of Potential Food Safety Hazards

Shellfish culture practices shall prevent the introduction of potential consumer health hazards resulting from contaminated mollusk products. Threats to human health shall  be  controlled  below  regulatory  limits  through  good practices and ensured by end product testing.

## Reasons for Standard

Bivalve  shellfish  are  filter feeders  that  can  accumulate hazardous levels of biotoxins, other toxins and pathogenic microorganisms (viruses, protozoa, bacteria and helminths) in their flesh, causing them to become naturally contaminated.

In many cases, no thermal process  is  applied  to  shellfish prior to sale  to eliminate  pathogens.  Therefore,  further microbiological multiplication is likely to occur if postharvest cold  chain  is  not  maintained.  The  presence  of  biotoxins  is also  not  eliminated  by  cooking.  Good  cultivation  practices therefore require a significant awareness of external threats, in addition  to  the  implementation  of  responsive  internal management.

As mollusks are at risk of contamination by health hazards in their  aquatic  environment,  they  are  considered  high-risk foods.  Consequently  their  safety,  as  a  food-stuff,  is  highly regulated  and  is  likely  to  present  a  major  influence,  or potential limitation, to placing product on the market and the extent of export  opportunities.

Mollusks  can  be  exposed  to  a  wide  range  of  potential contaminants dependent on the culture area, culture method, chemicals  used  in  culture  and  background  water  quality. These contaminants include:

- · Microbiological: bacteria, viruses and protozoans.
- · Chemical: biotoxins, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, veterinary drugs and persistent organics.
- · Radiological: radio nuclides.

Many contaminants widely present at trace levels within the freshwater and marine environments are unlikely to compromise  product  safety.  Other  contaminants  can  be elevated  in  certain  areas  due  to  continuous  proximity  to direct  or  indirect  sources.  Alternatively,  some  areas  with generally  high  water  quality  can  be  subject  to  periodic deterioration due to intermittent discharges, pollution spills or even natural events such as algae  blooms.

The  relationship  between  contaminant  content  in  shellfish flesh  and  uptake  from  ambient  seawater  is  complex  and subject to variation according to species response to salinity and temperature. It should be noted that regulatory monitoring programs for bivalve shellfish can differ on a national

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

or regional basis as to whether they are based upon water quality (as in the United States) or shellfish flesh quality   (as in the European  Union).  Compliance  with  a  regulatory monitoring program and the appropriate standards set by a competent  national  responsible  authority  are  fundamental requirements to ensure food safety measures are translated to export market access.

As  microbiological  threats  are  often  associated  with  fecal contamination in bivalves, there is universal use of indicator organisms (e.g., fecal coliforms or Escherichia coli ). These surrogates provide an assessment of the potential for fecal contamination and therefore form the foundation of regulatory  monitoring  for  both  food  products  and  water quality.  Fecal  indicator  organisms  provide  information  to classification  schemes  to  set  management  requirements against assessed hygiene risk and control programs such as end product testing to ensure food safety.

While the principal reason for food safety standards is the protection of the consumer, it should be recognized that there are also important commercial reasons. Mollusk aquaculture contributes  a  very  small  proportion  of  the  global  trade  of fishery  products  however  they  can  be  important  in  fragile fringe coastal  economies.  International  trade  in  bivalve shellfish  is  regionalized  and,  in  many  cases,  regulatory barriers prevent countries from penetrating distant markets.

## Implementation

At  a  minimum, food  safety   management  and  monitoring shall be  conducted  in  accordance  with  national  and/or regional standards. Bivalve export/import trade requirements are  based  upon  implementation  by  national  competent authorities  that  are  designated  as  responsible  agencies  to enforce checks and controls. Some bivalve shellfish may be exempt from standards in certain cases and jurisdictions. In consequence,  cultivation  site-specific  standards  need  to operate within a national regulatory framework.

Specific  biotoxin,  chemical  and  radiological  contaminant limits in food products are generally specified by the target market.  These  can  include  action  levels  in  addition  to mandatory upper limits.

In  contrast,  microbiological  threats  are  controlled  by  a  range of  management  requirements  in  response  to  ongoing  culture area-specific quality classification. Harvest bed and facility quality  assessments  can  be  based  upon  shellfish flesh, water quality or hybrid  requirements:

- · Water-based standards: For example, the  United States and its supplier countries (e.g., Canada, Mexico, Chile and New Zealand) comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP). Water quality standards based upon fecal coliform indicators provide evaluations ranging from 'approved' and 'conditionally approved' to 'conditionally restricted' and 'restricted.'

## Mollusk Farms

- · Flesh-based standards: For example, in E.U. member states, E. coli indicator ratings include Class A, B, C and Prohibited.
- · Hybrid  water  and  flesh  standards:  Some  schemes incorporate  both  food  product  and  environmental health components. For example, New Zealand has been  highly  successful  in  utilizing  both  NSSP  and E.U. regulatory components to form a hybrid system that meets the requirements of both target markets, allowing universal export  opportunities.

Although details of classification schemes vary, in general, they incorporate similar elements:

- · Highest quality: where product is safe to eat with no additional treatment.
- · Moderate/intermittent quality: where additional requirements or treatments are needed prior to consumption.
- · Lowest quality: where consumption is  prohibited.

Classification schemes also include a requirement for an initial assessment of quality and identification of potential contamination sources with an ongoing need for reevaluation. This should include establishing the optimum representative sampling and frequency for the regulatory monitoring  program.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the indicator  test  parameter  (e.g.,  fecal  coliforms  or E.  coli levels) and testing  methodology  can  also  be  schemespecific.  Details  should  therefore  be  obtained  from  the responsible authority in the host country.

Management responses for intermittently contaminated areas, which are likely to form the bulk of classified areas, vary among  schemes.  Such  'conditional' classification dictates restrictions on harvesting and the type and level of post-harvest treatment (e.g., depuration or heat treatment). In  essence, these variable management responses should be proportionate to the risk.

It  should be recognized that while most regulatory programs are based on the use of fecal indicator organisms, they do not  provide  a  full  assessment  of  risk  from  specific  pathogens. Viral pathogens, in particular, can pose additional risks, as they may  be  more  resistant than indicator organisms. Consequently, mollusk culture operators should always be aware of  relevant  local  microbiological  risks  and  protect consumers as part of their due diligence commitment.

The  identification  of  hazard  analysis  critical  control  points (HACCP)  is  widely  cited  as  a  vital  requirement  in  both national and international documentation, and should form a central component within cultivation site standard practices. A HACCP system should be site-specific and relevant to the individual shellfish operation, and incorporate both preharvest  prevention  of  contamination  and  postharvest decontamination/prevention of recontamination  components.

Most regulatory  classification  schemes  are  retrospective, and  as  such  are  not  always  fully  effective  in  protecting public  health.  A  proactive  approach  to  site-specific  risks should  be  encouraged  within  good  practice.  Ideally,  a  risk management approach is responsive to changing conditions by  establishing  a  matrix  of  risk  scores  throughout  the

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

environmental  and  production  cycle.  This  allows  dynamic monitoring and precautions proportionate with risks.

For example, shellfish that are primarily cooked present a lower  risk  than  those  consumed  raw  for  microbiological risks. Conversely, however, cooking may increase toxicity for biotoxins, and cooking to retain organoleptic attributes does not denature norovirus. At times of low risk, reduced depuration duration may align with national guidance, while at times of increased risk, enhanced depuration may be advisable  -  ranging  up  to  voluntarily  ceasing  all  harvesting.

All proactive management systems need to be based upon direct  or  indirect  measures  of  environmental  or  shellfish quality.  Surveillance  monitoring  can  examine  preharvest shellfish quality (e.g., deployment of defensive biomonitoring),  water  quality  at  site  boundaries  (including surrogate  water  quality  parameters  such  as  turbidity  and salinity) or source loading data (e.g., riverine gauging, rainfall data or combined sewer overflow spill data).

The use of external data sources, such as satellite imagery and  buoy-mounted  fluorimeters  for  harmful  algal  bloom monitoring or alerts from polluters, to assess risk is likely to be of increasing importance in predicting threats. Access to external data sources will vary among nations.

Other  emerging  aquaculture  trends  include  the  increasing importance  of  polyculture  systems,  which  could  also be adopted through a desire to attain an enhanced accreditation status for an aquaculture operation (e.g., bivalve culture  in association  with  finfish  culture  to  improve  water  quality). Care should be adopted to prevent potential crosscontamination with pathogens or contaminants (e.g., residual drugs used in support of finfish health). Appropriate monitoring/ control systems need to be  developed.

Every shellfish culture setting is unique. Operator knowledge of specific species' responses  to the external marine environment is critical to ensure consistent production of safe shellfish.

## 12.  Traceability

## Record-Keeping Requirement

To establish product traceability, the following data shall be recorded for each culture unit and each production cycle:

- · culture unit identification  number
- · unit area
- · common and scientific names of shellstock cultivated
- · stocking date
- · quantity of seed stocked
- · source(s) of seed
- · chemical use
- · harvest date
- · harvest quantity
- · movement document number (if  applicable)
- · purchaser(s) (identify all if any harvest quantity goes to more than one  purchaser).

## Reasons for Standard

Product  traceability  is  a  crucial  component  of  the  BAP program.  It  interconnects  links  in  the  mollusk  production chain and allows tracing of each processed lot back to the culture  unit  and  inputs  of  origin.  Food  quality  and  safety analyses  by  accredited  laboratories  can  also  be  included. Traceability  ultimately  assures  purchasers  that  all  steps  in the production process were in compliance with environmental, social and food safety standards.

## Implementation

The traceability requirements for mollusks should  begin with a customary unit for commerce, such as a bag of shell stock, bulk  grouping  or  other  distinguishable  lot  that  is  usually restricted to harvest within one region or day. Cultivation sites may  utilize  any  traceability  system  that  meets  the  BAP requirements. This can be an online system; the cultivation site's own  in-house  database,  paper  records,  files  and documents; or a combination  thereof.

Where paper records, documents or notebooks are used, if possible,  the  information  should  also  be  transferred  to computer database files to allow electronic transmission. The original files or paper  records shall be kept to allow verification of the electronic data.

The data referenced in BAP's standards on seed sources, etc. are required for traceability. This information and other related  records  can  be  captured  on  the    sample  Product Traceability Form in Appendix I. Each form corresponds to the shipment of products on a particular day from a particular culture unit.

In  addition  to  the  requirements  for  BAP  traceability,  which naturally would include basic facility information, traceability records can include:

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

- · government registration/license numbers, where applicable
- · type of culture  unit
- · seed collection time and  method
- · unusual events that could affect quality or safety
- · results of tests for contaminants before harvest
- · harvest method and container  type
- · harvester identity
- · time produce out of water prior to receipt by processing/depuration/dispatch facility
- · use of depuration with details for application
- · cold chain storage.

The record-keeping process requires a high degree of care and organization. At large cultivation sites, managers could collect  initial  data  for  those  mollusks  for  which  they  are responsible.  A  single  clerk  could  then  be  given  the  task  of collecting the data from individual managers and transferring it to a computer database. Cultivation site management shall, of course, review the effort at intervals to verify it satisfies BAP requirements.

## Product Identity Preservation

To  assure  the  integrity  of  the  Best  Aquaculture  Practices 'star' system, traceability controls must allow verification of all  facilities  that  contribute  to  a  claim  of  multiple-star  BAPcertified status.

To ensure the proper separation and traceability of all farm inputs  and  outputs,  the  following  components  must  be  in place:

- · Farms that purchase all of their mollusk seed from BAP-certified sources shall maintain records of the sources of seed used.
- · Farms that purchase seed from both BAP- and nonBAP-certified sources shall identify all sources and have adequate systems in place  to  prevent mixing  of BAP and non-BAP production lots.
- · To enable mass balance verification of multiple-star products, certified farms shall maintain a list, including harvest dates and volumes, of the processors to which they sell or deliver products.
- · The number of backward and forward trace exercises conducted by the auditor will be determined by farm volume.

## BAP Logo Use

Use  of  the  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  logo,  a  registered trademark of the Global Seafood Alliance, for any purpose shall be approved by BAP  in advance and used in compliance with the BAP trademark usage agreement.

## Customer Complaints

The  applicant  must  prepare  and  implement  an  effective system  for  the  management  of  complaints  and  complaint data  to  control  and  correct  shortcomings  related  to  its products' compliance with the BAP standards.

## Standards

- 12.1:  Traceability  records  shall  be  maintained  for  each  of  the  specified  parameters  for  every  production  unit  and  every production  cycle  allow  tracing  of  mollusks  back  to  the  harvesting  area,  any  relaying  area  or  subsequent  handling  location, such as a dispatch/packing center or depuration center. Records  for consolidated batches  should  retain original documentation from the differing harvesting and handling locations that will aid traceability.
- 12.2: The facility shall operate an effective record-keeping system that provides timely, organized, accurate entries, performed and overseen by a designated trained person or team responsible for collecting the data, ensuring it is complete and accurate, and that traceability requirements are met.
- 12.3: The facility shall keep complete and accurate records for each culture unit and production cycle, including the culture unit identification number, unit area and species.
- 12.4: The facility shall keep complete and accurate records concerning chemical use at the facility.
- 12.5: The facility shall maintain complete and accurate records of the sources and numbers of seed stocked, and  stocking dates for each culture unit.
- 12.6: Complete and accurate records regarding harvest date, harvest quantity, movement document number (if applicable) and processing plant(s) or purchaser(s) shall be maintained. If product lots are destined to more than one plant or purchaser, each lot shall be separately identified.
- 12.7: In  order  to  use  the  BAP  logo,  facilities  shall  have  such  use  approved  and  registered  in  advance  with  BAP management.
- 12.8:  The  facility  shall  keep  records  of  any  customer  complaints  related  to  its  products'  compliance  with  the  BAP  standards.
- 12.9: The facility shall keep records of investigations of such complaints and actions taken to address/correct them.

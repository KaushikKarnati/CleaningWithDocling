## IFFO RS CoC V2 (DRAFT1) Global Standard for Responsible Supply

## General Guidance

## Compliance ratings

Each of the requirements of the IFFO RS CoC V2 Standard must be awarded one of the following conformance levels as defined by the Auditor Guidance:

Full compliance - The Applicant meets the intent of all IFFO RS CoC V2 Standard requirements.

At the initial certification audit all Non compliances will need to be addressed in an effective action plan and closed off or downgraded prior to certification.

Minor Non-conformance Definition - Any non-conformity which does not adversely affect the health or safety of a product. Basically, where absolute compliance to the Statement of Intent has not been met but on the basis of objective evidence the conformity of the product is not in doubt.

A Minor Non Compliance identified at the initial certification the CB shall not issue a certificate until these have all been addressed in an effective action plan that as been agreed by the CB .

## Definition of an Effective Action Plan

For an action plan to be deemed to effective it shall address the following key areas:

-  An appropriate time frame to address and resolve the noncompliance shall be given
-  A root cause analysis of why the noncompliance was identified
-  What actions shall need to be incorporated into the policy and procedures to ensure that future non compliances shall not occur
-  An  appropriate  person  to  oversee  that  the  noncompliance  has  been  resolved  shall  be identified

At  an  annual  surveillance  a  raised  Minor  Non-Conformity  does  not  prevent  the  Applicant  from maintaining its certification to the IFFO RS CoC V2 Standard, but an action plan is presented and this shall be a focus of the subsequent surveillance audit. If subsequently the organisation is deemed to still fall short of Full Compliance, the auditor will upgrade the non-compliance and award a Major NonConformity and corrective action will be required before certification can be maintained.

Note- The only exception to this rule is under circumstances where a Minor Non-Conformity is raised due to records not being maintained for a sufficiently long duration. In these circumstances, the Minor Non-Conformity will remain Minor as long as records continue to be built up. This is to reflect the impossibility of creating 3 years of records in 1 year.

Major  Non-conformance DefinitionAny  non-conformity  other  than  critical,  which  may  result  in failure for health or safety and which cannot be eliminated by re-work or reduced to a minor nonconformity. In addition, this could also be when a requirement of the IFFO RS Standard has been addressed but there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has been properly controlled or implemented.  For example; the Traceability System is found to be flawed to meet the requirements of Statement of Intent or any clause of the standard.

All Major Non-Conformity must be closed off or downgraded before the Applicant can be certified to the IFFO RS CoC V2 Standard.

If the CB cannot close off or down grade a major noncompliance in a period of 3 calendar months for new application and 1 calendar month for an annual surveillance from the point at which it is raised the CB will need to instigate a full re-audit.

At this point in the process if it is an existing client's their IFFO RS CoC certificate shall be suspended until this re-audit has been conducted. If this re-audit determines that no non compliances were found then the client's certificate shall be re-instated.

Downgrade definition - the applicant can provide evidence which challenges the auditor's original decision on the grading of the original non-compliance sufficiently to allow a lower grading on the non-compliance to be issued

Critical Non-conformance Definition Any non-conformity which may result in hazardous or unsafe for individuals and animals. In addition, this could also be a regulatory violation or a complete marine ingredient  safety  failure  to  implement  a  requirement  of  the  IFFO  RS  Standard.  For  example;  the Auditor  could  provide  evidence  to  show  that  the  Marine  Ingredients  intended  to  be  labelled  as compliant were found not to have originated from an Approved Fishery or By-product for the IFFO RS programme,  or  the  auditor  has  been  deliberating  mislead  on  the  credibility  of  the  information provided by the applicant,  the Applicant shall not gain certification.

It could also mean more generally that the Applicant has broken any legal obligation which puts food safety, employee safety, or worker welfare at risk. This does not necessarily need to relate to a specific requirement in the IFFO RS CoC V2 Standard, but the details of the critical non-conformity must be detailed by the auditor.

In the event of a Critical Non-Conformity, the auditor will end the on-site assessment immediately if the safety of the auditor is compromised. The CB must not grant certification to the Applicant, and any future applications to the programme by the Applicant must include documented evidence of the policies and/or systems put in place to ensure the Critical Non-Conformity does not re-occur. It is

proposed that a period of 6(six) months should be given before an applicant can be reapply for the certification to the standard to ensure that the systems to prevent this critical noncompliance reoccurring have been fully embedded into the applicant's quality management systems and culture

If a critical noncompliance is raised for an existing client, the CB shall immediately suspend the IFFO RS CoC certificate pending a full investigation by the CB and if the noncompliance is up held the client shall have its certificate withdrawn and it shall not be allowed to re-apply for the standard for a period of 6(six)months.

## TRANSISTION Process oF Current Certificate Holders to New CoC Standard

The new V2 IFFO RS V2 standard shall be approved by the GBC and released on the IFFO RS website. The new V2 IFFO RS CoC shall become effective after a period of no longer than 6 months after this release date.

A transition process for existing CoC Holders to adopt this new standard will be approved by the IFFO RS GBC. The plan will be that all valid certificates to the IFFO RS CoC V1 shall be honoured by the IFFO RS approved CBs for 1(one) year only after the new standard becomes effective.

No  re-certifications  or  new  certifications  to  version  1  of  the  CoC  shall  be  issued  by  the approved CBs after the date the new standard Version 2 is released . This will effectively mean that  no  re-certification  or  new  application  audits  shall  take  place  up  to  a  period  2  (two) months prior to the  IFFO  RS  CoC  Version  2  release  date  to  allow  the  CB  enough  time  to conduct the ensure certification process to Version 1 in a timely manner. If the process is not completed to time, then a IFFO RS CoC Version 1 certificate will not be issued.

Any new applications are certifications within this time period of no auditing to IFFO RS CoC Version 1 until Version 2 comes into effect will be placed in a holding position until the Version 2  is  ready  to  be  certified  against.  For  the  case  of  recertifications  the  CBs  will  be  asked  to extend a client'scertificate to take into account this time period when they cannot be audited and certified

Note- rationale for this 6-month time period will allow IFFO RS to undertake auditor training with the approved CBs and allow new and current CoC applicants or clients to become familiar with the new requirements within V2 IFFO RS CoC Standard.

## Clause-by-Clause Guidance

## SECTION 1 - General Principles of Traceability

1.1 The applicant shall have a documented and signed policy that states that they are committed to achieving and adhering to the requirements of the IFFO RS Chain of Custody Standard.

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                                                                        | Minor Non-Conformity                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| N/A                       | The applicant has not documented its  commitment to the IFFO RS Chain of  Custody Standard. | The applicant has a document that states that  they are committed to the IFFO RS Chain of  Custody Standard, but the document/policy has  not been approved  or ratified by the site's CEO  or an equivalent senior manager. | The applicant site has a written  commitment to the IFFO RS Chain of  Custody Standard. This document has  been approved and signed by the  site's CEO or an equivalent senior  manager. |

## Additional Notes

Policy must be signed by the person with overall responsibility for the site. The rationale for this clause is to ensure that there is senior management commitment to the implementations of this standard within the applicant's QMS and to support the staff whose role it is to enforce compliance.

- 1.1.1 The applicant shall have a process to ensure that this policy is communicated to all staff within the site.

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                                  | Minor Non-Conformity                                                                                           | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| N/A                       | No attempts to communicate policy made  to all staff. | The applicant can demonstrate that the policy  has been communicated but has not included  all relevant staff. | The applicant can demonstrate that  this policy has been fully  communicated to  all  staff. For  example, during new staff inductions,  staff training etc |

## Additional Notes

The rationale of this clause is to re-enforce that all staff in the applicant's organisation are aware of this commitment to this standard to drive positive behaviour to ensure they continuously meet the requirements of the standard. This policy could be communicated through various channels such as training workshops, new staff inductions, posters etc.

- 1.2 The applicant shall have a documented and effective supplier approval and monitoring system to ensure that incoming marine ingredients intended to be identified as compliant, are sourced from an approved fishery, or a certified supplier that holds a valid IFFO RS or IFFO RS CoC certification.

| Critical Non-Conformity                                                                                                                                                                                        | Major Non-Conformity                                                                                                                                           | Minor Non-Conformity   | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No monitoring of suppliers and input  material for IFFO RS compliant  marine ingredients that leads to non- compliant products including that  from possible IUU sources being  labelled as IFFO RS compliant. | System not operational or is not  effective at being able to differentiate  between different suppliers.  Certification status of each supplier is  not clear. | N/A                    | The applicant will have an up-to-date system of  IFFO RS certified suppliers and be able to  demonstrate that they hold a valid IFFO RS or  IFFO RS CoC certification. |

## Additional Notes

An Auditor confirms suppliers are certified against the IFFO RS Factory or CoC Standard with the correct species in scope associated with the information found in the certificate code.

The applicant shall ensure that only marine ingredients that has been produced in an IFFO RS certified site from an approved IFFO RS fishery or recognised IFFO RS -MSC fishery are used to produce these compliant marine ingredients.

1.2.1 IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients that are purchased from a third-party agent, or broker that does not physically handle or own the certified product. The applicant shall have documents/evidence provided from these suppliers in place, to prove the identity of the marine ingredient back to an approved fishery or by product.

Critical Non-Conformity

Major Non-Conformity

Minor Non-Conformity

Full Compliance

## Additional Notes

An Auditor confirms suppliers are certified against the IFFO RS Factory or CoC Standard with the correct species in scope associated with the information found in the certificate code.

The applicant shall ensure that only marine ingredients that has been produced in an IFFO RS certified site from an approved IFFO RS fishery or recognised MSC fishery are used to produce these compliant marine ingredients.

Auditor note: the applicant will be exempt from this clause if the third-party agent, trader or broker is certificated to the IFFO RS CoC Standard. If so, then clause 1.2 will need to be satisfied.

If an agent or broker does own the product then they will be treated as any other supplier and need an IFFO RS CoC certificate, if they do not wish to be certified then they will be treated as a subcontractor to the applicant and follow the requirements in Section 3

1.2.1.1 IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients that are purchased from a third-party agent, or broker that does not physically handle or own the certified product. The applicant shall ensure that they have been trained/made aware/informed on the requirements to maintain the product integrity status of these certified materials and shall sign a form stating their commitment to the IFFO RS CoC standard .

## Additional Notes

An Auditor confirms this training has been conducted and there is a signed agreement between the applicant and agent/broker

- 1.3 A current batch/lot record of all IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients received by the applicant shall be maintained.

## Additional Notes

A batch/lot record is required for the traceability verification test (see clause 2.5 requirements) and volume reconciliation and will support in fraud mitigation from duplication or substitution.

## 1.3.1 The batch/lot record shall contain the following information;

-  Supplier name
-  Supplier unique IFFO RS certificate number
-  Volume of IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients received from each supplier.
-  Key Data Element (KDE) information on the source fishery for whole fish to include, fishing vessel(s), species, catch area and date of landing
-  Key Data Element (KDE) information on source processing a factory for by-product trimmings to include factory name, species and date of processing

## Additional Notes

It is important to record this data as it can be used to document where and how much material the applicant is using to a) ensure that a credible statement and assurance can be given to their customer and b) can be used to mitigate potential acts of fraudulent behaviour through duplication or substitution

If a KDE system is adopted, then a lot of this standard could be streamlined into a verification of data input into a third-party digital platform.

1.4 The applicant shall have a documented product management system in place to demonstrate how IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients are segregated and labelled from non-certified product during all the processes within the Applicants organisation.

| There is found to be  deliberate mis-labelling  of products, or gross negligence .

Or the applicant has some  processes in place but there is evidence of  some non-segregation leading to potential  mis-identification of products. | The documented processes that  are in place could be improved to  reduce the risk of mixing of IFFO RS  certified with non-certified  materials. | The applicant has a demonstrably  effective product management  system in place to keep labelled IFFO  RS product  separated  from marine  ingredients that is produced from  non-approved material or from a  fishery in the IFFO RS Improver  Programme. |

## Additional Notes

Also see requirements for clauses 2.1 and 2.2. The product management system will be appropriate to the context of the organisation. If for example the organisation only ever deals with IFFO RS compliant products then this could be a specific document/ statement.

If the organisation deals with multiple product lines of similar non-compliant product the organisation will have to document in their product management system how IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients are kept segregated and labelled from non-compliant products, paying particular attention to key handing points (see subclauses for 2.1 and 2.2) where risk of mis-identification / substitution could occur.

- 1.5 A documented non-conforming product procedure shall be in place and implemented effectively by the Applicant to deal with any nonconformances detected as a result of a failure of the Marine ingredients product management system stated in 1.4 which may result in IFFO RS compliant Marine ingredients being mixed with non-compliant material.

| The applicant does not have a  process and on review by the  auditor there is  clear evidence that non IFFO RS compliant  material is being mixed with  IFFO RS compliant material and  the subsequent marine  ingredients have still been  labelled as IFFO RS compliant. | The applicant's system when reviewed  by the auditor  highlighted significant  flaws  in the system they used, which if  not reviewed and amended  could cause the compliant IFFO RS material to be  mixed with non IFFO RS material and  mislabelled. | The applicant has a documented  non-conforming product procedure,  but parts of the process are not  being complied with and  improvements could be made to  ensure it is implemented effectively . | The applicant will have a  procedure in their  product management system on how  to deal with  the case where a loss of traceability or eligibility of  IFFO RS compliant material has occurred. |

## Additional Notes

The applicants CB (see clause 1.6.3) and customer (see clause 1.6.4) will be notified in the event of a non-conforming product procedure being activated. This will usually entail the requirement to have an effective quarantine system in place for any product that was found to be outside the scope of this standard or is suspected to be due to a loss of identification and traceability.

If a non-conforming product procedure has been activated the applicant can demonstrate that this was implemented effectively.

The non-conforming product procedure would ideally be captured in the applicant's product management system.

If a non-conforming product procedure has been activated previously the applicant can show that they have implemented this effectively (though see subclauses 1.6.1 - 1.6.4).

1.6 Any Corrective actions resulting from a non-conforming products procedure shall be accurately documented;

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                                                                | Minor Non-Conformity                                                        | Full Compliance                                                                               |

## Additional Notes

Some of sub-clauses 1.6.1 - 1.6.4 may not be relevant if the applicant has not been required to instigate a non-conforming products procedure.

Any previous non-conformances that the applicant has raised should not be flagged as an NC for the purpose of this audit if the applicant can demonstrate how these NCs were acted on, and safeguards put in place to reduce the risk of a similar NC occurring in the future.

- 1.6.1 These actions shall identify authorised responsible personnel to handle the remedial actions required based on their severity or risk.

## Additional Notes

Responsible personnel need to be identified so somebody has ownership of the corrective action.

1.6.2 All remedial actions shall be part of a corrective action plan to mitigate these incidents happening again in future and shall be time specified.

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity        | Minor Non-Conformity                                                                                                                            | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They are shown to be part of a plan to  ensure these incidents are mitigated against in  future.   OR  No non-conforming product procedure activated. |

## Additional Notes

Any remedial actions will inform improvements made to the product management system (clause 1.4) and/ or non-conforming product procedure (clause 1.5) to ensure similar incidents are mitigated in future.

1.6.3 The applicant's certification body shall be notified in the event of product recall being actioned as result of this non-conforming product procedure being activated.

## Additional Notes

It is essential that the CB is made aware of any non-conformances against the standard between audits.

## Additional Notes

Ideally the customer should be notified as soon as possible so they do not inadvertently claim that the product is IFFO-RS certified.

## Additional Notes

This is standard good practice. Where a Minor Non-Conformity is raised due to records not being maintained for a sufficiently long duration. In these circumstances, the Minor Non-Conformity will remain Minor as long as records continue to be built up. This is to reflect the impossibility of creating 3 years of records in 1 year.

## Additional Notes

Note that the requirements of this clause may not be required for organisations that are not undertaking any processing (e.g. traders).

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) evaluates the entire production process step by step from delivery intake to packaging and transport of the completed product. During the HACCP any stages where the product could be subject to physical, microbiological or chemical contamination are identified. Measures are put in place for those deemed critical (i.e. temperature controls, cleaning etc.) and these are regularly monitored to ensure that the end product is safe for human consumption.

If a applicant has a GFSI certification the auditor shall check to see what areas are covered within these certification requirements to help prove compliance with this standard clause

## Additional Notes

Note that the requirements of this clause may not be required for organisations that are not undertaking any processing (e.g. traders).

Threat Assessment Critical Control Point (TACCP) is concerned with the prevention of deliberate and intentional food fraud . This can take the form of substitution of ingredients, passing off of one foodstuff for another, false or misleading statements for economic gain that could impact public health, product tampering, fake or incorrect labelling etc.

Vulnerability Assessment Critical Control Point (VACCP) identifies how vulnerable various points in the supply chain are to the threat of economically motivated adulteration.

If an applicant has a GFSI certification the auditor shall check to see what areas are covered within these certification requirements to help prove compliance with this standard clause

## SECTION 2 - Traceability Verification and Labelling

2.1 IFFO RS compliant Marine ingredients or the finished product shall be labelled or otherwise be identified in a manner that ensures traceability is maintained during the following key traceability steps if an IFFO RS logo or certified claim is to be made on the applicant's finished product:

| There are  no processes in place  to  enable traceability of IFFO RS Compliant  materials and finished products.  AND the  finished product is still identified/  claimed to be IFFO RS certified. | There are  some processes in place  to  enable the traceability of IFFO RS  Compliant materials and finished  products, but there is strong evidence that  they are often ineffective . The traceability  process is inadequate to ensure that  information remains with the IFFO RS  Compliant product at all stages outlined in  clauses 2.1.1 - 2.1.8. | There are processes in place to  enable the traceability of IFFO RS  Compliant materials and finished  products, but there is some  evidence that they  may not always  be effective/ improvements could  be made . | Applicant ensures that IFFO RS compliant  materials and finished products are  identifiable at all stages outlined in  clauses 2.1.1 - 2.1.8 with required  documentation in place. |

## Additional Notes

Documentation received with certified products needs to clearly identify the product as certified. This may include the following:

-  delivery notes,
-  invoices,
-  bills of lading, or
-  electronic information from the supplier.

Information captured upon receipt pertaining to the batch/lot record (clause 1.3.1) must not be lost during production to ensure that full traceability can be maintained (clause 2.3). If a supplier uses an internal system (such as barcodes or product codes) to uniquely identify certified products on documents, the applicant must understand the supplier's description in order to confirm the product is certified.

Additionally, it is recommended that certified products are identifiable as certified on the physical product as well as on the accompanying traceability records. This can be done by placing a sign or label on the package, container, or pallet. Organisations can use a variety of methods to identify certified products, including acronyms (e.g., 'IFFO RS'), the CoC certification code, or another internal system of identification.

Where it is impossible or impractical to label physical products, the applicant will need to demonstrate how the product can be linked with associated traceability or inventory records that specify the certified status.

The auditor should note that if associated records do not clearly identify products as certified , it is not sufficient to rely only on physical product labelling (e.g., an IFFO RS label on a container) to confirm the certified status.

At  the key traceability stages outlined in clauses  2.2.1 - 2.2.8 there is a risk that non-certified  fish products could have been mixed with  IFFO RS approved fish products. | Physical / temporal  separation of IFFO RS  approved products from non- certified products is apparent,  though there are some key  traceability stages where this  could be improved. | Throughout the production process IFFO RS  approved materials and the IFFO RS approved  finished product(s) are kept physically or  temporally separate from non-certified products,  and the applicant can provide evidence of this. |

## Additional Notes

The IFFO RS logo should be used only in connection with marine ingredients from certified fishmeal plants expressly identified in the list of certified plants in the IFFO RS website www.iffors.com The IFFO RS Chain of Custody logo should be used only in connection with the marine ingredients from certified fishmeal plants expressly identified in the Chain of Custody Certificate issued to Licensee.

The statement 'this product is IFFO RS compliant' can only be used if the marine ingredient factory and all the raw material meet the standard.

| The records have been falsified and  the applicant is duplicating or  substituting the qualities/volumes of  IFFO RS compliant marine  ingredients  N/A | No  records  of  quantities/  volumes  of  products are kept.  There  is  a  clear  discrepancy  between  calculated qualities/ volumes recorded and  does not match those losses than can be  justified  by  the  applicant's  product  processing practices, if applicable | Records are kept though inaccurate or  not  comprehensive  for  full  range  of  products. | The applicant maintains accurate up-to- date  records  of  quantities/  volumes  of  fishmeal/  fish  oil  /finished  product  bought  and  sold  across  their  entire  product range. |

## Additional Notes

To obtain the percentage of IFFO RS certified material inputs used in the applicant's operation, calculate the annual sum of certified IFFO RS marine ingredients inputs divided by total Annual sum of all marine ingredient materials used. This shall need to be reported to IFFO RS so that % of certified IFFO RS compliant material sold in the final product cannot be exceeded, therefore mitigating against potential fraud through duplication or substitution.

If no records of quantities/ volumes have been kept, the applicant will have 3 calendar months if they are a new applicant and 1 calendar month if an existing client to ensure that they have a procedure in place to ensure that they start building up records prior to the next audit. If this is the case, this will be the focus of the subsequent surveillance audit.

The auditor shall conduct a mass balance on each source of compliant IFFO RS marine ingredient to cross reference with the information supplied by the applicant

Auditor note- some calculation of a loss of mass/volume may occur as a result of processing practices- these will need to be review on an individual applicant basis and shall be justified by the applicant through documented evidence

- 2.4 The applicant shall report on input quantities and finished product quantities used on a quarterly basis to IFFO RS

## Additional Notes

The intent of this is so that IFFO RS can continuously monitor applicants input and finished product quantities between audits to ensure that % of certified IFFO RS compliant material sold in the final product cannot be exceeded.

Suggest that these volumes are recorded in a website only open to members of the IFFO RS standard and these figures will identify what is being used and where. This must be confidential, and the data protected

- 2.5 The applicant shall conduct a documented verification test of their product management system across the entire range of IFFO RS compliant Marine ingredients or by the finished product by batch/lot numbers or volume produced to ensure that full traceability can be determined from the applicant's Marine ingredients supplier to final despatch of the finished product to their immediate customer and vice versa .

| No traceability of seafood  ingredients can be demonstrated by the applicant AND finished  product is still  claimed to be IFFO  RS certified . | The Traceability Test/  Volume Reconciliation  exercise do not make sense  or demonstrate that claims  made on the finished  product could be erroneous. | Improvements could be made to traceability  documentation, or there are minor errors  that the auditor flags up. The test could cover  a more comprehensive range of the  applicant's products. | Following the  Traceability Test , complete  traceability can be demonstrated following  batch/lot numbers for the entire range of IFFO RS  compliant marine ingredients, and finished  products. If a  Volume Reconciliation  exercise is  undertaken the volume/ weight of seafood in IFFO  RS compliant finished products does not exceed the  weight of IFFO RS compliant raw materials. |

## Additional Notes

The applicant should display the findings from the traceability test in the Traceability Test Template and if appropriate a Volume Reconciliation exercise should be undertaken (see tabs in supplementary spreadsheet entitled Traceability verification test - guidance and templates ).

The Volume Reconciliation exercise is particularly important if the factory is a processor that also processes non-certified fish products that are of similar nature to the certified fish products. This to provide assurance that the volume/ weight of seafood in IFFO RS compliant finished products does not exceed the volume/ weight of IFFO RS compliant input materials.

2.5.1 This verification test shall be carried out at least once per year with a gap no greater than 12 months between tests and shall include a traceability challenge both from receipt to despatch and from despatch back to receipt

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                                                                  | Minor Non-Conformity                                                                                                                                          | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| N/A                       | The applicant has not conducted a  traceability test during the preceding  12 months. | The applicant has carried out a  test within the 12 months since  the last audit, but aspects of  the test are missing (e.g. no  trace forward / trace back). | The applicant can demonstrate that the verification test  has been carried out at least once per year, and that a  trace forward  (receipt to dispatch) and  trace backwards (dispatch to receipt) traceability test has been carried out  for the full range of IFFO RS compliant products. |

## Additional Notes

IFFO RS compliant materials from suppliers c an be traced forward to final dispatch of the finished product.

IFFO RS compliant materials in finished products must also be able to be traced back to supplier and source fishery . Note that production may use a range of different sources of IFFO RS compliant materials, as such several suppliers and source fisheries may be identified.

2.6 Any corrective actions resulting from non-conformities raised during this verification test of the product management system shall be accurately documented;

## Additional Notes

It will be responsibility of the applicant to ensure that non-conformities from the verification test will be corrected. The intent here is to enable the applicant to routinely test their product management system and make improvements if necessary. This is considered to be industry good practice.

Note that the applicant will not receive any NC from the auditor for identifying non-conformities during the verification test as long as they can demonstrate that NCs raised during the verification test have been corrected. This will encourage the applicant to be transparent.

If no non-conformities were raised by the applicant and the auditor is happy that a comprehensive verification test has been carried out, this clause and sub-clauses 2.6.1 - 2.6.2 will not be relevant.

## 2.6.1 These actions shall identify authorised responsible personnel to handle the remedial actions required

| N/A                       | Traceability and identification  records have not been kept. | Traceability and identification records  have not been kept for the 3-year  period. There are gaps in records. | All traceability and identification records have been  kept for a minimum of 3 years. |

## Additional Notes

If a minor Non-Conformity is raised due to records not being maintained for a sufficiently long duration. In these circumstances, the Minor NonConformity will remain Minor as long as records continue to be built up. This is to reflect the impossibility of creating 3 years of records in 1 year.

If no traceability and identification records have been kept, the applicant will have 3 calendar months if they are a new applicant and 1 calendar month if an existing client  to ensure that they have a procedure in place to ensure that they start building up records prior to the next audit. If this is the case, this will be the focus of the subsequent surveillance audit.

## 2.9.1 All records used to provide evidence of compliance to this IFFO RS CoC Standard shall be accurate, legible and unadulterated.

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                              | Minor Non-Conformity           | Full Compliance                                      |

## Additional Notes

Ideally there should be a written agreement in place between the applicant and certification body as part of the certification contract. Note- IFFO RS to add this requirement to the CoC application form

## SECTION 3 - Subcontractors

- 3.1 Where the applicant utilises the services of a subcontractor (carrying out contract storage, processing, packing, labelling), the subcontractor shall be audited by the applicant's certification body and shall be compliant to the requirements of the IFFO RS CoC Standard.

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Minor Non-Conformity                                                                                                          | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| N/A                       | The subcontractor has not applied to  be audited against the IFFO RS CoC  Standard. Or subcontractor facilities  have been audited though have  failed to meet the requirements of  the IFFO RS CoC Standard and any  corrective actions have yet to be | The sub-contractor has been audited  with only a few minor NCs raised and  are being addressed with an approved  action plan. | The applicant can demonstrate that subcontractor(s)  facilities have been audited as part of the applicant's  certification to the IFFO RS CoC Standard, and the  subcontractor's facilities are in compliance with the  standard. |

## Additional Notes:

Clauses in Section 3 will not be applicable if the applicant does not use subcontractors or the services of third-party transport companies.

If subcontractors are used, they will be part of the applicant's certification to this standard. Prior to the audit of the applicant's facilities the applicant should have requested any subcontractor(s) to will be part of the audit plan and will need to assessed for compliance against the IFFO RS CoC Standard. CoC audits for subcontractor facilities would be co-ordinated by the CB, this to ensure that the subcontracting facility has been audited and found to be compliant with the standard prior to the audit of the applicant's facilities.

## Certification Requirements

In the case of a trader that buys fishmeal from an IFFO RS certified factory, a) the purchased fishmeal is kept at the storage facility of the certified plant or at a storage that has IFFO RS CoC. only paperwork is required to prove that the volume reconciliation of compliant IFFO RS material is accurate b) the purchased fishmeal is kept in another storage facility that is not IFFO RS this will need to be audited to ensure that the IFFO RS compliant material is not being mixed with non IFFO RS material.

- 3.2 The applicant shall maintain an up-to-date record of the names and addresses of all approved subcontractors handling the IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients and the identity of the certified finished products.

| Critical Non-Conformity      | Major Non-Conformity                                            | Minor Non-Conformity                                                     | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No record of subcontractors. | Some Records exist though  these haven't been kept up- to-date. | All records are in place but some  elements are not filled in accurately | The applicant maintains an up-to-date record of the  names and address of all approved subcontractors  handling IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients and the  identity of the finished products. |

## Additional Notes

This is good practice; a record will help the applicant manage their subcontractors and keep on top of where IFFO RS compliant products are going.

- 3.3 If third party storage facilities are used, the applicant shall have the ability to request the IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients and the certified finished products records from subcontractor storage facilities to allow for verification at any point in time.

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity               | Minor Non-Conformity                       | Full Compliance                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| N/A                       | Subcontractor won't agree to this. | This is not formally documented  anywhere. | The applicant can provide evidence (such as  that stated in a contract/ MOU) that the  subcontractor will provide records of IFFO RS  compliant materials and certified finished  products should the applicant require. |

## Additional Notes

This would be a consideration for the applicant's product management system to take into account. So as to ensure any potential risks around using subcontractors are fully taken into account in case of a non-conforming product procedure.

- 3.4 The applicant shall have a signed agreement with all subcontractors that handles the IFFO RS compliant marine ingredients and the certified finished products:

| Critical Non-Conformity   | Major Non-Conformity                    | Minor Non-Conformity   | Full Compliance                                                                                                           |

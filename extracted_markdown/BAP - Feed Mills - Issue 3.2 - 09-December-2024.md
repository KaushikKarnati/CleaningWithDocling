## Best Aquaculture Practices Certification

The following Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) standards apply to facilities that process and manufacture  finished  feeds  for  the  culture  of  fish, crustaceans and other aquatic and terrestrial animals.

The  BAP  standards  are  achievable,  science-based and continuously improved global performance standards for the aquaculture supply chain that assure healthful foods produced through environmentally and socially  responsible  means.  They  are  designed  to assist program applicants in performing selfassessments of the environmental and social impacts, and  food  safety controls of their facilities. BAP Standards  lead  to  certification  of  compliance  after verification of the applicant's facilities by BAP approved  third-party  certification  bodies.  For  further information,  please  refer  to  the  additional  resources listed.

In common with ISO usage, these standards use the words  'shall'  to  mean  compliance  is  required  or mandatory  and  'should'  to  mean  compliance is recommended. Auditable points are 'shall' statements listed at the end of each standard.

## The Certification Process

## 1. Program Management

Best Aquaculture Practices is a division of the GSA, with offices headquartered in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA. Best Aquaculture Practices manages multiple GSA standards including the Feed Mill Standard on behalf of the GSA.

To obtain BAP certification, applicants shall be audited by an independent, BAP-approved certification body.

To apply for certification, please contact:

BAP standards demand compliance with local regulations as  the first step  toward  certification. However, not all regulations are equally rigorous. For this reason, BAP standards set out requirements for documentation and procedures that shall be in facility management plans, whether they are prescribed by local regulations or not. By so doing, they seek, where possible, to impose consistency in performance among facilities in different producing regions and to engage  the  industry  as  a  whole  in  a  process  of continuous improvement.

## 2. Self-Assessment

New applicant facilities are expected to carry out a selfassessment  against  the  Standard  to  ascertain  their preparedness for a third-party CB audit.

## 3. Third-party CB Assessments

Once a self-assessment  has  been  carried  out  by  the facility  and  it  is  satisfied  that  all  deficiencies  identified have been rectified, they can proceed to Certification. To become certified, facilities must be able to demonstrate compliance with this Standard, through an independent third-party on-site assessment by a GSA approved CB.

The chosen CB will formulate an agreement between the facility  and  the  CB  detailing  the  requirements  and commitments needed from the facility.

New facilities must be in operation for at least 3 months from  commencing  production  to  ensure  that  they  can demonstrate full compliance to the Standard during the assessment.

## 4. Assessment Frequency

and Certification Bodies where facility compliance concerns arise.

## 5. Duration of Assessments

The duration of an assessment is dependent on factors such as size of the operation/facility, number of process lines,  number  of  personnel,  and/or  quantity  of  BAP  star status product handled by the facility.  In most cases the audit  duration  is  two  full  days  depending  on  the  above stated  factors.  The  CB  must  inform  GSA/BAP  where deviation  in  audit  duration  is  foreseen.  The  CB  shall  be mindful that the assessment format is to include systems review and physical inspection of the site and production process. Time allocation during the assessment shall be such to provide sufficient and proportionate time for each activity  to  be  carried  out  in  full  and  where  appropriate, additional time given when the auditor is required to carry out further investigation.

## 6. Audit Process

All requirements in the Standard shall be addressed. As with other BAP standards, the audit against the BAP Feed Mill Standard will consist of the elements cited in Figure 1 in accordance with ISO19011.

Audits  to  the  Feed  Mill  Standard  are  conducted  at  a frequency  of  once  per  annum.  However,  additional audits, such as re-audits, short notice, or unannounced audits shall also be conducted at the discretion of GSA

At the closing meeting, the auditor shall present his/her findings and review all non-conformities that have been identified  during  the  assessment  but  shall  not  make comment on the likely outcome of the assessment.  A written  summary of the non-conformities discussed at the closing meeting shall be agreed upon and signatures  from  the  facility  representative  obtained.  A copy of the non-conformity report must be left with the facility prior to the auditor departing the facility.

The  facility  shall  provide  the  CB,  in  accordance  with GSA/BAP certification management rules, suitable and adequate objective evidence that corrective action has been  implemented  to  rectify  the  non-conformity.  This evidence  shall  also  address  root  cause  and  future prevention. The evidence will be reviewed, and the CB will respond  either  confirming  closure  of  the  nonconformity or requesting further evidence.

The facility must submit evidence to the CB in order to close out all non-conformities within 35 calendar days. Failure to close  out non-conformities  in  the  given timeframe will result in certification not being granted or continued, and facilities will be required to re-apply for a full assessment for certification.

## 8. Audit Reporting and the Certification Decision

The auditor will  provide a full  report  of  the  assessment, including the details of any non-conformities issued. The auditor will submit the report to the CB. The report shall include  brief  statements  of  objective  evidence  of  both conformity, and non-conformity.

The  report shall follow the format specified by the GSA/BAP. The report shall be issued in accordance with the GSA/BAP Report Guidelines. Within the audit report there shall be a record of the duration of the assessment (expressed as hours) and any reason for the lengthening or shortening of the duration from that which is typical.

The audit report along with the corrective actions submitted by the facility will be evaluated by a Certification Committee of the CB, who will make the final certification decision post closure  of  all  non-conformities.  The  timelines  for  audit, closure of non-conformities, technical review and certification decision are as specified in the GSA/BAP CB Requirements Document. In order to achieve certification to  the  Feed  Mill  Standard,  the  applicant  facility  must meet all of the requirements of the Standard.

BAP  standards are developed by committees of technical  experts  following  a  process  aligned  to  the FAO  Technical  Guidelines on  Aquaculture  Certification. See:

## 1. Regulatory Management

## Property Rights and Regulatory Compliance

Feed mills shall comply with local and national laws and environmental regulations, including those related to product exportation, if applicable, and provide current documentation  that  demonstrates  legal  rights  for  land use,  water use, construction, operation and waste disposal.

## Reasons for Standard

Certified feed  mills  shall comply  with  applicable business-related laws and environmental regulations dealing with, for example, waste disposal,  effluents,  and  pest  control. Facilities shall also  meet established standards for product  safety, complying with local and national regulations and the requirements of export markets.

These  regulations  are  needed  to  assure  that  feed mills  provide  pertinent  information  to  governments and pay fees to support relevant programs.

## Implementation

Regulations  regarding  the  operation  and  resource use of feed mills vary significantly from place to place. Among other requirements, such laws can call for:

- • business licenses
- • land deeds, leases or concession agreements
- • land use taxes
- • construction permits
- • water use permits
- • effluent permits
- • landfill operation permits
- • clearances to use medicated ingredients
- • air quality assessments
- • environmental impact assessments
- • strategic environmental assessments
- • feed safety protocols

BAP  auditors  cannot  know  all  laws  that  apply  to feed  manufacturing in all nations. Participating feed mills have the  responsibility  to obtain  all necessary  documentation  for  siting,  constructing and operating their facilities.

Assistance in determining these necessary permits and  licenses  can  be  sought  from  a  variety  of governmental agencies dealing with business and the  environment.  BAP  auditors shall also become familiar with the legal requirements within the areas they service.

During the BAP site inspection, the representative of the feed mill shall present all necessary documents to the auditor. All  documents shall be current, and feed mills shall be in compliance with the requirements stipulated by the documents. In cases where governmental agencies have waived one or more permits, proof of these waivers shall be available.

## Standards

- 1.1: The facility shall have current, valid documents to prove legal land and water use.
- 1.2: The facility shall have current, valid documents to prove all necessary business and operating licenses have been acquired.
- 1.3: The facility shall have current, valid documents to prove compliance with applicable regulations for construction and operation.
- 1.4: The facility shall have current, valid documents to prove that it is aware of, keeps up-to-date, and complies with, all relevant legislation of both the country they produce feed in, the countries they export to, and source countries if applicable. This includes all feed safety regulations.

## 2. Food Safety

## HACCP Process Controls, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)

Feed  mills  shall  have  current,  systematic,  and  documented  process  controls  combined  with  good manufacturing practices that minimize or eliminate food safety hazards. Food safety hazards shall be identified,  and  corresponding  risks  managed  effectively  through  a  Hazard  Analysis  &amp;  Critical  Control Points (HACCP)-based or equivalent system.

## Reasons for Standard

There are potential risks to human health associated with the contamination of aquafeeds by chemical or  biological agents. The ultimate safety of aquaculture  products  cannot  be  guaranteed  unless feed producers control what is incorporated into their feeds and how the feed is produced.

Food safety issues and biosecurity concerns have highlighted the importance of continually evaluating and  improving  food  safety  programs  in  order  to enhance consumer confidence and facilitate domestic and global trade. As a result, most countries have strict safety specifications defined by health or food safety authorities for feeds consumed by aquatic species destined for human consumption.

## Management Commitment

Top  management  shall  provide  evidence  of  its commitment to the development and implementation  of  the  food  safety  management system and to continually improve its effectiveness by  a)  showing  food  safety  is  supported  by  the business objectives of the organization, b) communicating to the organization the importance of meeting stated standards, c) establishing a food safety  policy,  d)  conducting  management  reviews and e) ensuring the availability of resources.

## Implementation

The  most  effective  way  to  ensure  food  safety  is through a systematic appraisal of the hazards involved  and  the  adoption  of  appropriate  process controls.  To  this  end,  the  most  commonly  applied tool is hazard analysis, critical control points (HACCP),  for  which  principles  have  been  defined by  the Codex Alimentarius Commission. At a minimum,  the hazard analysis shall address:

- · Risks of chemical contamination of ingredients and/  or  finished  products  with dioxin/PCBs,  medicinal  substances, feed additives,  heavy  metals  (including  lead, mercury and cadmium), mycotoxins, pesticides and industrial contaminants.
- · Biological hazards arising from the use of feed  ingredients derived from certain nonprocessed and/ or processed aquaculture/fishery products, and from contamination by restricted-use  protein  or

pathogenic enteric microbes such as Salmonella or Campylobacter species, or Escherichia coli.

- · For medicated feed producers, the risk of incorrect dosing or mislabeling.

Feed mill operators shall have in place a documented HACCP plan or equivalent documented feed safety plan. This shall cover:

- · Standard operating procedures based on Good Management Practices (GMPs).
- · Detailed  accounts  of  process  controls  in terms  of  critical control points, preventive measures, monitoring and verification procedures, corrective actions and product recall procedures.
- · Feed  production  process  flow  charts that include  critical control points.
- · Organizational charts of management and employee authority structure.

A quality management plan shall also be available.

## Good Management Practices

Good  management  practices,  also  known  as  prerequisite  programs,  are  designed  to  address  issues such  as  cleanliness  and  maintenance  to  create  an environment  in  which  safe  feed  can  be  produced. They cover all  stages of the production process from procurement  through handling, processing, storage, and  eventual  distribution  of  finished  products.  The GMPs shall specifically identify:

- · The methods  for maintaining isolation between different ingredients and between ingredients and  finished products.
- · How  ingredients,  feeds  and  feed  contact surfaces are  protected  from  adulteration with chemical and physical contaminants.
- · The methods adopted for excluding animal pests using approved pest control methods by  trained personnel  or  a  licensed  pest control service, including how the plant and warehouse are baited and fumigated.
- · Routine cleaning operations and how they are monitored.
- · How  containers  and  equipment  used  for transport, storage, conveying, handling and weighing are kept clean.
- • Procedures  for  verifying  through  product

analysis  that the GMPs are controlling the hazards they are  designed to address.

- · Procedures for managing bulk and bagged ingredients on a rotational, first-in-first-out basis.
- · How processed feeds are separated from unprocessed  ingredients  and  how  misformulated,  damaged  or  returned  feed  is stored so that it cannot  contaminate other feedstuffs.
- · How  labels  are  received,  handled  and stored to  prevent mislabeling and assure the correct labels are placed on the correct feed.

## Process Controls

The  process controls focus on the production system  and the prevention of specific risks. They shall identify:

- · Management and employee authority structure depicted in organizational charts.
- · Critical control points depicted in an overall process flow chart.
- • Finished products and their presentations.
- · Preventive measures for each identified hazard at each critical control point.
- · Monitoring  procedures  for  each  identified hazard  at  each  critical  control  point  that include frequency, assignment of task, scientifically derived critical limits, monitoring method and record-keeping method.
- · Corrective actions to be implemented when a critical limit has been breached for any identified hazard.
- · Verification  procedures  for  all  monitoring, corrective actions and preventive measures that demonstrate product safety by revision of procedures through  product analysis  at  a  frequency  specified  by  the feed  producer.
- · Recall procedures in case adulterated product leaves the feed plant.

## Incoming Ingredients

All incoming  ingredients  shall  be  inspected,  and tags or labels checked for medications, trace minerals  and  other additives.  Grain  or  feedstuffs that are moldy, treated/dyed or otherwise discolored shall  not  be  used.  Brightly  colored  grain,  which usually indicates seeds treated for use as rodenticides or other pest control, can be highly toxic to  aquatic animals and humans.

The BAP standards require that feed mills consider adulteration  with these substances  is controlled through verified controls. Feed  mills shall also maintain copies of supplier certificates  that  indicate no  banned  chemicals  or  antibiotics were applied to the incoming raw materials. Feed mills shall establish internal audit plans for verification of these  data  through laboratory analysis of incoming raw materials.

Periodic  sampling  of  incoming  ingredients  shall  be carried out to ensure that specifications are respected.  Analytical testing for contaminants shall follow Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) or equivalent  nationally  approved  analytical methods. Ingredients shall meet applicable statutory standards for levels of pathogens, mycotoxins, herbicides,  pesticides  and  other  contaminants  that can give rise to human health hazards.

Minerals, supplements and other additives shall be obtained from reputable manufacturers that guarantee the concentration and purity of ingredients and  provide instructions for correct use. For veterinary drugs, only licensed therapeutic products manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing  practices  shall  be  used,  with  the manufacturer certifying the availability of or providing certificates  of analysis. All incoming ingredients shall be verified for correct labeling, purchasing specification, cargo destination, lot  number/date and regulatory compliance, as appropriate, especially for medicated feeds.

## Production

Pathogen control procedures, such as pasteurization to  eliminate Salmonella enterica , Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spiralis, or the addition of an organic acid to inhibit mold growth, shall be used where appropriate. Results of treatments shall be monitored.  Pasteurization  can  also  be  achieved by production methods such as elevated temperatures over time.

Equipment  manufacturers  should  be  consulted  to determine what  is  required  for  pathogen  control. Work and reports to meet these standards should be developed and used.

Feed mills shall not use aquatic feed protein from the same genus as  the  species  being  farmed  to  block this possible route for the spread of disease. However,  protein  hydrolysates  verified  to  &lt;10,000 daltons are permissible.

## Finished Product

Labels and tags for finished product shall conform to legislation in the countries where the feed products are sold.

Process  controls  shall  incorporate  periodic  testing of finished product to check for chemical antibiotics  in  their  hazard  analyses  and  show  that

contamination and mislabeling. Of particular concern is the inclusion of banned antibiotics such as nitrofurans. Low  concentrations of pesticides or veterinary  residues  can  have  serious  effects,  not only  on  the  production  of  aquaculture  species,  but accumulation  of  such  residues  may  render  aquatic species hazardous to consumers if action levels are exceeded.

For  example,  in  Europe,  manufacturers  shall  make sure  permitted levels of undesirable substances mentioned in European Economic Community directives are not exceeded in feed. Other directives regulate the use of additives and veterinary medicines.

In  the  United  States,  feed  mills  that  add  drugs  to feed  are  subject  to  the  Federal  Food,  Drug  and Cosmetic  Act.  For medicated  feeds,  three  batches of each type shall be  tested  per  year  to  check concentrations against target concentrations  and ensure proper mixing and manufacture. The  subject of  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy  is  dealt  with in rule 21 CFR 589.2000. Feed mills shall comply with all relevant laws in their jurisdiction (see Section 1 of this standard) and cannot substitute compliance with BAP standards for compliance with national laws or regulations.

## Medicated Feeds

To  avoid  cross-contamination,  all  medicinal  feed additives  shall be stored separately from other feed materials, products  and  premixes.  Access  to  drug storage areas shall be limited to authorized personnel. Use of drugs and other ingredients  shall follow ingredient label directions and regulatory requirements.  Products  without  labels  shall  not  be used.

Feed  mills  shall  demonstrate  acceptable  cleaning procedures  between  batches  of  medicated  feeds. Production  runs of medicated  feeds  should  be grouped together as much  as  possible.  When sequencing is not possible, the processing  system shall  be  flushed  with  ground  maize  or  a  similar ingredient.  Flush  material  shall  be  discarded. Bulk feed delivery trucks carrying medicated feeds shall be appropriately flushed to assure that subsequent deliveries are not cross-contaminated.

Labels and tags for medicated feeds shall conform to legislation in the countries where the aquaculture feed  products are  sold.  Warnings  shall  be  clearly evident,  along  with  specific instructions, including approved  withdrawal  times,  for  the  species  being fed. Medicated feed shall be stored under conditions  specified on the pharmaceutical product label.

Medicine by the World Health Organization (WHO):

## Process Control Documentation

The facility shall maintain documents and accurate records as defined in the HACCP plan, feed safety and/or  quality  management  system  that  can  be verified as part of a third-party audit. Feed mills shall make  available  records  that  show  all  monitoring, verification and corrective actions taken.

## Recall Procedures

Recall procedures shall be planned and documented, for example,  following  the  guidelines provided by the FAO.  Shipping  and  distribution records  shall  be  maintained  to  facilitate  the  recall of  specific  production  batches/runs  to  the mill if an error occurs in processing. Refer to  the Traceability section below.

## 3. Community

## Community Relations, Worker Safety and Employee Relations

Feed mills shall strive for good community relations. They shall also comply with local and national labor laws, including those related to young and/or underage workers, to assure  worker  safety  and  adequate compensation.

Feed mills shall also promote improvements in their supply chains (See Section 3: Sustainability of Key Inputs) by  actively  favoring  ingredients  from  sources  with  clear  policies  for  social  and  labor  standards  and independently assessed sources, and shall obtain ingredients from socially certified sources as they become available .

## Reasons for Standard

boots.

Feed mills are a critical support industry for aquaculture, with expenditures on feed often the single most  important cost  of  producing  aquatic  species. Feed  mills  can  represent  considerable sources of employment  and  tax  revenue  for  local communities and national governments.

Feed mill work is potentially dangerous because of the types  of  machinery  employed  and  the  physical  bulk of  the  raw materials  and  finished  products.  Workers may not be well educated nor fully appreciate the risks inherent to feed mills, and sometimes safety instruction may not be adequate.

Feed  mills  in  developing  countries  may  operate  in weakly regulated business environments in which pay scales  maybe  low,  and  wage  or  labor  laws  may  not be consistently enforced. Feed mills need to maintain good working relationships, not only with their employees,  but  also  the  communities  in  which  they operate.

## Implementation

To  avoid  possible  conflicts  with  local  communities, representatives of feed mills shall regularly communicate with local leaders  by,  for  example, telephone, written correspondence, meetings or other means.

To  receive  BAP  certification,  facilities shall operate in compliance with this standard and all local, national, and international conventions, rules and regulations, whichever provides the highest protection to the worker. The facility  shall  have  in  place  policies  and  procedures pertaining to, but not limited to: worker health and safety and  compliance  with  requirements  regarding  wages, benefits, hours, hiring practices, minimum age, status of workers,  and  good  employee  relations  that  provide  the highest protection to the workers.

Noise  levels  in  feed  mills  can  be  high,  particularly due  to  hammermills  and  pulverizers.  Exposure  for more than eight hours a day to sound in excess of 85 dB is potentially hazardous.

Noise levels can be lowered using noise-control enclosures, absorbers, silencers and baffles, and using personal protective equipment, such as earmuffs. Where technical methods are insufficient, noise exposure  shall be reduced by use of hearing protection  and  administrative controls such as limiting the time spent in noisy environments  and  scheduling noisy  operations  outside  normal  shifts  or  at  distant locations.

Workers  shall  be  trained  in  the  first  aid  of  electrical shock,  profuse  bleeding  and  other  possible  medical emergencies.  A  plan  shall  be  available  for  obtaining prompt medical assistance for injured or ill workers.

If meals  are provided  for workers, they shall be wholesome, with food storage and preparation performed  in  a  responsible  manner.  Safe  drinking water shall always be available free of charge.

Manuals shall be available to identify standard operating  procedures. Safe working practices shall be documented for dangers such as dislodging of bridged grain  or  meal  in  bins.  Tramp  iron  and  other  metal fragments need to be removed  by  magnets  because they can  result in injury to personnel  and  cause serious damage to equipment.

Workers  shall  be  given  adequate  initial  training,  as well as regular refresher training, on safety in all areas of feed mill operation  and  on  the  application  of standard operating procedures. Appropriate protective gear shall  be  provided  for  workers according to task, including  for  example,  items  such  as  overalls, eye protectors,  ear  protectors,  dust  masks,  gloves  and

Routine maintenance has an important bearing on the safety  of  employees.  Worn  chain  and  belt  drives,  for example,  can  become  dangerous,  so  maintenance procedures are needed to keep workers safe. Uncovered  belts  or  chains  are  prohibited  with  the provision of proper driveshafts and/or drive belt safety guards.

Feed mill operators shall appoint an employee safety committee to review work practices and work conditions  and  hold  regular  safety  meetings  where employees  can  draw  attention  to  safety  problems  in need  of  correction.  A  log  or  journal  shall  be  kept

recording  accidents  and  issues  presented  at  safety meetings.

During  facility  inspection,  the  auditor  will  determine whether  conditions  comply  with  labor  laws,  including discrimination,  and  safety  requirements.

## 4. Environment

Sustainability of key inputs: Fishmeal, Fish Oil, Soy and Palm Oil

Feed  mills  shall  actively  favor  marine  ingredients  from  responsibly  managed  and  independently  assessed sources and shall obtain terrestrial ingredients, notably soy and palm oil, from certified sources as they become available.  Feed  mills  shall  facilitate  the  efficient  utilization  of  marine  ingredients  by  providing  farmers  with reliable estimates of inclusion rates of fishmeal and fish oil in compound diets.

## Reasons for Standard

Most  feeds  manufactured  for  use  in  aquaculture contain  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  as  protein  and  lipid sources. Like all renewable resources, fishmeal  and fish  oil  can be vulnerable to over-exploitation if they are not responsibly managed and there are limits to the amounts the world's  fisheries  can  sustainably supply.  As  the  aquafeed  industry  consumes  most  of the world's fishmeal and fish oil, it can exert a positive influence on sustainable supply chains.

fisheries improvement projects. This standard focuses attention on meals and oils derived from wild or farmed  aquatic  sources  including  fish, mollusks, crustaceans and algae.  Where the words 'fishmeal' and  'fish  oil'  are  used,  they  refer  to  the broader category of meals and oils from aquatic organisms.

The BAP program therefore supports the use of feed ingredients derived from terrestrial sources, as well as  fishmeal  and fish oil produced from by-products or from aquatic species that are invasive or cultivated. Ingredients  of  wild fishery  origin  that  are  not  byproducts shall come from certified  sources  or  from

Also, in this standard 'by-product' refers to materials of either  fishery or aquaculture  origin produced  as a residual of  or  incidental  to  any processing  operations  except  sorting.  'By-product' does not include 'bycatch,' which is defined as fish and other marine life that are incidentally caught while fishing for a target species. 'Reduction fisheries' are fisheries that turn their catch into fishmeal and fish oil by a process called 'wet reduction'.

To  promote  sustainable  agriculture,  this  standard

also includes provisions for responsibly sourcing soy ingredients and palm oil.

## Implementation

Aquafeed producers have an important role to play in adopting  sustainable  sourcing  policies,  formulating and manufacturing  nutritionally  balanced  diets  that increase feed efficiency, and  providing  reliable information to their customers.

Important  substitutes  for proteins and  oils from reduction fisheries  include  meals  and  oils  from plants, rendered animal  proteins  including material from  aquaculture  origins, and fish-processing byproducts from sustainable or non-threatened fisheries.

The evaluation of the sustainability status of reduction  fisheries  and  terrestrial  ingredients  is evolving, and certification programs are developing accordingly. This standard requires development of a plan to avoid unsustainable sources and transition to certified sources  as  they  become available.

Facilities shall create and  implement clear Plans of Action  that  define:  policies for the  responsible sourcing  of  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  from  reduction fisheries and material derived from fish-processing by-products from capture fisheries or from aquaculture or; goals for soy inputs such that 50% come from certified  sources  by  2022,  and;  ensure 100% certified palm oil by 2022. Additionally, facilities shall have policies to reduce any inputs of fishmeal and oil from uncertified sources to ensure they attain at least 75% fishmeal and oil from certified sources or fishery improvement projects (FIPs) by June 2025. Note that for salmon feed mills there is no delay till June 2025 for this 75% requirement to apply.

## The Plans of Action shall address how to

- · Exclude  use  of  fishmeal  or  fish  oil  sourced from illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) fisheries, or by-products from  such fisheries. The FAO International Plan of Action on IUU Fishing provides a reference tool to determine  which  fisheries  currently  operate under an IUU status (https://www.fao.org/iuufishing/international-framework/ipoa-iuu/en/).
- · Exclude fishmeal or fish oil sourced from fish or fish by-products from fisheries designated by the International Council for the Exploration  of  the  Sea  (ICES),  Food  and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the  United Nations, National Marine Fisheries Service of the  United  States,  International  Union  for Conservation of Nature or Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources as 'subject to overfishing,' 'overfished,' 'harvested unsustainably,' 'fishery  closed,'  'stock  overexploited,'  'no

fishing recommended,' 'stock critical,' 'endangered' or 'critically endangered.'

- · Exclude  any  ingredients  containing  protein from  members  of  the  same  genus  as  the species  for which the feed is  intended  [but protein hydrolysates (routinely tested to verify &lt;10,000 daltons) are permissible].

Aquafeed producers shall actively favor marine oils and proteins derived from fisheries that are classified  by  reputable international  third  parties such as the FAO and ICES as sustainably  fished, fully fished, or underexploited. One example  of an appropriate tool for developing a responsible sourcing  plan is the FishSource data bank created by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (http://www.fishsource.org).

For fishmeal and fish oil derived from either reduction fisheries  or  from  processing  by-products,  at  least 50% (rising to 75% by June 2025) (calculation based on  mass  balance) shall come from sources that are certified  to GSSI-recognized standards, MarinTrust or derived from farmed or invasive species. Byproducts may also include material sourced from nonthreatened and  non-IUU  fisheries. Alternatively, where  GSSI-recognized  or  MarinTrust-certified fishmeal and fish oil are not produced nationally, the above minimum percentage can comprise material  from  active  fishery  improver  programs (FIPs) as verified by: MarinTrust (https://www.marintrust.com/improver-programme-accepted-fips),

## FishSource

(https://www.fishsource.org),

FisheryProgress.org

(https://www.fisheryprogress.org), or the In-Transition to MSC  (ITM) Program (https://www.msc.org/forbusiness/fisheries/fips/in-transition-to-msc).  For  feed mills located in countries where neither GSSIrecognized  certified  nor  qualified  FIP  materials  are produced  nationally  (to be  verified at audit), the timelines for compliance with the minimum percentages  otherwise  applicable  to  feed  mills  is suspended until July 1, 2027.  In such cases facilities are required to show evidence of active engagement in  FIPs,  and  declining  utilization  of  fish  meal  and  oil from uncertified and non-FIP sources over time on a year-over-year basis.  FIPs should incorporate social components that prioritize the  prevention of bonded or  trafficked  labor  and  aquafeed  producers  should become supporting stakeholders in new or existing FIPs that are relevant to their supply chains. The 75% target will  be periodically reassessed with the ultimate goal  that  all  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  are  derived  from certified sources.

The  primary  approved  standard  for  demonstrating compliance is the MSC Fisheries Standard  (ISEAL and GSSI compliant), provided it is combined with MSC Chain of Custody compliance for the producing factory. Other GSSI-recognized

certification programs are also approved (https://www.ourgssi.org/gssi-recognizedcertifcation/). The secondary approved standard is MarinTrust (ISEAL and ISO 17065 compliant), whose certification process covers responsible fishery management, Chain of Custody and good manufacturing practices for the fishmeal factory.

FIP  traceability  can  be  demonstrated  through  two mechanisms:

Demonstration  of  a  Chain  of  Custody  certificate corresponding to all FIP products accounting towards the minimum percentage, OR

Demonstration of a Supplier Approval Program which includes  a  list of all approved  suppliers  of  FIP material and service providers. This list shall be kept up-to-date  and  reviewed,  at  a  minimum,  annually. The Program should include criteria for the approval of all FIP suppliers.

- -The  list  should  include  all  current  approved suppliers of FIP material, with corresponding FIP  information,  even  if  they  are  only  used intermittently  or  seasonally.  The  list  should also  include  any  outsourced  suppliers  from which there is FIP product remaining in inventory or in the stream of commerce.
- -Examples of criteria for approving FIP suppliers:
- o Suppliers must have traceability systems in  place  to  allow  trace-backs  to  vessel, trader, or wholesaler for each FIP.
- o Corresponding FIP ID number and vessel list.
- o Details  of  segregation  procedure  from non-FIP landings, when applicable.
- o Visual assessment (packaging materials).
- o Risk assessment - especially for species with potential toxicity or allergen issues, histamine, molluscan shellfish, chemical contamination, etc."

Feed  mills shall adopt preferential sourcing of responsibly  produced  soymeal  and  soy  derivatives such that a minimum of 50% (calculation based on mass-balance) are derived from certified sources by June 2022. Acceptable programs include ProTerra, RTRS  (Round  Table  for  Responsible  Soy),  SSAP (Soybean Sustainability Assurance Protocol), organic, and standards compliant with the European Feed Manufacturers' Federation (FEFAC) Guidelines (www.standardsmap.org/fefac), all of which prohibit illegal deforestation.

For all soy inputs, whether certified or not, feed mills shall  set  clear  goals  for:  traceability  to  country  of origin; verification of chains of custody; exclusion of material derived from illegal deforestation, and; exclusion of material derived from ecologically sensitive areas.

Feed  mills  shall  indicate  on  packaging,  shipping documents,  invoices,  or  in  written  declarations  for all  feeds  the  inclusion rates  of  fishmeal and fish oil derived from reduction fisheries. These data shall be expressed  as percentages averaged  for relevant production run(s). They will allow farmers to calculate efficiency ratios such as FIFO (Fish In: Fish Out), a measure  that  combines  meal  and  oil  inputs,  or FFDR  (Feed  Fish  Dependency  Ratio)  which  is calculated either on the meal or the oil inputs.

The percentages reported for calculation of FIFO's or FFDR's  shall  include  any  meal  or  oil  derived  from whole, wild-caught fish, squid, krill, mollusks or any other  wild  aquatic  animals.  However,  they  shall exclude meal or oil derived from farmed or invasive species or processing by-products such as trimmings, offal and  their derivatives such as squid liver powder and shrimp head meal.

To  calculate  ratios  for  FIFO  or  FFDR,  farmers  also require the average  processing  yields  from  the  wet reduction of whole, industrial fish. For general use, these  yields  have  been  determined  as  22.5% for fishmeal and 5% for fish oil, but feed mills should supply farmers with more precise estimates if these default values are not valid in specific cases.

To protect proprietary information, feed mills are not required  to  provide  physical  or  digital  copies  of documents such as feed formulas. Auditors recognize  that  such  information  is  confidential  and will not make copies or share confidential information with third parties.

## 5. Environment

## Storage and Disposal of Supplies

Fuel,  lubricants,  feed  mill  chemicals  and  potentially  toxic or dangerous compounds shall be properly labeled and stored, used and disposed of in a safe and responsible manner.

## Reasons for Standard

Feed mills routinely use a variety of chemicals and toxic substances that can cause damage to products,  employees  or the environment. Such chemicals include insecticides, rodenticides, fumigants, organic acids and other fungicides.

labeled  and  sent  to  a  hazardous  waste  disposal site. Hazardous chemicals shall be stored in secure, well-ventilated,  water-tight  buildings.  The buildings'  concrete  floors  should slope to a center basin  for  containing  spills.  Warning  signs  shall  be posted.

If  not used at safe levels, chemicals are a potential hazard to both the health of workers and the safety of feed mills'  products.  Fuel  and  oil  spills,  and improper use of pesticides  and other chemicals can result in water pollution and cause toxicity to aquatic organisms and wildlife.

## Implementation

Fuel, lubricants and chemicals shall be labeled and stored in  a manner to prevent fires, explosions and spills. Used lubricants  and  unwanted  or  out-of-date chemicals  shall be  disposed  of  in  a  responsible manner.

Secondary containment shall be provided for individual or multiple fuel storage tanks. The containment volume shall be equivalent to the total stored volume plus 10%. 'Flammable Material' and 'No Smoking' warning signs shall be installed at fuel storage sites.

- Oil leaks and spills from equipment shall be prevented through good maintenance. Used oil and other  chemicals shall be removed and disposed of properly. Out-dated chemicals and wastes collected after  spills  shall  be properly  confined,

Although  feed  mills  generally  do  not  store  large quantities of hazardous materials, procedures shall be  developed  for  managing  spills  or  leaks  of  oil, fuel,  gases,  chemicals  and  other products. The equipment  and  supplies  needed  for managing and cleaning  up  these  spills  shall  be  readily  available. Workers shall be trained to properly use the equipment and handle the contained waste.

## 6.  Environment

## Waste Management and Resource Use

Feed mill  by-products,  garbage,  paper  and  plastic refuse shall be disposed of in a sanitary, responsible and biosecure manner. Data on direct energy and water use shall be recorded.

## Reasons for Standard

Feed mills generate waste that can cause pollution, odors  and  health  hazards  when  not  disposed  of properly.  Human  food scraps, out-of-date feed  and other organic waste can attract scavengers. Runoff from refuse piles can cause pollution and contaminate ground water.

dumped  on  vacant  land.  It  shall  be  dealt  with according to local law by  composting, placing in a landfill or burning after excluding plastics. Composting  shall  be  done  by  a  procedure  that does not create odor problems or attract wild animals.

Empty  plastic  bags  and  other  containers  do  not decompose quickly. They can be a hazard to animals that become entangled in them.

Feed mills can improve their economic and environmental sustainability by making efficient use of energy  and  raw  materials.  By  adopting  new technology and sharing best practices they can make significant savings in direct fuel, electricity and water consumption.

## Implementation

Unwanted  or  expired ingredients and  unwanted finished product generally present the greatest challenges in waste disposal, so a rigorous program for  their  removal  shall  be  in  place.  Such  materials shall be kept in covered containers or storage areas, removed frequently and disposed of properly.

Waste ingredients  and  unsellable  material  shall  be isolated  and  identified and  shall  only  recovered  as feed  after  the  absence of hazardous contamination has been assured.

Waste and unsellable material containing hazardous  levels  of veterinary drugs, contaminants or other hazards shall be disposed of in an appropriate and, where applicable, statutory manner and not used as feed.

Paper  and  plastic  shall  be  recycled  if  possible. Collection  of  wastes  for  recycling  requires  readily accessible waste containers  that  are  serviced  at regular intervals.

## Life Cycle Analysis

Feed mills shall record, and provide the auditor with, the annual direct energy consumption (fuel + electricity) and water usage of their facilities. In future versions of this standard, Life Cycle Assessment impact data relating to feed  ingredients  will  be  considered.  These  data  are collected  with  the  aim  of  increasing  efficiency  and reducing impacts over time.

## Standards

- 6.1 Expired ingredients and unwanted, undelivered finished product shall be kept in covered containers or storage areas and disposed of  frequently and properly.
- 6.2 The recirculation of feeds within the process such as sievings and dust shall be controlled to prevent residues and cross contamination.
- 6.3 Waste ingredients and unwanted, undelivered finished product shall be recovered as feed only after confirmation that hazardous  contamination is not present.
- 6.4 Waste materials that contain hazardous levels of veterinary drugs or other contaminants shall be disposed of in an appropriate manner and in compliance with regulations.
- 6.5 Garbage, including plastic and other solid waste, shall be disposed of to comply with local regulations and avoid environmental contamination and odor problems (e.g., by recycling, burning, composting or placing in a landfill).
- 6.6 The feed mill shall keep records of mean annual direct energy consumption (kWh/MT of feed) and annual water usage (m 3 /MT of feed). Note: Auditors must include this data in the audit reports.

## 7. Traceability

## Record-Keeping Requirement

To establish product traceability, specified data shall be recorded for both ingredients and finished products.

## Reasons for Standard

Product  traceability  is  a  crucial  component  of  the BAP  certified program.  It  interconnects  links  in  the seafood  production  chain  and  allows  each  batch  of product  to  be  traced back  to  the  inputs  of  origin. Results  of  feed  quality  and  safety analyses by accredited laboratories shall also be included. Traceability  ultimately  assures  the  purchaser  that  all steps  in the production process were in compliance with environmental, social and food safety standards.

## Implementation

Feed mills shall utilize traceability systems that allow accurate  and  timely  tracing  of  all  feed  ingredients used in feeds  and all  finished  products.  Traceability procedures and systems must ensure the identification of all ingredients and finished feeds. Complete production records of batches and final feed products and packaging shall be maintained, as well as records of feed destination.

To  establish  traceability  for  incoming  ingredients,  all necessary  information must  be  recorded  for every batch/lot  at  receipt.  This data includes ingredient types, sources and lot numbers.  (See  sample Ingredient Traceability Form, Appendix A.)

Particular attention shall be given to record keeping that relates  to  animal  health  products  and premixes  used  in medicated feeds. An inventory of drugs and premixes is  required with a check on the quantity  of drugs  used  against the quantity of medicated  feeds  produced.  The  information  must be recorded for each shipment  of medicated ingredients received. (See sample Medicated Ingredient Traceability Form, Appendix B.)

For  feed  output,  documentation  shall  enable  the history of each batch, blend or run of product to be determined. The  information  must  be  recorded  for each shipment of finished feed. (See sample Product Traceability Form, Appendix C.)

To control the potential spread of specific pathogens  from  raw  materials  of  animal  or  plant origin, it may be necessary to specify for any given ingredient the country and species of origin and any treatment process used prior to purchase. Care shall be  taken  to  preserve  the  identity  of  such  material after procurement to facilitate subsequent tracking.

Records shall be retained for at least 3 years after the  date of delivery.

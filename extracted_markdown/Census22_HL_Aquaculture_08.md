Five states accounted for 55% of aquaculture sales and 49% of aquaculture farms. Food fish and mollusks were the largest product categories for sales, with catfish and oysters the top species in sales. Groundwater was the top water source, used by more farms than any other source.

## Aquaculture Sales by State, 2023

## Number and Location

Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms by providing inputs such as seed, stock, feed and/or protection from predators to add weight or change the form of aquatic animals.

Sales increased in all aquaculture product categories between 2018 and 2023. Food fish, which includes fish raised primarily for food as well as eggs from those fish, accounted for 43% of aquaculture sales in 2023. Sales of food fish totaled $819.6 million, up 14% from 2018.

Sales of mollusks, the second-largest product category, totaled $575.5 million, up 30% from 2018, and accounted for 30% of aquaculture sales. Crustacean sales totaled $175.7 million, up 75% from 2018. Ornamental fish sales increased 77% between 2018 and 2023.

Mississippi ($276,950,000) and Washington ($276,890,000) lead the nation in aquaculture sales. The 11 states with sales of $50 million or more accounted for over four-fifths of total U.S. aquaculture sales. The top five states accounted for more than half of all aquaculture sales. The same five states accounted for 49% of aquaculture farms.

## About the Census of Aquaculture

## Distributed Aquaculture

The 2023 Census of Aquaculture was a follow-on to the 2022 Census of Agriculture that collected detailed information related to production methods, surface water acres and sources, production, sales, point of first sale, and distributed aquaculture. To learn more about the 2023 Census of Aquaculture, the 2022 Census of Agriculture, and how to access census data, go to:

www.agcensus.usda.gov

In addition to aquaculture products produced and sold, some are distributed for conservation, recreation, enhancement, or restoration purposes.

In 2023, for example, 380 farms distributed 134.7 million trout of various sizes, with a live weight of 33 million pounds.

There were 4,052 farms that either sold aquaculture products or distributed them for conservation, recreation, enhancement, or restoration purposes.

## Water Sources

Farms producing aquaculture had 391,851 freshwater acres and 149,310 saltwater acres in 2023. They utilized four sources of water. Because some farms utilized more than one source, the sum of the individual sources exceeds the total number of farms.

|                        | no. of farms   |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Groundwater            | 1,915          |
| On-farm surface water  | 1,338          |
| Off-farm surface water | 276            |
| Saltwater              | 1,282          |

Miscellaneous products include algae, alligators, caviar, eels, frogs, snails, tadpoles, turtles, and other items.

## Characteristics of the fishery

The  UoA  needs  an  introductory  overview  (3-4  pages)  to  the  fishery  that  provides  context  to  the assessment. This should be completed by the assessor based on a checklist of input from the applicant and must include referencing documents used (electronic or other):

- 1. Area of operation of the UoA and jurisdiction under which it falls
- 2. History of the fishery and its past management
- 3. Data availability
- 4. Catch and fleet profiles
- 5. Fishing areas and seasons
- 6. Gears and operation of the fishery
- 7. Supply chain for fishmeal/oil
- 8. Objectives for the fishery (referring to any or all of the following if relevant):
- a. Resources
- b. Environmental
- c. Biodiversity and ecosystem
- d. Social
- e. Economic
- 9. Current status of the fishery resources, ETPs, habitats and the ecosystem
- 10. Current management arrangements and measures, including details of those individuals or groups granted rights of access to the fishery and particulars of the nature of those rights
- 11. Arrangements and responsibilities for monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) and enforcement
- 12. Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation of management performance, including reporting requirements

## Section 1 -Management/governance framework

This section considers the legislation, policy and planning (M1); management frameworks (M2); and monitoring, control and surveillance mechanisms (M3) in place in the fishery. The Fishery Action Plan (FAP) should include improvements which work towards meeting all of the requirements in this section.

## Section 2 -Fishery risk ratings: Catch, ETPs, habitats and ecosystem Section 2a: Catch

The first of the four Fishery Risk Ratings relates to the species caught in the fishery and is named  catch . ' ' This  represents  the  risk  posed  by  the  fishery  to  the  populations  of  the  stocks  it  exploits,  including discards, and particularly the risk of overfishing. Mitigation measures involve understanding the effects of the fishery on the fished species, determining appropriate levels of catch, restricting the total fishing effort, and others. The most effective way to reduce the risk posed by the fishery is to reduce total effort and/or fishing mortality, and this is reflected in the potential mitigation scores.

The catch of the multi-species fishery is divided into three parts:

Part A: Total aggregate catch -based on a target reference point (TRP) e.g. multi-species maximum sustainable yield (MMSY).

Part  B:  High-risk  species/species  groups -based  on  a  limit  reference  point  (LRP)  e.g.  Point  of recruitment impairment (PRI). Note: These species or groups of species do not include ETPs that are assessed separately below.

Part C: The reduction component of the catch -based ensuring that the catch of this component is restored to or maintained at a safe biological level and indices of juvenile catches. This component is often called  low value/trash fish  and is the source of the material used to manufacture fish meal/oil. ' '

## Part C: Reduction component of the catch

Part C of the catch criteria, looks at the component of the UoA fishery that supplies raw material that is reduced to fish meal/oil.

Mitigating measures include ensuring that the catch of the component is sustainable when the total UoA is fished to a defined TRP, and minimizing the catch of juvenile fish of higher-value species.

## Section 2b: Endangered, threatened and protected species groups

The second of the four Fishery Risk Ratings relates to the impacts of the fishery on ETP species.

ETPs, as defined by MarinTrust are Endangered, Threatened and Protected (ETP) species, are defined for the purposes of the MarinTrust assessment as those which either:

- · are categorised by the IUCN as Endangered or Critically Endangered; or
- · appear in the CITES appendices.

Species listed  in  national  (state/province/local)  legislation  as  being  depleted,  or  at  increased  risk  of extinction and usually subject to conservation measures, are also considered as ETPs.

Mitigation measures include monitoring and understanding the effects of the fishery on ETP species, minimising interactions, and mitigating other potential impacts.

## Section 2c: Habitats

The third of the four Fishery Risk Ratings relates to the impacts of the fishery on critical habitats.

A  critical  habitat  is  one  that  is  essential  to  maintaining  the  integrity  of  an  ecosystem,  species  or assemblages of species. For a species, it is the habitat that is important for the spawning and survival of juvenile fish, which if degraded, results in a decline the abundance of fish (in a tropical system these are usually mangroves, seagrasses and coral reefs).

Mitigation measures include monitoring and understanding the effects of the fishery on critical habitats, protecting critical habitats, and mitigating other potential impacts.

## Socio-economic criteria

In addition to the areas examined above, applicants to full MarinTrust approval must commit to ensuring that vessels operating in the fishery adhere to internationally recognised guidance on human rights. They must also commit to ensuring there is no use of enforced or unpaid labour in the fleet(s) operating upon the resource.

## Improver Programme notes

In the current version of the MarinTrust RS fishery assessment, the social component is limited to a commitment from applicants. The extent to which this commitment is 'tested' is limited. However, applicants  to  the  Improver  Programme  should  be  aware  that  this  section  will  be  under  continuing development over the coming years, and additional social requirements are likely to be added before the end of any FIP process.

The  overall  goal  of  fisheries  management  is  to  maximise  socio-economic  benefits  while  minimising impacts on the fishery resources and the integrity, structure and functioning of the ecosystem. Because of  this,  a  set  of  economic criteria  is  also  being  considered  so that  the  costs  (impacts  on  the  fishery resources and ecosystem) can be balanced with socio-economic benefits.

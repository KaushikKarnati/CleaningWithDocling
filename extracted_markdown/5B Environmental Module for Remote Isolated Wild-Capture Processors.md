Seafood Processing Standard -- Environmental Module for Remote Isolated Wild-Capture Processors

Issue Number 1.0

Group Program Integrity

Status Approved

## A Introduction

Environmental responsibility is an essential pillar of the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) Seafood Processing Standard. Facilities located in isolated and remote locations that treat their own effluents and discharge into a natural water body shall be audited against the clauses in this module. This module shall be audited in combination with the Core Seafood Processing Standard 6.0.

## B  Scope

This module applies to effluent criteria for seafood processing facilities in remote coastal marine locations that process wild caught species only. For the purpose of this m odule, 'Remote' is defined as a processing facility located more than 30 minutes travel by land or is only accessible by sea or air from a metropolitan area with a population of 10,000 or greater.

## C Clause Requirements

## C1 Exemptions

The auditor shall complete this section (C1) only if the facility is claiming an exemption for either no effluent discharge to a natural water body or if all effluent is discharged to a municipality.  If the facility does not qualify for an exemption, this section is to be left blank and the auditor should go directly to section C2.

RWE1

Exemption for No Discharge: The  facility qualifies for an  exemption because they do not discharge  to  a  natural  water  body  and  meet  local  or  national  government  permits  and regulations.

Examples of natural water bodies include coastal waters, bays, estuaries, etc. Examples of no discharge: effluents used for irrigation or other purpose s preventing discharge to naturally occurring water bodies. Auditor is to verify through records and site inspection. If verified, this module is complete.

RWE2 The facility qualifies for an  exemption because they  discharge  to  a  municipality  or  private  treatment  plant.  Auditor  to  verify  through  site

Exemption for Discharge to Municipality: inspection and records.

RWE2.1 Plants shall not exceed local or national government permitted load levels when discharging effluents to a municipal or industrial treatment facility.

## C2 Onsite Effluent Management

- RWE3 During a period of active facility operation and discharge, records of effluent water quality

concentrations entering natural bodies of water shall comply with government regulations.

- RWE4 or ground prior to discharge. Screened

Effluents shall be screened, captured, treated, filtered, effluents shall meet the following criteria:

- RWE4.1a All solids collected from the screening of all seafood processing effluent shall be disposed of  following  documented  procedures  that  meet  local,  state,  and  national  requirements, and/or are repurposed according to documented procedures for utilization of byproducts.
- RWE4.1b Facilities  that  dispose  effluents  into  marine  environments shall  provide  documents  that describe  how  this  is  permitted  by  using  a sediment sampling, seafloor monitoring, or an equivalent  plan  which  meets  their  permit  requirements  for  local  standards  on  benthic impacts and shall comply with those standards.
- RWE4.1c Facilities disposing effluents into marine environments  shall nominate  independent individuals  or  companies  with  demonstrated  expertise  in  sediment  sampling,  seafloor monitoring, or equivalent plans and analysis to design a documented Sampling and Analysis Plan appropriate to the facility's conditions, and to conduct sediment monitoring at least once every 2 years. Results shall show that the zone of deposit meets all local and national regulatory requirements and that there is no organic build-up beyond the boundary of the allowable sediment impact zone as defined in the documented plan. If a survey shows no deposits of organic materials on the sea floor , the 2-year survey cycle is not required unless stipulated by the regulatory authority.
- RWE4.1d Facilities  disposing  effluents  into  marine  environments  shall  develop  a written  Product Reutilization Plan describing how they will improve the utilization of byproducts/waste over time. Improvement plans shall seek to improve utilization to at least 50% of all seafood byproduct by weight within 5 years of initial certification.
- RWE5 The facility shall record and provide an annual report covering the months the facility is in operation to the auditor, depicting the annual average volume of effluent discharge in cubic meters and number of days of active production over the last calendar year.
- RWE5.1 Data  -  input  a nnual  average  volume  of  effluent  discharged  in  cubic  meters/day  for  last calendar year.
- RWE5.2 Data - input the number of days the facility was in operation during the last calendar year.

## C3 Additional Water Quality Criteria for Facilities Where Limits are Not Defined by Local or National Regulations

RWE6

Facilities operating in countries where government regulations do not include water quality monitoring shall, at a minimum, meet the SPS criteria listed in Table 1.

## Table 1 . Effluent Water Quality Parameter Values Where Limits are Not Defined by Regulations

| Parameter                               | Value           | Frequency   |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| pH (standard units)                     | 6.0-9.25        | Quarterly   |
| Total suspended solids  (mg/L)          | Data collection | Quarterly   |
| Either  total phosphorus  (mg/L)        | 30 or less      | Quarterly   |
| OR  Soluble phosphorus  (mg/L)          | 7.5 or less     | Quarterly   |
| Total ammonia nitrogen  (mg/L)          | 15 or less      | Quarterly   |
| 5-day biochemical  oxygen demand (mg/L) | 350 or less     | Quarterly   |
| Oil and grease content  (mg/L)          | 25 or less      | Quarterly   |
| Dissolved oxygen (mg/L)  At outfall     | Data collection | Quarterly   |

## Mixing Zone -Water Quality Monitoring Option

Facilities without local or national regulations on water quality limits that are also unable to comply with the parameter limits listed in Table 1 may elect an alternative approach to compliance by demonstrating that the water quality (as measured by the same set of parameters) at the edge of the mixing zone meets the criteria listed in Ta ble 1.  A mixing zone for marine processing facilities under this Module is defined as a 100-meter radius from the nearest point source of effluent discharge.

The mixing zone monitoring option shall be documented in a Water Quality Monitoring Plan that includes the parameters to be tested, a description and mapping of effluent discharge outlets and defined Mixing Zone, and how the direction of water flow in the Mixing Zone shall be determined at the times of sampling based on tides and currents to determine upstream

RWE7 and downstream directions of the discharge flow.

Water quality monitoring shall be conducted at the outer limit of the Mixing Zone (100 meters from  point  source)  in  the  downstream  direction.  If  monitoring  determines  the  sample  is compliant with the parameter limits listed in Table 1, then the facility shall be considered compliant with SPS effluent water quality requirements.

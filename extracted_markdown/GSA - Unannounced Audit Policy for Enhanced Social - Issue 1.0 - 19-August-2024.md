## Unannounced Audit Policy for Enhanced Social

Issue 1.0 19-August-2024

## 1. Scope and Purpose

- 1.1 Enhanced Social audits must be conducted as an unannounced audit. These unannounced audits shall be planned and conducted by the CB.

## 2. Timing and Pre-requisites of Unannounced Audits

- 2.1 Every effort shall be made to conduct the Enhanced Social audit at the same time as the Seafood Processing Standard (SPS) audit with both audits conducted under an unannounced audit window of 60-days.  When Enhanced Social and SPS audits are conducted together, both auditors must arrive at the same time and audits will be unannounced following the timelines laid out in the Unannounced Audit Policy for SPS.
- 2.2 If the facility has already been certified to SPS, then the Enhanced Social audit will be conducted as a supplemental extension of scope audit.  The CB will plan and conduct the Enhanced Social audit in a way that upholds a 60-day unannounced audit window.
- 2.3 If there are extenuating circumstances, the CB shall contact Program Integrity (programintegrity@globalseafood.org), with CB Dept (CBDept@globalseafood.org) and Certification (certification@globalseafood.org) on copy, for guidance.
- 2.4 A preliminary  visual  walk-through shall be  conducted as soon  as the auditor arrives on site,  the opening meeting shall take place after the initial walk-through.

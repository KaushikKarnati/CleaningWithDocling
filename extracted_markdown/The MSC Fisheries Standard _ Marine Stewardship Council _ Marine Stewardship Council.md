## What is the MSC Fisheries Standard?

The MSC Fisheries Standard is used to assess if a  fi shery is well-managed and sustainable.

To become MSC certi fi ed,  fi sheries voluntarily apply to be assessed against the Standard. It ' s open to all  fi sheries that catch marine or freshwater organisms in the wild. This includes most types of  fi sh and shell fi sh.

Fisheries are assessed by an independent, third-party auditor (not the MSC) and must prove they meet all three principles of the MSC Fishery Standard:

The third-party certi fi cation bodies measure the  fi sheries' performance using 28 indicators for each of these threeprinciples.

The Standard reflects the most up-to-date understanding of internationally accepted  fi sheries science and management. It is reviewed and developed in consultation with scientists, the  fi shing industry, and conservation groups.

When a  fi shery is successfully certi fi ed to the Fisheries Standard, its certi fi ed catch can then be sold with the MSC blue fi sh label.

The MSC Fisheries Standard

Sustainable  fi sh stocks. There are enough  fi sh le ft  in the sea to reproduce so  fi shing can continue inde fi nitely. 1

Minimal environmental impact. Fishing operations must be carefully managed to maintain the structure, productivity, function, and diversity of the marine ecosystem. 2

E ff ective management. The  fi shery must comply with relevant laws and have a management system that allows it to respond quickly to changes in the status quo. 3

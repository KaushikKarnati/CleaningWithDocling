## Florida Aquaculture Plan

November 2024

<!-- image -->

Prioritized recommendations for applied research and economic development by the Aquaculture Review Council for the purposes of creating new technologies, improved farm productivity, increased farm income and employment and other economic and environmental benefits to the state of Florida.

Dear Floridians:

On behalf of the Aquaculture Review Council, it is my distinct pleasure and honor to present a  revised  and  updated Florida  Aquaculture  Plan as  required  by  the  Florida  Aquaculture Policy Act. The Plan consists of aquaculture research and development recommendations, as required  by  statute  (597.003(1)(b)  Florida  Statutes),  that  are  provided  to  guide  public investment into answering these challenges.

Florida aquaculture is an extraordinarily diverse agribusiness. Our  state's unique climate, robust infrastructure,  streamlined  regulations  and  positive  business  environment  position  Florida  to  become  the national leader in this burgeoning agriculture sector. There are approximately 1,000 certified aquaculture farms in Florida, located in every region of the state, which culture approximately 1,500 varieties of fish, plants, mollusks, crustaceans, corals and aquatic reptiles for food and non-food markets including seafood, freshwater and marine aquarium hobbyists, high fashion leather, water gardening, bait, biological control, 'seed' for national and international aquaculturists, sporting, conservation and education. Farm gate sales of Florida aquaculture products (in real dollars) as reported by the USDA totaled approximately $71.6 million in 2018, placing Florida 9 th in the nation for total overall aquaculture value in 2018.

Societal, political and economic trends have accelerated global trade, fuel and feed cost volatility, information exchange and technology sharing. These factors require unceasing innovation by Florida farmers to remain competitive.  Florida's  aquaculturists  are  constantly  adapting  to  change  by  investigating  new  species  to culture, new markets and new sustainable production systems. A more detailed report of the industry can be found online in the 2020 Florida Aquaculture Industry Overview published by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services

(www.FDACS.gov/content/download/91723/file/2020IndustryOverview-April.pdf).  While  these  are  the most comprehensive and reliable data available, we know that they vastly underestimate the economic value of our aquaculture products (as is evident from the low survey response rate), and are not reflective of the strong growth, investment and innovation in Florida aquaculture over the past decade.

We are very appreciative of the state of Florida's history of investing public funds to support applied research, extension and education to benefit aquaculture farmers, product distributors and equipment manufacturers and suppliers. Public investment is critical to our continued success and ability to respond to unexpected technical and economic change. Support from legislators is also critical to the continued success of Florida's aquaculturists. With changing global trade dynamics, business practices, regulatory complexity and political pressures, the success of Florida's aquaculture farms will require legislative champions. We hope that the Florida Aquaculture Plan can  serve  as  a  tool  to  inform  legislators  of  the  challenges,  complexities  and opportunities for innovation and growth in Florida's most diverse agricultural industry.

Sincerely,

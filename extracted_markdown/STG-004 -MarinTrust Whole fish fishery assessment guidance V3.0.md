## Introduction

## About this document

This  document provides interpretation guidance for the MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria V3.0 (effective from 1 st May 2023) (hereafter referred to at MarinTrust fisheries guidance). The MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria defines what shall be achieved for the approval of whole fish raw material against the 'MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients  Version 3.0' (the ' MarinTrust Standard').

The MarinTrust fisheries guidance is provided to help Certification Bodies (CBs) and fishery assessors interpret the MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria.

MarinTrust maintains the  guidance as a separate document.

The headings and numbering in the MarinTrust fisheries guidance, when included, match those in the MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria.

## Auditability of the fisheries guidance

The guidance contained in the MarinTrust fisheries guidance is not directly auditable.  It is important to note that the guidance contained within this document is not binding; the approval decision for the whole fish fishery rests with the Certification Body and their fishery assessment team.

## Responsible raw material sourcing

As an essential pre-requisite to the audit against the MarinTrust Standard, facilities demonstrate that they source approved raw materials (whole fish or by-products) that are:

- · Not from Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity
- · Not an endangered species
- · For whole fish, sourced from responsibly managed fisheries aligned with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries

## Aligned  with  the  FAO  Code  of  Conduct  for  Responsible Fisheries

The criteria developed and presented in this document are based on the relevant requirements in the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and on the FAO Guidelines for the Eco-labelling of Fish and Fishery Products from Marine Capture Fisheries. These guidelines are based on a set of agreedupon international instruments addressing fisheries, in particular the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement as well as other relevant sources. MarinTrust considers fisheries that meet these criteria to be responsibly managed and in alignment with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.

## Definitions

Definitions and terms are published on the MarinTrust website.

## Whole fish fishery assessment criteria

## General guidance

MarinTrust uses the term 'species'. Th is term could mean an entire species, stock or population, as appropriate to the species and the context of the fishery under assessment.

Fishery management has as many variations in approach as there are fisheries, and so this document is not intended to cover all eventualities but rather provide advice for CBs and fishery assessors under commonly encountered  scenarios. It is intended to remain under development and will be updated as additional fisheries are assessed, and additional scenarios encountered.

Note  that  the  format  of  this  document  should  not  be  used  as  a  template  for  conducting  fishery assessments; CBs and assessors should use the fishery assessment reporting template prepared by MarinTrust for this purpose.

The CB and/or fishery assessors shall provide the relevant key information to justify the pass or fail rating being awarded for each criterion. Information should always be from reliable sources, such as official government websites, internationally recognised scientific organisations, objectively verified fishery information and NGOs. Fisher information can also be used where it can be objectively verified.

' Key information  should be interpreted to mean information that is essential to properly review the ' logic that the assessor(s) have used in the rationales.

References shall be provided to show the source information is used. The reference(s) should include the author, the title of the report/document, the page number. If an online source is used, where possible  provide  include  a  hyperlink,  and  include  additional  details  that  can  be  used  to  find  the information if the hyperlink breaks.

The  assessment  process  should  take  into  account  any  fishery  assessments  that  overlap  or  are duplicated.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  consistency  in  both  the  assessment  process  and  its  outcomes, especially when the assessments are based on the same evidence base. If inconsistent outcomes are identified, the CB and/or fishery assessor should provide a clear explanation for the difference in the assessment report.

The process for completing the template for a whole fish assessment is as follows:

- 1. Complete the species categorisation process (whole fish assessment requirements  clauses 1.3-1.4) to determine which species categories are present in the fishery.
- 2. Complete the fishery assessment of Management sections M1 and M2.
- 3. If there are category A species in the fishery: Complete the assessment against  A1, A2, A3 and A4 for each category A species.
- 4. If there are category B species in the fishery: Complete the category B risk assessment for each category B species.
- 5. there are category C species in the fishery: Complete assessment against C1 for each category C species.
- 6. If there are category D species in the fishery: Complete the category D assessment for each category D species.
- 7. Complete the assessment of the Ecosystem sections E1, E2 and E3.

Note the scoring guidance is provided under whole fish assessment requirement 1.5.

## Guidance to the whole fish fishery assessment requirements

- 1.1. Species cannot be approved for use as a MarinTrust raw material if the species:
- 1.1.1. Is a marine mammal, reptile, amphibian or bird, or
- 1.1.2. Stems from fisheries that use dynamiting, poisoning and other comparable destructive fishing practices, or
- 1.1.3. Appears in CITES Appendix 1 or 2 , or 1
- 1.1.4. Is categorised as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List . 2

## Guidance

## 1.1.3 CITES

The assessor shall review if the species is listed on CITES Appendix 1 or 2 using the CITES database Species+ (speciesplus.net) and record the information in the reporting template.

Whole fish from a species listed in Appendix 1 or Appendix 2 of CITES shall immediately fail the assessment.

If the species is not on CITES Appendix 1 or Appendix 2, it is eligible for assessment.

## 1.1.4 IUCN red list category

The fishery assessor shall review if the species is listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species https://www.iucnredlist.org/ and record the IUCN category in the reporting template.

If the species is listed by IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature) under the Red List for the following categories the species shall immediately fail the assessment:

- · Extinct (E) and extinct in the wild (EW)
- · Critically endangered (CR)
- · Endangered (EN)

If the species is listed by IUCN under the Red List for the following categories, the species is eligible for assessment.

- · Vulnerable (VU)
- · Near threatened (NT)
- · Least concern (LC)
- · Data deficient (DD)

If the species was last assessed on IUCN Red List more than 5 years ago. The species is assessed under the relevant species category, and the assessor should review stock assessment and other relevant information sources, such as latest stock assessment, ICES advice or national ETP lists.

If the species is not listed on IUCN Red List it is assumed to pass this requirement.

- 1.2. No materials from illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity shall be used as MarinTrust raw material.

## Guidance

The approval of the fishery under assessment, in combination with the controls in place at a certified marine ingredients facility will together to mitigate the risk of sourcing IUU fishery raw material.

- 1.3. Total annual catch estimates shall be used to identify the species composition and to determine the relevant species category against which each species in the fishery should be assessed (clause 1.4).
- 1.3.1. Endangered, threatened, or protected species (ETP species) are considered separately (under the Ecosystem section), irrespective of their frequency of occurrence in the catch.
- 1.3.2. Species which make up less than 0.1% of catches do not need to be assessed.

## Guidance

## 1.3 Total annual catch estimates

Catch data must be used. Information can be sourced from relevant government catch statistics when available online. Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) reports and other fishery data sources can be used. Catch composition or landings details may be provided by the applicant or certificate holder.  All information sources must be referenced in the assessment report.

Discarded species should be included when known.

Given possible fluctuations in catch composition, it is recommended to use data from at least the previous 3 years (or a more extended period if data is accessible) when determining the suitable species category. Depending on data availability, a different length of time series can be used. The assessor should provide a rationale for the duration chosen.

## 1.3.2 Species make up less than 0.1% catches

All species in the catch should be identified and reported in the assessment, as fully as the available information permits. However, species that individually make up 0.1% of catch or less are not required to be assessed.

## 1.4. The species in the catch are assessed as follows:

- 1.4.1. Type 1 Species can be considered the 'target' or 'main' species in the fishery under assessment. They make up the bulk of the catch and are subjected to a detailed assessment.

1.4.1.1. Type 1 species must represent at least 95% of the total annual catch. 1.4.1.2. If a species-specific management regime is in place for a Type 1 species, it shall be assessed under Category A.

1.4.1.3. If there is no species-specific management regime in place for a Type 1 species, it shall be assessed under Category B.

<!-- image -->

- 1.4.2. Type 2 Species can be considered the 'non target' species in the fishery -under assessment. They comprise a small proportion of the annual catches and are subjected to a relatively high-level assessment.

1.4.2.1. Type 2 species may represent a maximum of 5% of the annual catch.

1.4.2.2. If a species-specific management regime is in place for a Type 2 species, it shall be assessed under Category C.

1.4.2.3. If there is no species-specific management regime in place for a Type 2 species, it shall be assessed under Category D.

## Guidance

Both  the  terms ' target  species   and ' ' bycatch   carry  multiple  definitions  and  this  can  lead  to ' confusion and misinterpretation. To avoid adding to this confusion, MarinTrust choses to apply terms 'Type 1' and 'Type 2' species to classify assessment needed, defining species categories by their prevalence in the catch, by weight.

The distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 species is made to enable the assessment to consider the impact of the fishery on all the species caught regularly, without requiring a full assessment be conducted for each. Thus Type 1 species are subjected to a more detailed assessment, while Type 2 species are considered more briefly.

The assessor should identify the relevant unit to assess, i.e. determine if it is the entire species, or a stock or population of a species, e.g. considering the species population dynamics or the management context of the fishery under assessment.

## The 95% rule

The species should then be divided into Type 1 and Type 2 species as follows:

- · Type 1 Species can be considered the 'target' or 'main' species in the fishery. They make up the bulk of annual catches and are subjected to a detailed assessment.
- · Type 2 Species can be considered the 'non target' species in the fishery. They make up a -small proportion  of  the  annual  catches  and  are  subjected  to  relatively  high-level assessment.

Type 1 species must represent at least 95% of the total annual catch.

Type 2 species may represent a maximum of 5% of the annual catch.

Species that comprise less than 0.1% of the annual catch do not need to be assessed.

## Managed or not managed

Species are further categorised by the presence or absence of an adequate management regime in place, that is specifically aimed at the individual species or stock.

## Type 1 species (Representing 95% of the catch or more)

Category A: Species-specific management regime in place.

Category B: No species-specific management regime in place.

## Type 2 species (Representing 5% of the catch or less)

Category C: Species-specific management regime in place.

Category D: No species-specific management regime in place.

In some cases, it will be immediately clear whether there is a species-specific management regime in place (for example, if there is an annual TAC). In less clear circumstances, the rule of thumb should be that if the species meets the minimum requirements of clauses A1-A4, an adequate speciesspecific management regime is in place.

Figure 1 illustrates the species categorisation.

After allocating each species to a species category (A, B C or D), the assessor shall complete the relevant species category assessment for each species.

ETP  species  are  considered  separately  (under  Ecosystem  Impacts,  E1),  irrespective  of  their frequency of occurrence in the catch.

- 1.5. For a whole fish fishery to be MarinTrust approved, all assessment criteria shall achieve a ' pass  determination. '
- 1.5.1. If a single criterion fails, the whole fish fishery shall not be approved.

1.5.1.1.

It is not expected that sub-criteria are assessed independently of the main criterion, they not given a  pass  or  fail  determination. ' ' ' '

## Guidance

## 1.5. Scoring

The assessor shall score all applicable assessment criteria (i.e. within each module and for each relevant species category) using a binary pass/fail score.

Scoring categories -all criteria shall be met for the fishery to pass each species category.

## 1.5.1.1. Sub-criteria

The sub-criteria offer a structured evidence base to demonstrate that the fishery sufficiently meets the management criteria. It is not expected that sub-criteria are assessed independently of the main criterion.

The sub-criteria are not given a pass or fail score. The intention of sub-criteria is to focus the assessor towards most relevant evidence required to determine if the fishery or species meets the whole fish assessment criteria. The assessor shall use their expert judgment to determine if the evidence collected at sub-criteria is sufficient to demonstrate that the fishery or species meets the relevant assessment criterion.

## Final assessment determination

Once the assessor has completed the assessment (i.e. all relevant clauses are assessed), the assessor shall reach a final assessment determination to either approve or not approve the fishery under assessment.

The decision to approve a whole fish fishery means that whole fish from this fishery are approved for use by a MarinTrust certified facility. If the fishery is not approved, the whole fish under assessment is not approved for use by a MarinTrust certified site (and would be treated as nonconforming raw material) and no species caught in that fishery shall be used to produce marine ingredients carrying the MarinTrust claim.

## Guidance

## Different gear types

The assessor should take into account the effect of different gear types in the assessment outcome. For example, bottom trawl gears have a much greater impact on benthic habitats than purse seine gears. Therefore, the assessor should clearly state which gear types were evaluated.

## Guidance to the whole fish fishery assessment criteria

## 1. Guidance for module 1: management requirements

This section assesses the general management regime applied to the fishery under assessment. 1.6 All management criteria must be met (pass) for a fishery to pass the Management Requirements.

- 1.6.1 The sub-criteria offer a structured evidence base to demonstrate that the fishery sufficiently meets the management criteria. It is not expected that sub-criteria are assessed independently of the main criterion.

## Guidance

Assessment applies to the entire fishery.

| M1.1   There is an organisation  responsible for managing the  fishery.                            | Are key areas of responsibility within the fishery identified?  Are the different parties involved in the management of the  fishery clearly identified and documented?   Where there is sufficient information available publicly to  conduct the MarinTrust assessment without resorting to  requests for additional information, assessors should  consider this evidence that the management process is  adequately transparent.   |

M1.2.3  The management system has a mechanism in place for the resolution of legal disputes.

<!-- image -->

Note: This criterion is assessed by determining whether or not fishing activity is restricted to those vessels which are authorised. The extent to which the total level of fishing effort applied is appropriate for the stock status is considered on a stock-by-stock basis in Category A and Category C.

- Is  there  any evidence of historical disputes in the fisheries managed by the authority and how they were managed? The most common dispute relates to access and the sharing of fishing opportunities (rights and quotas).  Whilst all legal disputes relate to management organisation(s), to categorise for assessment purposes, they include:
- · Disputes  between  different  management  systems from nations that fish on the same stock (because it is transboundary,  straddling,  migratory,  or  has  a complex stock structure).
- · Disputes between different fishery segments e.g. by gear (pelagic trawl/long-line) or scale (industrial/artisanal/offshore/inshore).
- · Disputes  between  single  fishing  entities  and  the management organisation (e.g., where sanctions are contested).

Examples of dispute resolution by the fishery management authority in other fisheries could be used as evidence, such as mechanisms in place for fishers to be represented and to appeal decisions that affect their livelihood.

If relevant,  provide  evidence  of  management  measures within any RFMOs.

The assessment should focus on the impact of disputes on the effectiveness of the management system on sustaining fishery resources.

Provide evidence that:

- · Management  systems  should have mechanisms (continual  fishery  involvement,  effective  dialogue, transparent  processes  and  decision  making)  that work to avoid disputes.
- · Whether The management system is subject to, and bound by,  the  national  legal  system  (e.g.,  national courts) which can be accessed in the event of legal disputes.

more than every 5 years) and is there an organisation responsible for the review?

External review means external to the management system, but not necessarily international.

Periodic reviews can be interpreted relative to the scale and intensity of the fishery.

Periodic review can consider components of the management system over time and include one or more of:

- · The same or other departments of the management agencies
- · Other national agencies or organisations within the country
- · Separate review or audit from a recognised national or international agency
- · External expert reviewers appointed by the management organisation(s).

Note: A2.4 evaluates the external review of the stock assessment.

## Examples of sources of evidence, information or references to support assessment of M1:

- · Websites of Management organisations
- · Fisheries legislation, policy documents, sector studies, annual reports and reports by scientists describing the fishery
- · Management plans for specific fisheries often have well defined stakeholder roles and responsibilities
- · Rules of procedure
- · Minutes of meetings of advisory, consultation groups.
- · Organisational chart and staff job descriptions

## 2. Guidance for module 2: species requirements

Each species in the catch is subject to an assessment in this section (see clauses 1.2 and 1.3).

## Category A species

- 2.1. All clauses must be met for a species to pass the Category A assessment.
- 2.1.1. If a species fails any of the Category A clauses, it should be re-assessed as a Category B species.

## Guidance

Category A species are Type 1 species (they make up more than 5% of the catch - see the 95% rule) that have a species-specific management regime in place.

These criteria are assessed separately for each category A species.

Sufficient evidence shall be provided to justify a pass or fail decision.

If a species fails to meet the category A criteria, the species is re-assessed against category B.

## A2  Stock Assessment

A2.1 A stock assessment is conducted at least once every 3 years (or every 5 years if there is substantial supporting information that this is sufficient for the longterm sustainable management of the stock), and considers all fishery removals and the biological characteristics of the species.

A2.2 The assessment provides an estimate of the status of the biological stock relative to a reference point or proxy.

A2.3 The assessment provides an indication of the volume of fishery removals which is appropriate for the current stock status.

A2.4 The assessment is subject to internal or external peer review.

fisheries are permissible).

Note  that  all advice in this section is subject to the interpretation  of  all  available  evidence.  Some  states  issue small quotas for scientific research purposes even when the advice is for fishery closure. Fisheries with quotas which have historically  been  significantly  above  advice  may  achieve  a pass rating if there is a long-term plan under implementation which  is  making  significant  reductions  in  landings  each season.  The  final  determination  is  the  decision  of  the assessment team and the guidance above is not binding.

## A4 Stock Status

A4.1 The stock is at or above the target reference point, OR IF NOT:

The stock is above the limit reference point or proxy and there is evidence that a fall below the limit reference point would result in fishery closure OR IF NOT:

The stock is estimated to be below the limit reference point or proxy, but fishery removals are prohibited.

Is the stock estimated to be above the limit reference point or  proxy?  Or  there  is  evidence  that  a  fall  below  the  limit reference point or proxy would result in the fishery closure?

if the stock is below the limit reference point and fishing is occurring  with  no  evidence  of  stock  rebuilding  within  a specified timeframe this criteria is not met

Consider  the  biology  of  the  species  and  the  scale  and intensity  of  the  fishing  and  the  management  system  and other relevant issues over which to judge fluctuations.

Proxy indicators and reference points used must be justified as reasonable indicators of stock biomass.

Recent  trends  in  fishing  mortality  rate  may  be  used  as  a means of scoring stock status. Must provide evidence that fishing mortality (F) has been low enough for long enough to ensure that the required biomass levels are now likely to be met.

## Guidance to support Category B species assessment

Category B species are assessed using a risk-based approach.

- 2.2. The  risk  matrix  in  Table  B(a)  shall  be  used  when  assessing  a  Category  B  species  when estimates of Fishing mortality (F), Biomass (B) and reference points are available.
- 2.3. The risk matrix in Table B(b) shall be used when assessing a Category B species when no reference points are available.

## Guidance

Category B species are Type 2 species (which make up more than 5% of the catch) and are not subject to a species-specific research and management regime sufficient to pass all category A criteria.

These criteria are assessed separately for each category B species.

A category B species shall be demonstrated to be a low risk to achieve a pass rating.

Sufficient evidence shall be provided to justify a pass or fail decision.

Category B species are assessed using a risk-based approach.

Category B species are 'unmanaged' and as such will generally not have a stock assessment available, and so much of the information required for the assessment may be unavailable. As an absolute minimum, a Category B species must have some indication of the long-term biomass trends, perhaps in the form of survey biomass trends or research/commercial CPUE indices, and the majority will require an indication of fishing mortality trends or indices.

Category B species without any of this information shall be awarded a Fail rating, as per Table B(b).

If resilience for a given species is not available in the FishBase database it should be calculated based on the methodology explained below.

The category B species should be assessed by utilising the available information and applying it to the method detailed in either Table B(a) or Table B(b). An explanation of the table used, the evidence applied, and the outcome should then be provided in the template.

## If there are estimates of biomass (B), fishing mortality (F), and reference points:

A category B species can have some biomass and fishing mortality data available. When sufficient information is present, the assessor shall use the risk matrix in Table B(a) to determine whether the species should be recommended for approval.

In Table B(a), proxies of reference points are acceptable. The 'long term average' for the stock biomass and fishery fishing mortality should be estimated using an approach appropriate to the stock under assessment. This will generally be the mean of all available stock data.

<!-- image -->

## If the biomass/fishing pressure risk assessment is not possible:

Initially, the resilience of each Category B species to fishing pressure should be estimated using the American Fisheries Society procedure described in Musick, J.A. (1999). This approach is used as the resilience values for many species and stocks have been estimated by FishBase and are already available online (FishBase : A Global Information System on Fishes). Details of this methodology is provided in Box 1.

Determining the resilience provides a basis for estimating the risk that fishing may pose to the long-term sustainability of the stock.

Table B(b) should be used to determine whether the species meets the category B assessment.

## Examples of sources of evidence, information or references to support assessment of Category B species:

- · FishBase -A Global Information System on Fisheries: FishBase.org
- · Management measures
- · Time series of catch and effort
- · Ecosystem descriptions
- · Life history characteristics providing indications of species productivity, vulnerability and susceptibility to capture.
- · Observer reports

## Box 1 Determining Resilience Ratings in Category B

The assessment of Category B species utilises a resilience rating system suggested by the American Fisheries Society. This approach was chosen because it is also used by FishBase, and so the resilience ratings for many thousands of species are freely available online. As described by FishBase, the following is the process is used to arrive at the resilience ratings:

'The American Fisheries Society (AFS) has suggested values for several biological parameters that allow classification of a fish population or species into categories of high, medium, low and very low resilience or productivity (Musick 1999). If no reliable estimate of rm (see below) is available, the assignment is to the lowest category for which any of the available parameters fits. For each of these categories, AFS has suggested thresholds for decline over the longer of 10 years or three generations. If an observed decline measured in biomass or numbers of mature individuals exceeds the  indicated  threshold  value,  the  population  or  species  is  considered  vulnerable  to  extinction unless explicitly shown otherwise. If one sex strongly limits the reproductive capacity of the species or population, then only the decline in the limiting sex should be considered. We decided to restrict the automatic assignment of resilience categories in the Key Facts page to values of K, tm and tmax and those records of fecundity estimates that referred to minimum number of eggs or pups per female per year, assuming that these were equivalent to average fecundity at first maturity (Musick 1999). Note that many small fishes may spawn several times per year (we exclude these for the time being) and large live bearers such as the coelacanth may have gestation periods of more than one year (we corrected fecundity estimates for those cases reported in the literature). Also, we excluded  resilience  estimates  based  on  rm  (see  below)  as  we  are  not  yet  confident  with  the reliability  of  the  current  method  for  estimating  rm.  If  users  have  independent  rm  or  fecundity estimates, they can refer to Table 1 for using this information.'

C1.2 The species is considered, in its most recent stock assessment, to have a biomass above the limit reference point (or proxy), OR removals by the fishery under assessment are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible.

## Guidance to support Category C species assessment

- 2.4. All clauses must be met for a species to pass the category C assessment.
- 2.4.1. Where a species fails this category C clause, it should be assessed as a category D species instead, except if there is evidence that the species is currently below the limit reference point.

## Guidance

Category C species are those which make up less than 5% of catch, but which are subject to a species-specific management regime. In most cases this will be because they are a commercial target in a fishery other than the one under assessment.

These criteria are assessed separately for each category C species.

Sufficient evidence shall be provided to justify a pass or fail decision.

If a species fails to meet the category C criteria, the species is re-assessed against category D.

C1.1 Fishery removals of the species in the fishery under assessment are included in the stock assessment process OR are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible .

Are  fishery  removals  of  this  species  included  in  the  stock assessment?

Stock assessments rarely specify if fishery removals are negligible.  Look  for  evidence  such  as  management  measures being implemented for stock rebuilding and that the management measures are not contradicting scientific advice.

Examples of management measures: reduction in landings and effort,  may  also  include  increased  landing  controls,  technical measures  (such  as  gear  modification  or  changes  to  minimum landing sizes) or spatial or temporal closures.

The stock should be assessed in terms of the overall outcome objectives i.e. Is there evidence that the stock status is above the point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired and will be at or above Blim?

Where historical estimates of stock size and resulting recruitment  are  available,  the  PRI  may  be  identifiable  as  the point below which reduced recruitment has been observed in the  past,  and  above  which  recruitment  appears  to  be  more related to environmental factors than to stock size.

The  assessment  requires  that  management  measures  specify the actions to be taken in the event that the status of the stock under consideration drops below levels consistent with achieving management objectives that allow for the restoration of the stock to such levels within a reasonable time frame. This requires  the  specification  in  advance  of  decision  rules  that mandate  remedial  management  actions  to  be  taken  if  target reference points are exceeded and/or limit reference points are

<!-- image -->

approached  or  exceeded  or  the  desired  directions  in  key indicators  of  stock  status  are  not  achieved.  For  example, decreasing  fishing  mortality  (or  its  proxy)  if  the  stock  size approaches its limit reference point. This is a central component of the Precautionary Approach.

Default values for the levels of the PRI and BMSY, as used in scoring the stock status are given below. They are often related to B0, the stock status that would be present in the absence of fishing.

- · In the  case  where  neither  BMSY  nor  the  PRI  are analytically determined, the following default reference points may be appropriate for measuring stock status depending on the species: BMSY=40%B0; PRI=20%B0=½BMSY.
- · In the case where either BMSY or the PRI are analytically determined, those values should be used as the reference  points  for  measuring  stock  status  unless additional precaution is sought.
- · In the case where BMSY is analytically determined to be greater than 40%B0, and there is no analytical determination  of  the  PRI,  the  default  PRI  should  be ½BMSY. This case covers the situation of low productivity stocks, where higher default PRIs may be justified.
- · In the case where BMSY is analytically determined to be lower than 40%B0 (as in some highly productive stocks), and there is no analytical determination of the PRI, the default  PRI  should  be  20%B0  unless  BMSY&lt;27%B0,  in which case the default PRI should be 75%BMSY.
- · For stocks with average productivity, where BMSY is not analytically determined but assumed to be 40%B0 and a management trigger reference point is set greater than 40%B0 for precautionary reasons, the default PRI should still  be  set  at  20%B0=½BMSY  unless  it  is  analytically determined. This covers situations where the management authority has deliberately chosen a conservative  target  reference  point,  but  where  the default PRI is still appropriate.
- · In cases where the PRI is set at 20% B0, a default value for  the  BMSY  may  be  assumed  to  be  2xPRI.  In  other cases,  for  instance  where  the  PRI  is  set  at  the  lowest historical  biomass, it  cannot be assumed that BMSY = 2xPRI. Provide justification for any reference point used as  a  proxy  of  BMSY  in  terms  of  its  consistency  with BMSY.

<!-- image -->

The default PRI values given above (½BMSY or 20%B0) apply to stocks with average productivity. Such points are generally consistent with being above the point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired, though for some short-lived stocks the actual point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired may be lower than 20%B0 and for some long-lived species it may be higher than this.

## Examples of sources of evidence, information or references to support assessment of category C species:

- · Catch composition data
- · Stock assessments
- · Management measures for any stocks shown to be depleted
- · Evidence that the fishery is not hindering the recovery of the species below the PRI, such as evidence indicating a lack of gear interaction, or evidence pointing to an unrelated cause (or fishery) limiting recovery.

## Guidance to support category D species assessment

Category D species are assessed against a risk-based approach.

- 2.5. The Productivity-Susceptibility  Analysis  (PSA)  in  Table  D(a)  shall  be  used  when  assessing category D species.
- 2.6. Table D(b) shall be used to calculate the overall PSA risk rating for the category D species.
- 2.7. Should  the  PSA  indicate  a  high  risk,  further  assessment  shall  be  completed  against  the requirements in Table D(c).

## Guidance

Category D species are Type 2 species (those which make up less than 5% of catches) and are not subject to a species-specific management regime.

In the case of multi-species fisheries (e.g. tropical trawl fisheries), category D species may make up the  majority  of  catches.  The  comparative  lack  of  scientific  information  on  the  status  of  the population of the species means that a risk-assessment style approach must be taken.

These criteria are assessed separately for each category D species. Sufficient evidence shall be provided to justify a pass or fail decision.

The process for assessing category D species involves the use of a Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) to further subdivide the species into high, medium and low risk groups.  A PSA measures, using predetermined attributes, the vulnerability of a species to the impacts from fishing.

Productivity and susceptibility attributes and scores are calculated using a PSA methodology taken

<!-- image -->

from the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) , See MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox v1.0 (date of issue 26 October 2022).

Table D1 shall be completed by the assessor as follows:

- · Use the best available information to fill in values for each productivity and susceptibility attribute.
- · Use Table D(a)to convert each Productivity attribute value and each Susceptibility attribute value into a score between 1 and 3 (this is the risk rating provided in Table D(a).
- · Calculate the average score for productivity attributes and the average for susceptibility attributes and record this in Table D1 in the reporting template. Average scores are calculated using the arithmetic mean.
- · If information cannot be found for an attribute on Fishbase.org or any other reliable source, then this value is described as unknown, and the score is not factored into the average productivity.
- · Where there is uncertainty affecting the assessor's decision when scoring the susceptibility attributes this should be noted in Table D1.
- · The assessor shall then use Table D(b) to calculate an overall PSA risk rating for the Category D species under assessment.
- o The outcome of the PSA risk rating can be either:
- ▪ The risk rating is low and the species passes the Category B assessment, or
- ▪ The risk rating is higher, and the assessor shall complete additional checks to assess the vulnerability of the Category D species to the impacts of fishing.

If the species fails to pass the risk rating in Table D(b) then the assessor shallassess if the species meets the clauses D2.1 and D2.2.

## Examples of sources of evidence, information or references to support the assessment of Category D species

- · FishBase.org
- · Management measures
- · Time series of catch and effort
- · Ecosystem descriptions
- · Life history characteristics providing indications of species productivity, vulnerability and susceptibility to capture.

## 3. Guidance for module 3: Ecosystem requirements

This section assesses the impacts that the fishery under assessment may have on key ecosystem components: ETP species, habitat and the wider ecosystem.

- 3.1. All ecosystem criteria must be met (pass) for a fishery to pass the Ecosystem Requirements.
- 3.1.1. The sub-criteria offer a structured evidence base to demonstrate that the fishery sufficiently meets the ecosystem criteria, it is not expected that sub-criteria are assessed independently of the main criterion.

## Guidance

The three sections in the Ecosystem Impacts module (E1, E2 and E3) relate to the impacts the fishery under assessment may have in other areas (on Endangered, Threatened or Protected (ETP) species, on the habitat and on the wider ecosystem).

## Endangered, Threatened and Protected (ETP) species

Endangered, Threatened and Protected (ETP) species are defined for the purposes of the MarinTrust assessment as those which either:

- · Appear in the CITES appendices, or;
- · Are categorised by the IUCN as Endangered or Critically Endangered.

Appendices I and II:

- · Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.
- · Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.
- · Appendices III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.

Sufficient evidence shall be provided to justify a pass or fail decision.

formal or informal ETP management strategy, with a focus on describing any measures which are in place to reduce the impacts of the fishery on one or more ETP species. Such measures could include:

- · Gear restrictions/regulations;
- · Spatial or seasonal restrictions;
- · Fisher training;
- · Voluntary or mandatory codes of conduct;
- · Evidence that restrictions on the total level of fishery removals take into account the needs of ETP predator species.

The assessor should provide evidence of any actions or tools in place that explicitly or indirectly contribute to achieving the objectives of legislation relating to ETP species. Examples can include:

- · Mitigation measures that minimise mortalities of a species with a specific gear type
- · Comparison with similar fisheries and species (e.g. similar gear, area of operation, interactions with same ETP species)
- · From trials or measures taken by the fishery itself.

## Examples of sources of evidence, information or references to support the assessment E1

- · ETP national and international legislation
- · ETP distribution maps
- · National species profiles
- · IUCN status
- · Records of interaction with a fishery in logbooks, scientific reports, observer data etc.
- · Independent observer reports
- · Independent expert reports (e.g. Environmental NGOs)
- · Records of any testing or inspecting of any ETP mitigating management measures (e.g. gear modifications)

E3.1.3   Collection and analysis of ecosystem information is adequate to provide a reliable indication of the impact the fishery has on marine ecosystems.

Is the information collected on marine ecosystems is sufficient to provide fishery managers with an informed and reliable view of the impacts of the fishery on ecosystems? This may include information collected independently of the fishery, e.g. by studies to determine the impact of similar fisheries on ecosystem structure and function.

This sub-criteria should primarily be assessed by considering whether the conclusions reached in E3.3.2 -whether the fishery has a significant negative impact on ecosystems -and in E3.3.3 -whether there is a strategy in place to manage impacts on ecosystems -are founded on a solid evidentiary basis. The fishery should not be awarded a pass against E3.3 if there is a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding either, and there are reasonable measures which managers could take to reduce that uncertainty but have not.

Review the conclusions reached by the management process -i.e. by managers and/or scientific organisations associated with fishery managers; however, assessors should also consider any fishery-independent information available.

The assessor is not expected to conduct their own analysis of the likely impacts of the fishery on ecosystems, and should instead review conclusions reached by experts. In the absence of any evidence that the fishery has had a significant negative impact on marine ecosystems, this criteria is met.

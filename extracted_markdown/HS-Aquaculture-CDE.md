## COMPETITIVE EVENT POLICIES &amp; PROCEDURES

## PHILOSOPHY

The National FFA Organization and Florida FFA Association are dedicated to organizing experiences that will meet the future needs of students while accomplishing the current purposes of agricultural education.

The primary goal of career and leadership development events is to develop individual college and career readiness skills through personal growth and premier leadership.

Individuals will be challenged to develop critical thinking skills, effective decision making skills, foster teamwork and promote communication while recognizing the value of ethical competition and individual achievement.

The activities in each event:

- ■ Include problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork skills, where appropriate.
- ■ Encourage appreciation for diversity by reducing barriers to participation among members.
- ■ Develop general leadership and recognize individual and team achievement.
- ■ Promote concentrated focus on future needs of members and society.

Career and Leadership Development Events should reflect instruction that currently takes place in the entire agricultural education program, including classroom instruction, laboratory instruction, instruction in leadership and supervised agricultural experience. Events are intended to be an outgrowth of instruction. Also, it is appropriate for the national organization and the state association to develop events and awards that stimulate instruction in emerging areas that reflect both current and future community, national and global workforce needs. Those events should be developed with significant input from FFA members, teachers, partners, respective industry sponsors and others involved in agricultural education. The National FFA Organization and Florida FFA Association continues to encourage accessibility and provide opportunities for achievement and recognition for students with diverse backgrounds.

Events that include team activities should be based on cooperation and teamwork while recognizing the value of competition and individual achievement. Where appropriate, team activities will be included that require two or more members from one chapter working cooperatively.

## POLICIES &amp; PROCEDURES

Violations of any of the following rules may be grounds for the event superintendent to disqualify the participants.

Florida FFA staff and event superintendents will use the published policies and procedures to organize and implement the Florida FFA Career and Leadership Development Events. Event activities may not be conducted due to lack of necessary materials, expertise or extreme impact to event budgets. Teams will receive the current event format prior to the event.

## ELIGIBILITY OF PARTICIPANTS

Each participant must be a current dues paying member in good standing with the local chapter, state FFA association, and National FFA Organization for the school year during which the event is held (or the previous year).

The participant must be enrolled in Agriculture, Food  and Natural Resources Education, and maintain a Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) program.

Note:  Certain exceptions may apply as follows.  If a student is unable to enroll in an agriculture course due to extenuating circumstance, such as program closure or scheduling problems, that student may maintain active membership status for up to one membership year by paying local, chapter and state dues and by maintaining a Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) program and active involvement with the local FFA chapter.  This period of FFA membership will be terminated at the end of that membership year if the student does not re-enroll in a systematic program of agricultural instruction.

If a student moves to a different chapter once he/she has qualified as a chapter representative in a CDE/LDE that student may be allowed to compete in the state event with the school he/ she qualified with during the qualifying year. Note: this only applies to LDEs held at State FFA Convention.

A member who is a former state winner, either individual or team, in a particular FFA CDE/LDE is not eligible to compete in that CDE/LDE area again, with the exception of teams/individuals who win on the middle school level and then compete in the same CDE/LDE on the high school level.

The student must not have previously participated in a National Career or Leadership Development Event of the same kind.

Florida FFA will only permit students in grades 9-12 to represent Florida at national Career/ Leadership Development Events, with the exception of the Creed LDE and Conduct of Chapter Meetings LDE. Creed and Conduct of Chapter Meetings will be open for students in grades 7-9

In the event that one, two, or three members of a four member team are ineligible to compete in national competition, the advisor must substitute eligible members from the chapter to compete nationally.  Members serving as substitutes will be ineligible for future competition in that contest or award program area.

Few exceptions will be made in the scheduling of events for teams participating in two events, which are held simultaneously.  Prior notice must be given to the Florida FFA Association office for such consideration.

## REGISTRATION

Pre-registration is required for all events at the sub-district, district and state level, unless

F

otherwise announced by the Florida FFA Association.  Chapters should register at www.flaffa.org. Registration will open approximately four (4) weeks prior to the event and will close approximately two (2) weeks prior to the event, as published on the official Florida FFA calendar.

Following the close of registration, a list of registered teams will be distributed electronically.  If a chapter's name does not appear on the list as a result of registration error, notification must be made to the Florida FFA Office within twenty-four (24) hours or by the published deadline.

Chapters not properly registered will not be eligible for competition.

## DISQUALIFICATION

A member or team may be disqualified from an event if:

- ■ There is any communication, verbal or non-verbal, between participants during the event. The only exception to this would be communications between team members during the team activity portion of a given event.
- ■ Any assistance is given to a team member from any source other than the event officials or assistants.
- ■ Event superintendents stop any participants for manners they deem to be hazardous to themselves or others. Such action shall deem the individuals disqualified for that section of the event.
- ■ Participants start the event and do not complete the event without notifying event officials at the time of departure. This can affect the overall team rank and position. In some events this will also disqualify the entire team.
- ■ Participants utilize personal electronic communication devices, other than those approved by the event officials, during the entire course of the event. Participants who access personal electronic communication devices without prior approval of the event officials will be disqualified.
- ■ Participant, team, advisor or coach gains access to real materials that will be utilized by the event committee during competition. Any team, participant, advisor or coach reported and provento do so will be disqualified from the event.
- ■ It is prohibited for an advisor or anyone else to register their members under another member or chapter name.  If this rule is violated, the chapter(s) involved will be disqualified from the event.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES

- 1. Advisors should properly instruct students how to participate in a CDE/LDE prior to arrival at the event (including judging card completion, contest expectations, etc.).
- 2. Contestants must provide their own pens, pencils, erasers, clip boards and other necessary items necessary for competition.
- 3. Late arrivals may be ineligible for competition.  Decisions regarding participation will be made at the discretion of the CDE/LDE superintendent.
- 4. FFA members should be in official dress, appropriate to the event, and will be scored accordingly.  (See Official Dress Scoring for details.)
- 5. All participants will be assigned to a group number and are to stay with their assigned group at all times or until told otherwise by the event superintendent or group leader.

## ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL STUDENTS

All special needs requests and appropriate documentation must be submitted at the time of registration.

## HONESTY AND INTEGRITY

Florida FFA expects students to be honest in all of their work, including work outside of the classroom related to Career Development Events (CDE) and Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) programs. By participating in a competitive event, FFA members, advisors and proctors agree to adhere to high standards of academic honesty and integrity and understand that failure to comply with this pledge may result in disciplinary action, up to and including event disqualification, loss of Quality FFA Chapter Status and termination of active FFA membership.

As an integral component of school-based agricultural education, FFA is obligated to report cases of student, teacher, chaperone or proctor dishonesty to the school district.

All FFA members and advisors have an ethical obligation to adhere to the Honor Code and are required to abide by the following Academic Honesty Policies:

I. By registering for or participating in any FFA event, FFA chapter representatives, including students and adults, agree to adhere to the following academic honesty code.  FFA chapter representatives that do not agree to this policy should not register or participate. I understand that FFA expects its students and teachers to be honest in all of their work. I agree to adhere to this commitment to academic honesty and understand that my failure to comply with this commitment may result in disciplinary action, up to and including event disqualification, loss of Quality FFA Chapter Status and termination of active FFA membership.

- II. The conduct set forth hereinafter constitutes a violation of the Academic Honesty Policies. Those adjudged to have committed such conduct shall be subject to discipline. Violations of the Honor

F

Code and Policies include but are not limited to the following:

## CHEATING

The improper taking or tendering of any information or material which shall be used to determine academic or competitive credit. Examples include but are not limited to the following:

- ■ Copying from another student's test or materials.
- ■ Allowing another student to copy from a test or materials.
- ■ Using unauthorized materials during a test, such as the textbook, notebook, formula lists or notes, including those stored in a calculator or other electronic device.
- ■ Collaborating during an event or activity with any other person by giving or receiving information without authority.
- ■ Having another individual write or plan a paper, including those bought from research paper services.

## PLAGIARISM

The attempt to represent the work of another, as it may relate to written or oral works, computerbased work, mode of creative expression, as the product of one's own thought, whether the other's work is published or unpublished, or simply the work of a fellow student or teacher.

When a student submits oral or written work that includes the words, ideas, or data of others, the source of that information must be acknowledged through complete, accurate, and specific references, and, if verbatim statements are included, through use of quotation marks as well. By placing one's name on work submitted for credit, the student certifies the originality of all work not otherwise identified by appropriate acknowledgements. A student will avoid being charged with plagiarism if there is an acknowledgement of indebtedness.  It is the FFA advisor's responsibility to monitor and have an accurate understanding of the source of the students work.

## Examples include:

- ■ Quoting another person's actual words.
- ■ Using another person's idea, opinion, or theory, even if it is completely paraphrased in one's own words.
- ■ Drawing upon facts, statistics, or other illustrative materials - unless the information is common knowledge.
- ■ Failing to accurately document information or wording obtained on the internet.
- ■ Submitting anyone else's work as one's own work.
- ■ Violating federal copyright laws, including unauthorized duplication and/or distribution of copyrighted material.
- ■ Offering, giving, receiving or soliciting of any materials, items or services of value to gain competitive advantages for yourself or another.

## BRIBERY

The offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of any materials, items or services of value to gain academic advantage for yourself or another.

## MISREPRESENTATION

Any act or omission with intent to deceive an event official for competitive advantage. Misrepresentation includes lying to an event official or misstating the facts to increase your competitive standing.

## CONSPIRACY

The planning or acting with one or more persons to commit any form of academic dishonesty to gain competitive advantage for yourself or another.

## FABRICATION

The use of invented or fabricated information, or the falsification of research or other findings with

F

the intent to deceive for competitive advantage.

## Examples include:

- ■ Citing information not taken from the source indicated.
- ■ Listing sources in a Works Cited or reference not used in the academic exercise.
- ■ Inventing data or source information for research or other academic exercise.
- ■ Submitting any academic exercise as one's own prepared totally or in part by another, including on-line sources.
- ■ Taking a test for someone else or permitting someone else to take a test for you.

## COLLUSION

The act of working with another person on an competitive undertaking for which a student is individually responsible. Unless working together on an individual practicum has been prior approved, it is not allowed. On team practicums, students must stay within the guidelines set by the event coordinator. If the event coordinator provides additional guidelines, they must be followed. Failure to do so also constitutes a violation of these Policies and Rule.

## COMPETITIVE MISCONDUCT

The intentional violation of integrity by tampering with scores or taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a test or practicum.

## Examples include:

- ■ Stealing, buying, downloading, or otherwise obtaining all or part of a test and/or test answers without authorization.
- ■ Asking or bribing any other person to obtain a test or any information about a test.
- ■ Changing, altering, or being an accessory to changing and/or altering of an exam response or a grade recorded.
- ■ Continuing to work on an examination or practicum after the specified time has elapsed.

## IMPROPER COMPUTER/CALCULATOR USE

Examples of improper computer and/or calculator use include but are not limited to:

- ■ Sharing a calculator or computer while leaving answers on display or in memory.
- ■ Submitting a duplicate printout with only the student's or chapter's name changed. This applies to all FFA events, awards and activities.

## IMPROPER ONLINE TESTING USE INCLUDE:

- ■ Having or providing unauthorized outside help when completing online assessments.
- ■ Obtaining access to confidential test materials or questions before online assessments.
- ■ Agriculture Teachers being in the room during online testing and/or certification.
- ■ Proctors must not administer tests to their family members.
- ■ Taking a test for someone else or permitting someone else to take a test for you.

NOTE:  A third-party designated proctor must administer all FFA related exams and certifications.

Third-party proctor must have received notification of and agree to these policies and may be required to submit documentation certifying the integrity of the online exam process.  A third-party proctor cannot be the agriculture teacher(s).  Examples of acceptable third-party proctors include: school administrators, computer lab coordinators, media specialists, guidance counselors, testing coordinators, teachers not affiliated with the agriculture program, other non-instructional school or school district officials.

## DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR

Each chapter representative's behavior during an FFA event or activity is expected to contribute

F

to a positive learning/teaching/competitive environment, respecting the rights of others and their opportunity to learn or participate. No chapter representative has the right to interfere with this process, including the posting of inappropriate materials on social media sites.

FFA event officials have the authority to ask a disruptive chapter representative to leave the event or activity and will report the incident as appropriate.

## ELECTRONIC DEVICES

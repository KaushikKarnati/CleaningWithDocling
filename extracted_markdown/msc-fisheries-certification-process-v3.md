## The Marine Stewardship Council

## Vision

Our vision is of the world's oceans teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations.

## Mission

Our mission is to use our ecolabel and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world's oceans by recognising and rewarding sustainable fishing practices, influencing the choices people make when buying seafood, and working with our partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis.

## General introduction

## Fisheries certification

With international consultation with stakeholders, the MSC has developed standards for sustainable fishing and seafood traceability. These standards ensure that MSC labelled seafood comes from, and can be traced back to, a sustainable fishery.

MSC standards and requirements meet global best practice guidelines for certification and labelling programs.

The MSC Fisheries Standard sets out requirements that a fishery must meet to enable it to claim that its fish come from a well-managed and sustainable source.

Throughout the world, fisheries are using good management practices to safeguard jobs, secure fish stocks for the future, and help protect the marine environment. The science-based MSC environmental standard for sustainable fishing offers fisheries a way to confirm sustainability, using a credible, independent, third-party assessment process. Certification means sustainable fisheries can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace and gives an assurance to consumers that their seafood comes from a well-managed and sustainable source.

The MSC Fisheries Standard applies to wild-capture fisheries that meet the scope requirements provided in the MSC Fisheries Standard Section 1.

The MSC Fisheries Standard comprises the following core Principles:

## Principle 1: Sustainable target fish stocks

A fishery must be conducted in a manner that does not lead to over-fishing or depletion of the exploited populations and, for those populations that are depleted, the fishery must be conducted in a manner that demonstrably leads to their recovery.

## Principle 2: Environmental impact of fishing

Fishing operations should allow for the maintenance of the structure, productivity, function, and diversity of the ecosystem on which the fishery depends. The ecosystem includes habitat and associated dependent and ecologically related species.

## Principle 3: Effective management

The fishery is subject to an effective management system that respects local, national, and international laws and standards, and incorporates institutional and operational frameworks that require use of the resource to be responsible and sustainable.

## Implementation timeframes ◙

## Effective date of the Fisheries Certification Process v3.0

Publication date: 26 October 2022

Effective date: 1 May 2023

CABs shall conduct any assessment process (initial assessment, surveillance audit, scope extension, expedited audit, or reassessment) against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 (and subsequent versions) that is announced on or after 1 May 2023 in conformity with the Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) v3.0.

Any CAB may use the FCP v3.0 as of the publication date if they are ready to do so and templates and training are ready.

## Review

The MSC welcomes comments on the FCP. Comments will be considered as part of the next review process. Reviews will take place at least every 5 years. Please submit comments to standards@msc.org.

More information about the MSC policy development process and MSC Standard Setting Procedure can be found on the MSC website (msc.org).

## Introduction to this document

The FCP v3.0 and the annexes define the process requirements for CABs to assess fisheries against the MSC Fisheries Standard.

The FCP consists of the assessment process (Sections 1-7) and process annexes (PA-PE).

## Fisheries Certification Process

The purposes of the FCP are:

- · To establish a defined process that enables all CABs to operate in a consistent and controlled manner.
- · To provide transparency to maintain credibility with stakeholders.

## The MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process

Guidance is provided in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process (GFCP) to help CABs interpret the FCP.

The headings and numbering in the GFCP, when included, match those in the FCP exactly, with numbers prefaced with the letter 'G' to indicate guidance.

The MSC recommends that CABs read the FCP in conjunction with the GFCP. Text in the FCP is not repeated in the GFCP.

Where guidance is provided that generally relates to the subject of a section, or relates to the content of a specific clause, this icon ◙ appears at the end of the section title or clause in the FCP. These icons provide hyperlinks to the related guidance section in the GFCP.

In the GFCP, this icon ▲ provides a hyperlink back to the corresponding section or clause in the FCP.

## The MSC Interpretations Log

The MSC occasionally provides additional guidance to CABs and assessment teams via interpretations that are posted on a public Interpretations Log. Interpretations are provided in response to questions about requirements in the FCP, the Fisheries Standard, and the General Certification Requirements (GCR). Interpretations help clarify the MSC's intent and provide additional information and guidance to explain how a requirement should be interpreted and applied. They are not new requirements.

The MSC recommends that CABs and assessment teams check the Interpretations Log on a regular basis and follow relevant interpretations.

## Auditability of the Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process and interpretations

The guidance in the GFCP and interpretations is not directly auditable.

## Derogations

Derogations are temporary normative measures that allow for an MSC requirement to be applied differently or disregarded. Derogations are provided in response to editorial errors, force majeure, where intent is no longer fit for purpose and threatens MSC credibility, or as a provision to test a policy change or modify the implementation timeframe when publishing a revised version of the normative document. Derogations are posted on a public log. The MSC requires CABs to follow relevant derogations.

## Annex PA: Requirements for inseparable or practicably inseparable stocks - normative

## PA1 Requirements for inseparable or practicably inseparable stocks

## PA1.1 Scope

PA1.1.1

The requirements of this annex shall apply to all inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) catch within fisheries being assessed.

## PA1.2 Default assessment tree

PA1.2.1 The Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) shall review and, if necessary, propose modifications to the default assessment tree to proceed with the assessment of IPI stock(s).

PA1.2.2 Using the tree, the CAB shall:

- a. Assess the IPI catch under the primary component of Principle 2.
- b. Separately assess the impact of all fishing activity on the IPI stock(s) considered for entry into certified Chains of Custody using the criteria specified in PA1.4.2, for the purposes of determining the eligibility of the catches of IPI stock(s) to enter further certified Chains of Custody.

## PA1.3 Conditions

PA1.3.1 If there are IPI stock(s) within the scope of certification, the CAB shall set conditions to: ◙

- a. Promote the future Principle 1 assessment of the IPI stock(s), or
- b. Promote the development of techniques to effectively separate catches of currently IPI stock(s).

## PA1.4 Entry into further Chains of Custody

- PA1.4.1 The CAB shall ensure that only defined and limited proportions of catches from IPI stock(s) enter into certified Chains of Custody.

PA1.4.1.1 The MSC ecolabel is only permitted for use on these catches for a maximum of 1 certification period.

- PA1.4.2 The CAB shall verify that the IPI stock(s) meet the following requirements, prior to being considered eligible to enter further certified Chains of Custody:
- a. The IPI stock(s) are likely to be above the PRI as defined in the MSC Fisheries Standard GSA2.2.1.1, or if below the limits, measures are in place that are expected to ensure that all fishing-related mortality does not hinder the recovery and rebuilding of IPI stock(s).
- b. If the stock status is poorly known, measures or practices are in place that are expected to keep the IPI stock(s) above the point of recruitment impairment (PRI) or to prevent all fishing activity from hindering recovery.
- c. The measures are considered likely to work, based on plausible argument. ◙

## PA1.5 Surveillance

PA1.5.1 If the UoA includes IPI stock(s), the CAB shall review and document the continuing performance against conditions in PA1.3.1 and against the requirements in PA1.4.2.

## PA1.6 Reassessment

PA1.6.1 IPI stock(s) are only eligible for the period of 1 certificate. For continued certification, the CAB shall inform clients of the following options:

- a. Certify all IPI stock(s) against Principle 1 at reassessment.
- b. Develop techniques to effectively separate catches of currently IPI stock(s) from target stock(s) so the IPI scope criteria are no longer met.
- c. Develop measures to reduce the proportion of IPI stock(s), to be able to meet the requirements for IPI stock(s) as set out in 7.5.14.2.

PA1.6.2 The CAB shall assess remaining IPI stock(s) against Principle 1 at reassessment.

End of Annex PA

## Annex PB: Harmonisation of overlapping Units of Assessment - normative

## PB1 Harmonised Units of Assessment - normative ◙

## PB1.1 Scope and assessment tree

PB1.1.1 The CAB shall use this annex where Units of Assessment (UoAs) overlap, irrespective of the assessment tree and version of the MSC Fisheries Standard.

PB1.1.1.1

Where UoAs have been assessed against different versions of the MSC Fisheries Standard, CABs shall only harmonise those Performance Indicators (PIs) that have the same intent.

PB1.1.1.2

The CAB shall use the Change Tracker Report - FS 2.01 to 3.0 to identify the PIs across different versions of the MSC Fisheries Standard that have the same intent.

The CAB shall use the latest version of this annex when different versions of the MSC

PB1.1.2 Fisheries Certification Process are used.

## PB1.2 Identifying overlapping Units of Assessment

PB1.2.1 The CAB shall use the following criteria to identify overlapping UoAs: ◙

- a. UoAs that have the same P1 stock (7.5.2.a).
- b. UoAs that operate in the same geographical area (7.5.6).
- c. UoAs that impact the same P2 scoring elements (MSC Fisheries Standard SA3.1.2).
- d. UoAs that are subject to management by the same jurisdictions (MSC Fisheries Standard SA4.1.1).

PB1.2.2 The CAB shall use Table PB1 to determine the PIs that are subject to harmonisation (noting PB1.1.1.1).

## The MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process

## Guidance to implementation timeframes ▲

The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) does not expect the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) to change between versions of the MCS Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) during any assessment or audit process.

## G4

## General requirements

<!-- image -->

## G4.2 Consultation requirements ▲

Stakeholder consultation is a critical component of the MSC fisheries assessment process, as:

- · A robust stakeholder consultation process is fundamental to conducting a high-quality assessment.
- · Stakeholder input provides important information to assessment team members and the CAB.
- · Stakeholder input contributes significantly to the credibility and outcome of the assessment process.

The MSC's intent for stakeholder consultation throughout the FCP is to ensure:

- · Early identification of relevant stakeholders, each of whom are given adequate opportunity to provide their views during relevant stages of the assessment.
- · Issues raised by stakeholders are acknowledged and reported as early in the assessment process as possible to provide maximum opportunity for resolution.
- · Comments from stakeholders are targeted and relevant to each assessment.
- · Responses from the CAB are presented in a way that makes it easy to see how, where, and why the comments have (or have not) been considered.

## Awareness of cultural norms and technical capacity of stakeholders

Different consultation mechanisms may be best for different stakeholders. To ensure stakeholders are provided adequate opportunity to comment on the assessment, the stakeholder consultation process should be designed and carried out in a way that is culturally and technically appropriate for each stakeholder. This may inform how stakeholders are consulted.

Awareness of cultural norms and expectations and the technological capabilities of those to be consulted will contribute to the design and implementation of an appropriate and successful consultation process. For example, there may be specific acceptable channels through which to approach community or tribal leaders, or elected officials. Ignorance or insensitivity regarding these factors, even though unintended, may cause embarrassment or offence to the parties, the CAB, and/or the MSC, and may seriously undermine efforts to obtain useful input.

It is important to understand the technical capacity of individuals or organisations, particularly regarding communications mechanisms such as email, telephones, and videoconferencing. For example, in some circumstances it may be inappropriate to require written input or refer someone to a website for information. In some situations, communication services may be unreliable, or fishers may be at sea for extended periods and unable to communicate promptly. It is also important to understand and consider cultural sensitivities when contacting and planning meetings with different stakeholders.

## Contacting stakeholders

Throughout the FCP, where there is a requirement that stakeholders are contacted, neither the uploading of a document for publication on the MSC website nor the inclusion of a notification in the MSC Fisheries Updates email should be viewed as a substitute for the CAB directly contacting a stakeholder.

## G4.2.1.1 Identifying stakeholders ▲

The MSC takes an inclusive approach when considering the definition of a stakeholder. A stakeholder is a group or individual who may affect or be affected by the outcome of an MSC fisheries assessment. Stakeholder groups may vary from one assessment to another, but will generally fall under these 2 categories:

- 1. Organisations or individuals who can provide information that is relevant to the assessment.
- 2. Organisations or individuals who may be affected by the outcome of an assessment.
- o This includes individuals and organisations that have expressed a particular interest in the assessment, the fishery being considered for certification, or in other resources potentially affected by the fishery.

The only exception to this in MSC fishery assessments is that the organisation seeking certification is considered the client, rather than a stakeholder. The client provides information and input into the assessment in other ways (for example, via the 'MSC Client Document Checklist').

Typical stakeholders may include:

- · Government agencies (with direct fishery management, research responsibility, or responsibility for related resources or research).
- · Non-governmental conservation or other public interest organisations (these may be local, regional, national, and/or international organisations).
- · Academic researchers.
- · Adjacent or potentially affected fisheries (other than the client fishery) or other potentially affected commercial interests (e.g. the post-harvest sector).
- · Community or tribal entities or individuals.

The team should compile a list of potential stakeholders at the start of the assessment or surveillance process. The approach to identifying stakeholders will differ from one assessment or audit to another. As a starting point, the following steps can be taken:

- · If a pre-assessment was undertaken, any stakeholders identified in the pre-assessment process should be included on the stakeholder list.
- · The CAB should ask the client for a list of potential stakeholders. The client will typically have a good idea of the primary parties who have shown interest in the fishery at the local, regional, national and/or international levels. The client is also a good first source of information about any cultural or political issues or sensitivities that should be considered when planning stakeholder consultation. To ensure the client does not withhold information, either intentionally or unintentionally, the CAB should inform the client about:
- o Who can be considered a stakeholder in the context of an MSC fishery assessment.
- o The importance of engaging stakeholders, including those who may be critical of the fishery.
- o The risk of objections if stakeholders are not provided with adequate opportunity to comment during the early stages of an assessment.
- · The CAB should make use of organisational knowledge, including the experience of their assessors, when identifying stakeholders (for example, by considering the stakeholders who expressed interest in similar or nearby assessments).
- · The CAB may contact the MSC to seek information about stakeholders to consider including on the initial contact list. MSC regional staff are often knowledgeable about the stakeholders interested in certain fisheries and may be able to provide information about national and international interest groups (particularly industry, conservation, government entities, academics, and technical experts) who have a history of interest in the fishery in question or a similar one, or in issues that could emerge in the fishery under examination. The MSC cannot, however, provide an exhaustive list of stakeholders for use in the assessment.

Other sources of information that could inform stakeholder lists may include coverage of the fishery or specific fishery issues in the media, interest group publications, and the public record.

Prior to the site visit being announced, the CAB should contact the identified stakeholders to coordinate a date for the site visit that ensures the highest level of attendance. There may be some instances where identified stakeholders cannot be engaged ahead of announcing the full assessment; in such instances, the CAB may choose to postpone the announcement of the site visit date until these stakeholders have been engaged in the process.

## G4.2.2 Consultation announcements ▲

Consultation announcements should be sent at the start of each consultation period. Consultation periods include the following:

- · Announcement of a fishery assessment or reassessment.
- · Announcement of use of the Risk-Based Framework (RBF).
- · Announcement of the Public Comment Draft Report.
- · Announcement of the Final Draft Report.
- · Surveillance audit announcement.
- · Scope extension announcement.

'Relevant stakeholders' should be taken to mean all identified stakeholders, expect for during consultation on the Public Comment Draft Report and Final Draft Report, at which stage only registered stakeholders should be contacted.

As part of consultation announcements, CABs can ask stakeholders contacted to confirm the following, as appropriate to the consultation period:

- · Whether they are interested in providing input on the report or attending the site visit.
- · If an organisation is identified, who the most appropriate contact in the organisation is for matters relating to the fishery assessment or audit.
- · If an individual representing an organisation has been contacted, that the individual is the most appropriate person in the organisation to be contacted.
- · If they are aware of any other stakeholders who should be contacted.

For announcements of fishery assessments or reassessments, stakeholders should be informed that, to engage with the assessment, they must provide comments on the Announcement Comment Draft Report or attend the site visit.

## G4.2.3-4 MSC Templates for Stakeholder Input into Fishery Assessments ▲

The main purpose of the MSC stakeholder input templates is to enable interested parties to easily track how the team considers input provided by stakeholders and incorporates the input into assessments. This ensures that stakeholder input and CAB responses are reported transparently.

<!-- image -->

## G4.2.8 Registering stakeholders ▲

Stakeholders should be considered 'registered' in an assessment if they provide written input on the Announcement Comment Draft Report or provide written or verbal input at the site visit for the ongoing assessment. If stakeholders do not participate during the site visit or comment on the Announcement Comment Draft Report, they cannot comment during later stages of the assessment. At each surveillance audit, and at the start of each reassessment:

- · The full list of stakeholders should be revisited.
- · Any new stakeholders should be added.
- · All stakeholders should be contacted again and offered the opportunity to provide input.

The CAB is encouraged to have stakeholder management systems in place to ensure the correct stakeholders are contacted and provided with adequate opportunity to comment during each part of a fishery assessment. These management systems may go above and beyond the requirements and guidance set out in the FCP and the Guidance to the FCP (GFCP).

If stakeholders do not wish to actively engage with a fishery assessment but would like to be kept updated about progress on the assessment, the CAB is encouraged to support this. Stakeholders can sign up for MSC Fisheries Update emails to keep track of assessments and can also keep up to date with progress via the MSC Track a Fishery website.

## G4.4 Access to information

<!-- image -->

## G4.4.1 Key information ▲

The CAB should interpret 'key information' to mean information that is essential for a stakeholder to have access to so that they are able to properly review the logic that the team has used in scoring rationales.

For information that is available online, the CAB should provide a full reference to make it easy for stakeholders to find this information. Where possible, the CAB should include a hyperlink, and include additional details that can be used to find the information if the hyperlink breaks.

If peer-reviewed literature that is not open access is cited within a public assessment report, the CAB should provide the details required for a stakeholder to find and gain access to the peer-reviewed literature. However, the CAB is not expected to provide this access.

<!-- image -->

## G4.4.1.1 Unpublished information ▲

The CAB can use the 'Supporting Information' annex within the reporting templates to make available information that is unpublished or not online. Alternatively, the CAB may make the information available by sharing it directly with stakeholders and the Peer Review College on request.

## G7 Process requirements

<!-- image -->

## G7.1.7 Communication CAB-client ▲

The CAB should inform the client that failure to prepare properly - if the relevant information is not available, or if critical issues have not been addressed - might mean that the Unit of Assessment (UOA) could fail assessment.

<!-- image -->

## G7.1.8 Information collection related to MSC pre-assessments ▲

The information provided may be aggregated and publicly reported on the MSC website to show regional pre-assessment activities without revealing either the CAB or client identities or other specific fishery details.

This reporting allows the MSC to monitor the number of fisheries that are engaging with the MSC process in different regions of the world and assess the proportions of those fisheries that subsequently enter (as opposed to those who do not enter) full assessment. The example report (Table G1) provides information from the same CAB for a later year and includes a status update for a previously reported pre-assessment.

## G7.3 The MSC Client Document Checklist ▲

The intent of the 'MSC Client Document Checklist' is to ensure that all available information needed to complete the Announcement Comment Draft Report has been collated.

## G7.4 Confirmation that the UoA is within scope of the MSC Fisheries Standard ▲

In the context of the MSC Fisheries Standard 1.1.5 and 1.1.6, if a fishery is not vessel-based, the term 'vessel' should be interpreted as 'individual operators'.

<!-- image -->

## G7.4.7 CAB process if a vessel is excluded ▲

Figure G1 outlines the process for the CAB to follow if the client (or client groups) informs the CAB that a vessel has been removed in relation to the MSC Fisheries Standard 1.1.5.1 or 1.1.6.1. Examples in Figure G1 are for illustrative purposes only.

If a vessel has been excluded or removed from a Unit of Certification (UoC) due to a scope issue related to the MSC Fisheries Standard 1.1.5 and 1.1.6, that vessel may request to re-enter the UoC once it can demonstrate that 2 years have passed since its exclusion or removal. In this instance, the CAB should follow the requirements in Section 7.27.

In cases where fishing operations are not vessel based, the requirement should be interpreted to mean the exclusion of the individual fishing operator that undertook a serious crime or a shark finning offence.

Figure G1: The process the CAB should follow when the client or client groups inform the CAB that a vessel has been removed from the UoA, UoC, and certificate in relation to the MSC Fisheries

Standard 1.1.5.1 or 1.1.6.1.

## G7.5 Scope of assessment: defining the Unit of Assessment and Unit of Certification ▲

MSC certification is specific to the fishery holding the certificate, defined as the Unit of Certification (UoC). The CAB may choose to assess a wider unit as the Unit of Assessment (UoA), to which the certificate may be extended under some circumstances. Both the UoC and UoA need to be defined at the start of assessment.

The MSC allows parts of a fishery (i.e. a combination of stock(s)/gear(s)/vessel(s)) to be certified even if the rest of the fishery is not certified.

## G7.5.2-3 Defining the UoA/UoC ▲

The UoC (i.e. the unit entitled to an MSC certificate) is defined as follows:

'The target stock or stocks (= biologically distinct unit(s)) combined with the fishing gear and vessel type(s) pursuing that stock.'

At its simplest, a single vessel with a single gear could be the UoC, although it is more likely that a UoC would comprise a number of vessels within the same fishery.

The UoA defines the full scope of what is being assessed and is therefore equal to or larger than the UoC. If it is larger, it will include other eligible fishers. Such other eligible fishers exist in cases where a client enters assessment with the aim of initially certifying only part of a fishery (e.g. vessels owned by a single entity), but wishes to have the possibility of expanding the UoC later by the mechanism of certificate sharing.

If the number of fishers within the UoA is greater than the number within the UoC, there are other eligible fishers. If there is any difference between the UoC and UoA, the CAB must communicate this clearly to the MSC and other stakeholders.

Sufficient information should be provided to fully define the scope of the UoA that is to be assessed. In some fisheries, for example, further information may be given on the specific fishing seasons and/or areas that are included. Details could also be provided on which fishing 'fleets' are covered, or licence categories, as used in the management of the UoA. 'Groups' of vessels could also be identified that are not full fleets, but still have some special characteristics, such as membership of an association, or a binding commitment to a code of conduct. In cases where an assessment is intended to cover all fishing activities on a stock within the national waters of a state, there may be no need to individually specify all the different 'fleets' or varieties of vessels that are covered (although the diversity of such vessels and gears should then be considered in scoring). In some cases, individual vessels or 'groups' of vessels owned by a particular client may also be named, if the scope of the assessment is limited to only these vessels.

In defining a UoA/UoC, stocks could be different species, or different 'more or less isolated and selfsustaining' groups within a species. UoAs/UoCs are usually defined for a single species (or stock) and the gear type(s) used to catch that species. The client may prefer more than 1 species, stock, or gear type to be included in a UoA/UoC. The advantages of joint scoring in these cases (e.g. cost savings and simpler tracking in the Chain of Custody (CoC) may outweigh the risk that the failure of one element could result in the failure of the whole UoA.

## G7.5.2.b and G7.5.3.b Defining gear type(s) used in the UoAs/UoCs ▲

'Fishing gear' is defined as the tool with which living aquatic resources are captured. For MSC assessments, gear type is distinguished based on the physical configuration, rather than how the gear is deployed. For example, a beam trawl with sumwing can be classified as a different gear type than a beam trawl with tickler chains, because these have different configurations - in this instance, different accessory equipment. However, beam trawling on sandy bottom and beam trawling on rocky substrate would not constitute the use of different gears and both activities are required to be included in a single UoA.

## Single UoA/UoC with multiple gears

Where there are discrete variations in the type of gear used (such as 2 different mesh sizes used in a standard type of trawl gear), the CAB may include these within a single UoA. The CAB should clearly describe the gears and the variations, and consider these in the assessment and scoring (with any conditions included as normal for &lt;80 scores). If the UoA is certified, the CAB should monitor the use of each gear at surveillance to ensure that the effort applied to each has not changed to the extent that the impact of the UoA has also changed; if this occurs, the CAB should update the scoring. The client and the CAB should note that when 2 or more gear types are scored together, the lower score will determine the result. Decisions on the definition of the UoA should thus reflect the benefits of joint scoring against the risk of an individual analysis on a gear type resulting in a fail for all the others in the UoA.

## Single UoA/UoC with single gear

In cases where the UoA/UoC includes a single gear type, the CAB should consider whether there are any variations in use. If so, the CAB should:

- · Describe these variations and any potential differences in impact on Principle 2 components.
- · Monitor any changes in use at surveillance to ensure the full impact of the variations are considered in scoring.

Examples include, but are not limited to, variations in how the gear is deployed, or variations in type of bait used.

The UoA/UoC must include all activities undertaken for the specified gear. For example, in a UoA where the gear type is purse seine, it may be used in multiple ways, such as setting on a FAD or on a free-school of fish. If the UoA employs multiple set-types, all set-types must be included in the UoA assessment of each gear type.

Such a flexible approach is allowed in order to minimise the complexity of assessment reports as far as possible while ensuring that all fishing impacts for the combined gear types/variations are fully assessed.

## Trading of catch quota between vessels

In cases where catch quotas for certified fish stocks are traded between vessels, fleets, or nations, such catches should be included within the UoA/UoC only if the recipient of the quota is:

- · Already explicitly included within the UoA/UoC and/or recognised as a member of the client group, or
- · Itself certified and catches that fish in conformity with its own UoA/UoC.

Such trading of catch quota does not automatically grant the right to enter catches into MSC certified CoCs, although this may be possible in the above circumstances.

The team should assess the impacts of fishing by any quota recipients consistent with the normal requirement that the Principle 1 assessment covers all impacts on the stock. Any changes in such access arrangements in an existing certified UoA should be considered during surveillance audits.

## Assessment of metapopulations within the UoA/UoC

The MSC requires that fishing activity on Principle 1 species is assessed at a level that is sustainable for the stock. However, the application of the 'stock' concept may vary depending on the knowledge available and complexity in management 1 .

Generally, from the fisheries management point of view, a 'unit stock' can be defined as a group of fish that can be treated as a stock and managed as an independent unit, as long as the results of the

assessment and the impact of management measures do not differ significantly from what they would be in the case of a truly independent stock 2 .

In some cases, stocks may be structured as 'metapopulations' - systems in which local populations (= sub-populations) inhabit discrete habitat patches, and inter-patch dispersal is neither so low as to negate significant demographic connectivity, nor so high as to eliminate any independence of local population (LP) dynamics 3 .

In these cases, the team should consider the connectivity between sub-populations of the metapopulation that defines the underlying source-sink dynamics, and thereby clearly define the actual unit stock that is to be assessed against Principle 1.

Connectivity patterns range from a well-mixed larval pool (maximal connectivity) at one extreme to a collection of closed self-sustaining populations (minimal connectivity) at the other. However, most situations are intermediate to these two extremes. Connectivity is rarely symmetrical, and larval flows between 2 subpopulations will nearly always be stronger in 1 direction with maximum asymmetry found in non-reproductive pseudo-populations (absolute sinks). Source-sink models describe a situation where larvae or adults from source locations supplement less-productive sink areas. In a sink location, reproduction is insufficient to balance local mortality, and the LP therefore persists only because it receives immigration from more-productive sources. Source locations are considered net exporters of individuals whereas sinks are net importers of individuals.

The degree of self-recruitment and connectivity among sub-populations dictates the specific management required to achieve a sustainable harvest. Where management recognises a metapopulation, it may need to ensure that fishing effort and catches consider the abundance or biomass in each local population.

In cases where fisheries are targeting a mixture of LPs that cannot be clearly separated, a practical management approach may be to consider the whole metapopulation as the unit stock. In this case, more precautionary reference points or other adjustments to the harvest strategy may be needed to allow for uncertainties in the stock structure. However, where appropriate and justified, 1 or more LPs can also be designated as the unit stock(s) on which the outcome and harvest strategy components are to be assessed.

The team should be alert to the special issues of metapopulation in assessing a UoA. At the time of reporting on the fishery assessment, the team should include detailed information in the assessment report, clarifying whether the unit stock is based on 1 or more LPs or on a metapopulation as a whole. Details should be provided on the appropriateness of the level of assessment and management chosen, explaining:

- · In the case that management is based on the whole metapopulation, how it is expected to avoid local depletion.
- · If based on 1 or more local populations:
- o Whether these are believed to be sources or sinks.
- o The relationship among subpopulations.
- o How management avoids over-exploitation within both the selected local populations and more broadly in the whole metapopulation.

Table G2 shows the level of assessment expected and considerations for scoring the stock outcome and harvest strategy components of a unit stock for a normal single population stock (case A), and for 3 different forms of metapopulations (cases B, C, and D). Teams should note that harmonisation between Principle 1 assessments would normally be expected only in cases where 2 fisheries are fully overlapping in their definition of the unit stock. Fisheries on 2 separate LPs within a wider metapopulation, for example, need not have harmonised outcomes.

## G7.5.4 Defining the UoA and UoC by subset of activities ▲

While the MSC allows a portion of the fishery to be certified, it does not allow the UoA or UoC to be defined by a subset of activities undertaken with the stock(s)/gear(s) combination. For example, if assessing a fishery using a purse seine with multiple set types such as FAD-set and free school-set, the CAB should include all set-types within the UoA and UoC.

<!-- image -->

## G7.5.5 Definition of UoA at time of fishing ▲

The CAB should define the UoA based on the gears that are used. The CAB should not define a UoA based on the species caught as observed at the time of landing. The CAB should include in the assessment all potential impacts of the UoA from all hauls or landings that are defined as having been taken by the gear type and in the area defined in the UoA. The CAB should not define the UoA based on, for instance, a subset of hauls that are defined as targeting a Principle 1 species and for which a calculation of the proportion of the catch that includes that Principle 1 species is required.

## G7.5.6 Geographical area of the fishery ▲

<!-- image -->

This is a description of the geographical area within which the fishery is undertaken. It should include the following:

- · FAO Major Fishing Area, identified by name and two-digit code (www.fao.org/cwp-on-fisherystatistics/handbook).
- · Commonly used name for the body of water (e.g. North Sea).
- · Local fisheries management area (e.g. ICES divisions VI, VII, and VIII abc).
- · Stock region, which may be all or part of the biological stock unit assessed in Principle 1.

In defining the geographical area, the CAB should consider the fishery client's ability to track and trace to it, as per 7.5.10 (initial traceability risk assessment) and Section 7.17 (Determination of the traceability systems and point(s) at which fish and fish products enter further certified Chains of Custody).

<!-- image -->

## G7.5.7 Principle 1 and Principle 2 species components ▲

The team does not need to define all P2 species within the UoA and UoC. However, the team needs to demonstrate that 7.5.7 has been applied to determine and rationalise species being assessed within Principle 1 and 2. This rationale should be presented in sections 10.1 (P1) and 10.2 (P2) respectively of the 'MSC Reporting Template'.

## G7.5.8 Changes to UoC/UoA ▲

During an assessment, the CAB should limit changes to the UoA and proposed UoC to the target stocks identified for consideration under Principle 1, as per 7.15.3. The MSC recognises that stocks initially proposed as target stocks (and assessed under Principle 1) may be recategorised as in-scope species and assessed under Principle 2.

For example, a client may want to propose multiple species for consideration under Principle 1, but the CAB may not have sufficient information to confirm whether that species is best assessed under Principle 1 or Principle 2 until after the site visit. A CAB may therefore confirm the species to be assessed under Principle 1 after the site visit, to be formally confirmed within the Public Comment Draft Report, see 7.15.3.

It is not the MSC's intent that the CAB announces a provisional UoA and adds additional target stocks or gear types or makes other changes during an assessment except those in 7.15.3.

The CAB should consider whether any changes to the UoA or UoC made during an assessment will have an impact on the traceability and ability to trace and identify product to each UoC.

## G7.5.9 Withdrawing a UoA and proposed UoC during the assessment ▲

For fishery assessments with multiple UoAs and proposed UoCs, a client may decide to withdraw 1 or more UoAs and proposed UoCs during the assessment process, for example to remove a gear type.

## G7.5.10 Review of traceability factors ▲

The intent of this section is to assure that the UoCs are defined in such a way that it will be possible for the fishery client to trace and identify them, in order to be eligible to sell product as MSC certified. The CAB will consider the risks that affect this as detailed in the clause. The risk of vessels outside the UoC fishing on the same stock is relevant where this is for commercial purposes (i.e. intending to sell on this catch rather than discard it). Other risks of substitution may occur between point of harvest and point of sale to any party not covered by the fishery certificate, for example transhipment of product between a catch vessel in the UoC and another vessel, or sale via auction.

## G7.5.10.1 Notification of obligation to meet traceability requirements ▲

Fisheries may have systems in place to manage traceability but may not be fully aware of MSC traceability requirements until later in the assessment process, particularly if the UoC does not cover the entire fishery. The intent of this requirement is to enable clear communication with the client group so that they are aware of the traceability requirements early in the assessment process. Key traceability risks can be documented in the traceability section of the 'MSC Reporting Template', and the client will have more time to implement traceability solutions during the remainder of the assessment process.

## G7.5.11 Other eligible fishers and entities, and certificate sharing ▲

The MSC has the following intent regarding its certification program and certificate sharing:

- · To minimise the number of overlapping assessments requiring harmonisation.
- · To encourage the largest proportion of fishers to enter at the start of the full assessment process, but when only a select group of fishers within a fishery wants to undertake MSC assessment, to allow them to proceed so as not to delay certification.
- · To ensure that the process is clear and transparent to interested parties.

This arrangement defines which other eligible fishers may gain access to the fishery certificate, if and when the fishery is certified.

Certificate-sharing mechanisms developed in existing MSC fisheries include a number of arrangements, such as the provision of unrestricted access to the certificate, providing that certification and surveillance costs:

- · Are shared fairly and equitably with all participants.
- · Are met through the payment of a landing levy or some other approach agreed within the client group, and/or
- · That all product is initially sold to the certificate holder.

The MSC recognises the role of individual fishery clients in devising mechanisms that are appropriate to their circumstances. There are no formal, mandatory arrangements for the development of certificate-sharing mechanisms.

The guidance below provides suggestions rather than directions to clients and their potential partners for their use and/or inclusion in any certificate-sharing mechanisms. The CAB may wish to provide the advice in Box G1 to fisheries.

Box G1: The MSC's advice on allocating costs of certificate sharing

The MSC provides this non-binding advice to certificate holders on the sharing of certificate costs. The CAB may wish to provide this information to those involved in certificate sharing.

When a client allows access to a certificate and seeks proportional reimbursement of the initial costs paid either as a one-off payment or as an ongoing cost-sharing mechanism, this guidance suggests how these costs could be calculated. Costs may include the following:

- a) Direct costs paid to a CAB.
- b) Direct costs that the client incurs in managing or facilitating the assessment.
- c) Cost of the client's time spent managing/facilitating the assessment process.
- d) Risk premium, a maximum of 20% of the other assessment costs.

If costs additional to those identified above are included in the proposed certificate-sharing mechanism, they must be documented and justified in any and all communication about the proposed sharing mechanism.

Allowable costs would not be expected to include any grant or subsidy made to the client to cover the costs incurred during the assessment, except where a proportion of such grants or subsidies are subsequently repaid.

The direct costs and the time costs that the client incurs in managing or facilitating the assessment may either be costed directly from the client's accounts or estimated as a simple overhead rate.

Where the direct and time costs are to be estimated from the client's accounts, the CAB will make full details available to other fishers seeking to gain entry to the certificate. If audited accounts detailing these costs are required, the other eligible fishers will pay the costs incurred in conducting such audits. The cost of the client's time will be based on the earnings records for the individuals involved. The client will record and substantiate time inputs recorded.

Where the client's direct and time costs are to be estimated according to an overhead rate, this rate should not exceed 30% of the fees paid to the CAB. In this case, the following formula is suggested for calculating the overall cost to be shared:

(Costs x overhead) x risk premium

Where the rates for the overhead and risk premium are set at the proposed upper limits of 30% and 20%, respectively, the overall cost is calculated from the following formula:

((Direct cost paid to the CAB less any cost paid for a consultant) x 1.3) x 1.2

Costs (both for entry and maintenance to the certificate, including the fulfilment of conditions) would be apportioned to the new entrant(s) seeking certification in accordance to the mechanism.

Examples could include, but are not limited to, a pro rata sharing of costs based on:

- e) The number of vessels (or operators) or processing or marketing entities seeking entry as a proportion of those documented as originally included in the UoC, or
- f) The quota held by the new vessel(s) (or operators) or processing or marketing entities seeking entry, as a proportion of those documented as originally included in the UoC, or
- g) The increase in fishing power of new vessel(s) (or operators) or processing or marketing capacity seeking entry pro rata to those documented as originally included in the UoC.

If additional fishers or processing or marketing entities seek to join the certificate after an initial and successful certificate-sharing negotiation, a rebate may be due to those who joined the certificate previously. Alternatively, potential costs may be apportioned between all the fishers who are potentially eligible to share the certificate, and payments made by sub-sets of fishers only in proportion to their share of the overall costs (thus avoiding the need for rebates if other fishers join later). Such cost-sharing mechanisms will be detailed to stakeholders when an assessment is undertaken.

## G7.5.12 Inseparable or practicably inseparable stock(s) ▲

The intent of the requirements for inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) stocks is to:

- · Create incentives to promote the improved management of non-target stock(s), for example to bring to Principle 1 level of performance or encourage adoption of a mechanism for catch separation.
- · Allow a defined and limited proportion of catches of IPI stock(s) to enter further certified Chains of Custody and use the MSC ecolabel.

The requirements for IPI stock(s) acknowledge that Principle 2 catch can be practicably inseparable from the Principle 1 catch during normal fishing operations. For example, the Principle 2 catch may be from a stock of the same species, or a closely related species. As an extreme example, the Principle 2 species may only be distinguishable by the number of gill rakers or the number of rays in the caudal fin. These requirements also acknowledge that, even when the Principle 2 catch is distinguishable, it may not be commercially feasible to separate the catch (i.e. significant modification to existing harvesting and processing methods would be required).

The intent of the IPI requirements is to incentivise management of these species to Principle 1 level, or to encourage adoption of a mechanism for separation. As a result, IPI is only valid for 1 certification period, unless the proportion is &lt;2%.

Requirements for IPI stock(s) are designed to improve consistency in the application of the MSC FCP. The requirements on IPI stock(s) vary based on the percentage in the catch:

- · If the proportion of IPI catches to total target + IPI catches is less than or equal to 2%, the CAB needs to make an assessment that the UoA does not create a significant impact on the IPI stock but is not required to apply PA1.4.2. The CAB is also not required to make a further determination of status under Principle 2, although the IPI stock is effectively held to the same requirement as Principle 2 in that the UoA should not be creating a significant impact on the IPI stock.
- · If the proportion is greater than 2% and less than 15%, Annex PA is to be applied in its entirety, including an assessment against Principle 2 in-scope species PIs and considering the impact of all fishing activity.
- · The CAB should take into account the variability of the catch composition over the last 5 years or fishing seasons. Depending on data availability and species characteristics, the team may choose a different length of the time series, but a rationale should be provided in all cases for the method chosen. Species characteristics may include life history (e.g. longevity or generation time), time scales of production variability (e.g. decadal-scale vs. shorter time frames), and regulatory periods that affect spatial distribution of the fishing activity. There should be a good understanding of the long-term average catch composition of IPI species.

Note that the MSC restricts the application of the requirements for IPI stocks to a fishery certification to 1 certification period. At reassessment, IPI stock(s) should:

- · Be separated from target stock(s), or
- · The proportion of IPI should be reduced to 2%, or
- · The IPI stock(s) should be assessed against Principle 1.

G7.7

Preparing for the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

## G7.7.1 Fishery with enhanced stock ▲

<!-- image -->

## Background

The intent is that management systems exist to control exploitation rates on wild stocks in order to allow for self-sustaining, locally adapted wild stocks (i.e. adequate wild stock levels that can perpetuate themselves at harvestable levels on a continuing basis, consistent with Principle 1). The management of enhancement activities related to the fishery should not prevent the ability of wild stocks to sustain themselves at their optimum levels, according to their natural habitat-related and biologically based productive capacities.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.1.2.b Extent of translocations ▲

For these requirements, translocation does not include the transfer of species to outside the distribution of their native range. The latter should be considered as an introduction of a species, to be considered under MSC Fisheries Standard Section SD.

The extent of translocation must be considered to ensure that the fishery enhancement programs predominantly utilise stocks or populations that are native to the natural production area from which the UoA's catch originates.

The means of confirming that fish are 'native' to a fishery production area (i.e. from within the 'natural range') may not be simple, except in cases where no movement occurs.

PIs may need to be developed to determine the extent of movement within a range that can be considered to have acceptably low risks. Related performance assessment will require the identification of the 'natural production area' or genetic range of a stock.

Translocation of fish/shellfish in enhanced fisheries should ensure that fisheries maintain the diversity, structure, and function of the ecosystem on which they depend while minimising any adverse effects. Inadequately managed translocations of fish/shellfish between different areas may have genetic and other impacts that need to be assessed (e.g. the spread of diseases between areas, or accidental species introductions).

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.1.2.c.i Other interventions  ▲

Currently, the MSC Fisheries Standard does not cover the issues of feed augmentation and the use of medicines or other chemical compounds.

Examples of other interventions used in catch and grow (CAG) systems include:

- · Fertilisation to enhance natural food availability, or
- · Removal of predators or competitors, either to maximise capture or minimise post-capture mortality.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.1.2.d Habitat modification ▲

The cumulative impacts of multiple production operations, areas, facilities and systems within a geographical region must be considered.

For example, a small mussel rope facility may have minimal impact on the natural ecosystem's structure and function, but filling a whole bay with such structures may have much greater impacts.

Consideration is needed for those situations where an individual operation is the subject of an assessment under the MSC Program but is only 1 of several similar operations in a finite space. The assessment should consider whether the cumulative impacts of a particular production system are likely to cause serious or irreversible harm to the natural ecosystem's structure and function.

<!-- image -->

## G7.8 The Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The MSC's intent is that the drafting of the Announcement Comment Draft Report is a desk-based exercise using information provided in the 'MSC Client Document Checklist'. However, additional resources that are readily available can also be used. For an initial assessment, information available in pre-assessments or from Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) may be used. For a reassessment, information in the previous Public Certification Report and surveillance audit reports may be used. The Announcement Comment Draft Report provides indicative scoring and rationales, and identifies where more information is needed.

One of the objectives of the Announcement Comment Draft Report is to assist the site visit by facilitating stakeholder input to the assessment before the site visit. The Announcement Comment Draft Report also ensures the CAB, the client, and stakeholders are better informed and prepared for the site visit.

The Announcement Comment Draft Report includes an initial review of traceability risks identified in the 'MSC Client Document Checklist' stage, the proposed point of change of ownership of product to any party not covered by the fishery certificate, and the point from which subsequent CoC certification is proposed. The full review of risks and mitigation, determination on eligibility of product, and additional description of traceability is completed after, and informed by, the site visit as per Section 7.14.

## G7.8.1 Preparing the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The MSC does not expect assessment teams to conduct stakeholder interviews or site visits for the purposes of completing the Announcement Comment Draft Report. If a CAB chooses to conduct stakeholder interviews or site visits during the drafting of the Announcement Comment Draft Report, this will not count towards meeting the requirements in Section 7.14.

<!-- image -->

## G7.8.2.g.i Harmonisation for the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The MSC's intent regarding preparation for harmonisation no later than the site visit is that the CAB identifies overlapping UoAs and the need for harmonisation, and informs the relevant CABs that harmonisation discussions might be needed after the site visit.

The MSC does not expect the team to have had harmonisation discussions with other assessment teams of overlapping fisheries to produce the Announcement Comment Draft Report.

<!-- image -->

## G7.10 Announcement of fishery assessment ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.10.4.b Pre-assessment reports uploaded to database ▲

The MSC will maintain confidentiality of pre-assessment reports. The client may require the MSC to sign a confidentiality agreement.

<!-- image -->

## G7.10.5.1 Modifications to the default tree ▲

The CAB should draft quantitative PIs, where appropriate. For example:

- · Potential biological removals (PBR) of marine mammals - where fishing activity does not impede the recovery rate of populations.

- · Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) - the UoA is at or above MSY, or biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY), or some other variation of an appropriate fisheries management reference point.

<!-- image -->

## G7.12 Peer Review College ▲

The MSC has set up a Peer Review College to fulfil the following objectives:

- · Increase the independence of peer reviews of fishery assessments.
- · Increase the quality and consistency of peer reviews, and the reliability of their use by CABs, stakeholders and independent adjudicators.
- · Not to increase, and if possible reduce, the cost of peer reviewers to fishery clients undergoing assessment.

The CAB will need to request peer reviewers from the College according to the requirements in Section 7.12. The operations of the College are described separately to this guidance. Peer reviewers will have similar competencies to auditors.

<!-- image -->

## G7.12.3.b Proposed peer reviewers after the site visit ▲

Following the site visit:

- · The Peer Review College will ensure that all registered stakeholders are proactively invited to comment on the potential conflicts of interest of the proposed peer reviewers for a period of 10 days.
- · The College will review any conflicts of interest highlighted by stakeholders, in accordance with the procedures outlined in the FCP.

If stakeholders do not agree with the Peer Review College's determination on conflict of interest:

- · They have the right to appeal to the Peer Review College who shall inform the MSC within 10 working days.
- · The MSC will appoint a third party to conduct a review of the decision.
- · The MSC Executive will inform the Peer Review College of the outcome of the review.
- · The MSC Executive will provide instructions on how the Peer Review College should proceed.

Once the consultation and appeals process is complete and the Peer Review College has acted as directed by the third party, the CAB and stakeholders will be informed of the decision that no conflict of interest exists for the peer reviewers appointed to conduct the peer review.

<!-- image -->

## G7.12.5 Final decision peer reviewers ▲

The CAB can express a preference for individual reviewers to be contracted from a shortlist drawn up by the Peer Review College. However, the Peer Review College will make the final decision.

<!-- image -->

## G7.13 Stakeholder input on the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

## G7.13.4 Publish stakeholder input on the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The CAB should upload the stakeholder input in a timely manner to the MSC database for publication on the MSC website. The purpose of publication is to keep the stakeholders informed before the site visit about what has been raised. Additionally, the stakeholder input is useful for the assessment team to prepare the site visit.

<!-- image -->

## G7.14 Site visits, stakeholder input, and information collection ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.14.1 Additional site visits ▲

The team may require further site visits by 1 or more team members where:

- · Information is not available, or
- · The client or stakeholders have not assembled information in time for the first assessment visit to adequately assess and analyse the evidence.

•

<!-- image -->

## G7.15 Scoring the UoA ▲

## Background

This is the stage where the information gathered in the formal assessment is evaluated, and scores are assigned and justified.

Guidance for scoring the UoA using the RBF is given in the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.1-2 Scoring decision ▲

The MSC's intent is that the full team appointed by the CAB agrees the scoring of the UoA. Although individual team members may lead on the scoring of a particular Principle, their conclusions should be agreed in discussion with the team as a whole. Discussions on scoring may begin at the site visit. However, these discussions often cannot be completed until after the team has dispersed, when virtual interactions may be needed; for example, by teleconference and exchange of emails.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.5.1 Smaller scoring intervals ▲

The team may need to assign scores in intervals smaller than 5 when considering the complexity generated by multiple scoring issues (SIs) and scoring elements.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.7.3 Terms used ▲

In considering the scoring of individual PIs based on the performance of different scoring elements, the team should use the terms below:

- · Few: most of the SIs should be taken to indicate 'minority:majority' or 'less than half:greater than half. For example, if there were 3 or 4 SIs, the ratios '1:2' and '1:3' would be represented by the terms 'few:most').
- · Some: 'some' should be taken to indicate a roughly equal split of SIs.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.8 Weighting ▲

Table G3 below shows the default weighting when using the default tree.

This information can be found in the 'MSC Fishery Assessment Default Scoring Worksheet'.

## G7.15.9 Weighting to be applied in enhanced salmon fisheries ▲

Default weighting is applied in the 'MSC Fishery Assessment Default Scoring Worksheet', adjusted as appropriate for the additional PIs in salmon fisheries.

## G7.15.10.1 Scoring rationale ▲

The report's text should include explicit rationales for all scores.

## Example: Rationale for a score of 75 in Principle 2 (In-scope species, Management PI 2.1.2)

The rationale for a score of 75 for PI 2.1.2 might read as follows:

There are 5 in-scope species and therefore 5 scoring elements.

- 1. For 3 of them, catch by weight of that species is less than 5% of the UoA's total catch, so they would not be considered 'main'. For these species, there is a management strategy in place that:
- o Is primarily designed for the fisheries that target these 3 species.
- o Recognises limit reference points (LRPs) that are based on sensible assumptions about the stock.

Although there is evidence that this strategy works in similar fisheries, there is no evidence directly about the UoA that shows it is achieving its objectives. None of the species is a shark, so the shark-finning SI is not scored. All 3 species are landed and sold; additionally, the team considers that unobserved mortality is negligible based on research of similar fisheries. Given these points, the unwanted catch SI is not triggered. As the ghost gear SI has been scored in PI2.2.2, the ghost gear SI within this PI is not scored (this applies to all in-scope species scored within this PI).

Given the information above, only SIs (a) and (b) are scored for the minor species scoring elements. As none of the species are main:

- o They all meet the Scoring Guidepost (SG)80 requirements by default.
- o They meet the SG100 requirements for SI (a) - strategy in place.
- o They do not meet the SG100 for SI (b) - strategy effectiveness.

These 3 species would each score 85 for each scoring element.

- 2. A fourth species (hake):
- o Is a major target species of high value to another fishery.
- o Is assessed and managed rigorously.
- o Makes up 20% of the UoA catch.
- o Has quotas applied to the UoA and its major target fishery that are effectively monitored and enforced. Evidence indicates that there is a high degree of certainty that the stock status is above the PRI.
- o Is landed and sold; additionally, the team has determined that unobserved mortality is negligible based on published research of similar fisheries. Given these points, unwanted catch SI (c) is not triggered.
- o Is not a shark species so SI (d) on shark finning is not scored

Given the information above, only SIs (a) and (b) are scored and this scoring element meets the SG100 requirements.

- 3. The fifth species is a deepwater species that is:
- o Managed using reference points and robust harvest control rules (HCRs).
- o Well above its PRI.
- o Not utilised, and most of the catch is thrown back with a high mortality rate.
- o Is not a shark species so SI (d) on shark finning is not scored.

- o The UoA has reviewed current measures to minimise capture of this species as well as other measures. A cost-effective and practical measure was identified, but it has not yet been implemented.

Given the information above, SIs (a), (b) and (c) are scored for this scoring element. This species meets SG80 for SIs (a) and (b) but only meets SG60 for SI (c). This scoring element receives a 75.

Based on the SGs, in the above scenario, 3 of the species achieve a score of 90, 1 achieves a score of 100 and 1 achieves a score of 75. According to Table G7, all of the scoring elements meet the SG60 level, and most achieve higher performance at or exceeding the SG80 level. Only 1 does not achieve the SG80 level. Therefore, using Table G7, the appropriate overall PI score would be 75. This is because, as stated in 7.15.11.b, if any single scoring element fails to meet the SG80 level, the overall score for that element shall be less than 80. In such cases, a condition is raised, regardless of whether any other elements are at the SG100 level.

The rationale for this scoring result is shown in tabular form below.

## G7.15.11.c Terms used ▲

In considering the scoring of individual PIs based on the performance of different scoring elements, the terms below should be used:

- · Few: Most of the scoring elements should be taken to indicate 'minority:majority' or 'less than half:greater than half' (e.g. if there were 6 scoring elements, the ratios '1:5' and '2:4' would both be represented by the terms 'few:most').
- · Some: 'Some' should be taken to indicate a roughly equal split of scoring elements.

## Scoring of minor species and habitats

For 'minor' species and habitats, SGs only exist at the SG100 level in some PIs (2.1.1-2.2.3, 2.3.1, and 2.3.3). When scoring such 'minor' species or habitats as scoring elements, the team should assume that the SG80 level is met by default, such that the scores are simply based on how many of the SIs that apply to 'minor' (or all) species/habitats are met at the SG100 level.

## Examples: scoring elements

- · Where most elements did not meet the SG80 level, indicating an overall score of 65, but generally scored high intermediate scores, a higher overall score would be appropriate (e.g. 70). However, if the elements score only low intermediate scores, a score of 65 or below would remain appropriate.
- · Where only a few elements failed to achieve the SG80 level, suggesting an overall score of 75, but achieved low intermediate scores, a lower score (e.g. 70) would be appropriate.
- · Where some elements met the SG100 level but some only met the SG60 level, suggesting a score of 70, it may be appropriate to reflect the very high performance of some of the elements with an upwards adjustment to 75.

<!-- image -->

## G7.16 Setting conditions ▲

## Background

Conditions provide for agreed further improvement in the UoA and provide one of the bases for subsequent audits. They are intended to improve performance against the MSC Fisheries Standard, in terms of target species status, maintenance of ecological function, and management system performance.

If scores of less than 80 are awarded, then measurable, outcome-oriented, and time-bounded conditions of certification are prepared.

Conditions can relate to:

- · Reducing uncertainty.
- · Improving processes and/or implementation.
- · Reducing risk.
- · Improving outcomes.

These elements can be hierarchical and may be linked together in pursuing a longer-term outcome and potential continuous improvement.

<!-- image -->

## G7.16.2 Drafting conditions ▲

The CAB should draft conditions that articulate the outcome that needs to be achieved by the condition deadline. This should reflect the language used in the SG80 PISG and draw upon relevant text in the MSC Fisheries Standard Section SA clauses and guidance. The CAB should not simply repeat the SG80 PISG.

<!-- image -->

## G7.16.6 Exceptional circumstances ▲

Exceptional circumstances should be applied:

- · When a condition is first drafted during assessment and before certification, or
- · At a surveillance audit if a new condition is raised.

## Examples: exceptional circumstances

Examples of exceptional circumstances are the time taken for:

- · Natural ecological functions and response times.
- · Relevant research to be funded, undertaken, and published.

## G7.17 Assessment of the traceability systems and determination of the

point(s) at which fish and fish products enter certified Chains of Custody ▲

## Background

Fisheries often have robust systems in place to manage traceability, through regulatory or voluntary controls. However, these systems may not be sufficient for differentiating between certified and noncertified products, especially if the UoC only covers specific vessels or gear types. The intention of this section is to enable clearer documentation of the traceability systems in place for a certified fishery and to make clear how substitution risks are adequately controlled by the fishery client. This can be informed through the site visit and completed in the 'MSC Reporting Template' after the site visit and before the Public Comment Draft Report.

The intent of this section is to ensure that all fishery assessment reports clearly:

- · Describe the systems that ensure product segregation and identification to the UoC for all activities and product movements covered by the fishery certificate.
- · Identify risks of substitution or mislabelling of certified products.
- · Explain how the traceability systems and controls in place mitigate these risks.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.1 &amp; 7.17.1.2  Traceability record keeping ▲

Traceability systems need to be sufficient to allow the fishery client to trace MSC certified sales back to the individual UoC. The MSC may request the traceability records for a product traceback or an investigation into an MSC supply chain.

The client will need to trace back to an individual UoC, which means that segregation and identification to each UoC are needed. In some cases, segregation may not be practical throughout handling but will always be ultimately possible prior to or at the start of CoC. An example of this would be where visually distinguishable species (some covered by the UoC and some not) are caught together, and sorting by species happens upon landing. This assures that should a UoC voluntarily leave or be suspended, it is possible to continue trading certified product.

Records demonstrating traceability back to the UoC should be kept for at least 2 years where practicable, to allow a product from the supply chain to be traced back to the UoC.

Traceability records can be maintained by fishers, the fishery client group, auctions, or other entities, depending on the management of the UoA and the point at which subsequent Chain of Custody begins.

## G7.17.1.3 High seas transhipment ▲

High seas transhipment brings higher risks of substitution or mislabelling of MSC certified fish and fish products. Examples of sufficient systems for high seas transhipment include 100% observer coverage or independently verified electronic monitoring.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.1.4 and G7.17.6.e Risk factors and mitigation ▲

Mitigation measures can include existing regulatory and traceability controls, such as logbooks, but should consider whether these systems are sufficient to ensure traceability back to the UoC. If not, additional systems or controls may need to be implemented.

Several possible risk factors exist:

## · The possibility that non-certified gears are used within the UoA.

This concerns cases where vessels within the UoA may use gear types that are not included in the UoC. This can happen on the same trip where certified gears are used, or can happen on

different trips. This can lead to a greater risk of mixing between certified and non-certified product on vessels or at points of landing, and the UoA needs adequate systems in place to segregate and identify the certified catch from non-certified catch.

## · The possibility of vessels from the UoC fishing outside the UoC or in different geographical areas (on the same trips or different trips).

This concerns the potential for vessels to fish in non-certified geographical regions (which may also be affected by fishing-season or temporal restrictions). This can lead to a greater risk of mixing between certified and non-certified product on vessels or at points of landing. The UoA will need to demonstrate how traceability and control systems (such as vessel monitoring systems or logbooks) help to ensure that only product caught within the UoC will be identified and sold as MSC certified.

## · The possibility of vessels from outside the UoC or client group fishing the same stock.

This concerns the likelihood that other, non-certified fishers may catch the same stock, which could produce higher risks of substitution or mislabelling at the point of landing or sale (for example, where certified and non-certified catches are sold at the same auction).

## · Transhipment, especially high seas transhipment.

Where high seas transhipment occurs, Chain of Custody is needed unless there are independently verified systems to cover the fishing and receiving vessels for all transhipment events.

## · Any other risks of substitution between fish from the UoC and fish from outside this unit.

This refers to any other points at harvest, on the vessel, during transhipment, or at points of landing or sale where there is the potential risk of substitution between non-certified and certified products. This also includes the presence of other nearby fisheries activities or other fisheries where non-certified product may be landed or transhipped alongside certified catches. This assessment should consider the presence of these risks and specifically how they are addressed by the traceability systems in place.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.6 Documented in the 'MSC reporting template' ▲

Clear information on the UoC must be available to stakeholders and particularly any party purchasing certified product from the fishery client. The change of ownership relates to the first point of sale to any party not covered by the fishery certificate. Any specific conditions related to eligibility of product from the UoC to bear the MSC ecolabel should be clearly stated in this section (for example, if roe is not considered within the UoC).

If sales agents or non-fisher client group members are confirmed as included in the fishery certificate, Chain of Custody could be required to start from the point of sale by the sales agent or client group member, and these entities need to be assessed as per 7.17.1.1. All entities that handle or trade product between harvest and start of CoC (such as transhipment, unloaders, offloaders, storage, and transport) will also be considered under 7.17.1.1.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.6.c Critical tracking events ▲

Critical tracking events are all events that need to be recorded in order to allow for effective traceability of products. The critical tracking events within the fishery certificate could include transhipment, offloading at landing, sorting at auction, or sale by sales agent.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.6.1 CoC auditor review ▲

The CoC auditor may be a member of the team and involved at each stage, or may be a reviewer who is only involved after the site visit in reviewing and making recommendations on improving clarity and detail of the traceability sections in the 'MSC Reporting Template'. The team can then edit the 'MSC Reporting Template' prior to publication of the Public Comment Draft Report and improve its clarity for buyers and other stakeholders interested in traceability.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.7 Non-conforming product ▲

This clause provides consistency with the requirements for CoC certificate holders. Fisheries have a responsibility to ensure that any non-eligible (non-conforming) product that enters the supply chain is identified, and downstream supply chain companies are appropriately notified. For example, if product from outside the UoC is accidentally labelled or sold as MSC certified, the UoA would need to take action in line with this procedure.

## G7.18 Determination of eligibility date ▲

## Background

The MSC has developed requirements on eligibility dates to clarify the date from when the MSC ecolabel could be used on fishery products caught before the eventual fishery certificate date, and to promote consistency of approach across fisheries. The intent of a flexible eligibility date is to:

- · Outline the situations under which fishery products caught before the date of certification of a fishery may be considered to have come from a sustainable fishery and be eligible for use of the MSC ecolabel.
- · Allow fisheries to use the MSC ecolabel and make claims for fish products that are sold after the fishery certificate is awarded, but that are caught before this date.
- · Ensure that the MSC Chain of Custody is maintained and that only products from certified fisheries use the MSC ecolabel.

<!-- image -->

## G7.18.1.1 Eligibility date ▲

The eligibility date needs to be included in the Public Comment Draft Report as per 7.20.3.k.

In cases where the UoC could change (e.g. due to some regions or fishing gears being omitted at a late stage), or there could be further delays to the assessment process, the CAB may choose to set the eligibility date as the certification date, rather than the Public Comment Draft Report date.

In cases where the eligibility date is set before the certification date, the CAB will need to consider any potential traceability impacts, and risks including that of product from outside the UoC being incorrectly identified as under-assessment product. Accordingly, the CAB should verify traceability and identification systems before the eligibility date.

Fisheries handling under-assessment product should be aware of relevant requirements in the Chain of Custody Standard on identification and traceability of under-assessment product.

## G7.19 The Client and Peer Review Draft Report ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.19.5.a Address peer reviewer comments by CAB ▲

The team should note that reviewers will have the right of reply to the team's conclusion during the Public Comment Draft Report stakeholder consultation in common with other peer review processes, such as those used by scientific journals. The reviewer's reply would state whether they agreed or disagreed with the team's response, as this could assist with the MSC Disputes Process. In the Final Draft Report, the CAB should include a response to any peer reviewer follow-up comments made on the Public Comment Draft Report.

If any of the peer reviewers' comments are contradictory, the team should provide justified responses for each different comment. It may be possible that the team agrees with some of the peer reviewers' comments, but not all. The team should provide clear justifications for all of their responses, including references to the relevant MSC requirements (Standard and/or FCP), and any MSC interpretations or derogations, as appropriate.

The above also applies to the team's responses to 2 or more sets of stakeholder comments where these are interpreted as contradictory.

<!-- image -->

## G7.19.6 Report viewed by the client ▲

The client has up to 60 days to consider and respond to the report. If the client response is received before the end of the 60-day period and the peer review is complete, the CAB can move on to the next assessment stage without waiting for the full 60 days to elapse.

<!-- image -->

## G7.19.7 Preparation of the Client Action Plan by the client ▲

Specific parts of the Client Action Plan may cover more than 1 PI even though each PI must have its own condition. However, the Client Action Plan should refer to these specific conditions and their milestones.

The CAB should not be prescriptive about the means of meeting conditions. The fishery client may develop its own corrective actions and deal with a condition in its own way. The important points for the CAB are that the client must demonstrate to the CAB's satisfaction that a condition can be met and how the outcome or result will be (or has been) achieved.

## G7.20 The Public Comment Draft Report ▲

## G7.20.4.1 References in Public Comment Draft Report ▲

The reference should include identifying details such as number, author, and date.

## G7.21 Determination ▲

The CAB should also refer to the MSC General Certification Requirements (GCR) and ISO 17065.

The determination is a recommendation the team makes to the CAB's decision-making entity.

## G7.22.3 CAB response to stakeholder input ▲

During the 30-day Public Comment Draft Report consultation, registered stakeholders may provide follow-up comments to the CAB's responses to their previous input.

Registered stakeholders may also provide input at Public Comment Draft Report stage on issues they have not previously raised, providing that the information the comments are based on was available on or before the site visit.

## G7.24.7.1 The Fishery Certificate Statement ▲

The Fishery Certificate Statement may be included in the Fishery Certificate or made an annex to it.

The advantage of a Fishery Certificate Statement or as annex is the ability to update it more frequently, e.g. changes with client certificate sharing agreement details, than the Fishery Certificate; while a Fishery Certificate is a statement of fact, the Fishery Certificate Statement can include more explanation.

The CAB should include all information from the 'MSC Reporting Template' Section 'Eligibility to enter Chain of Custody' into the Fishery Certificate Statement in order to provide sufficient information to CoC holders buying from the UoC.

If a negative determination is made, it should be clear in the Fishery Certificate Statement that fish or fish products are not eligible to enter certified chains of custody.

- · The entities with access to the certificate referred to in this clause should include:
- · Vessels or fleets within the UoA or UoC.
- · Client group members, which may be fishers or other bodies such as processing companies.
- o If the client wishes to make the certificate available to non-fishing client group members at the exclusion of non-client group members, a list of named companies needs to be provided or linked to here.
- · Sales agents with the right to sell product on behalf of the fishery client into certified chains of custody.

<!-- image -->

## G7.24.7.1.e Other limits to eligibility ▲

The Fishery Certificate Statement should detail all exclusions to product eligibility that the client has defined, which could include:

- · Sale through the client group.
- · Product forms (e.g. fish meal) being excluded from eligibility.
- · Trip exclusions (e.g. the trips that go both inside and outside the UoC).
- · Landing processes where eligibility is verified (e.g. verifying catch area or gear).

The Fishery Certificate Statement may also include other information relevant to the first buyer. This could include:

- · Where the CoC starts and from whom certified product can be purchased (e.g. relevant auctions, agents, and/or client group members).
- · How product can be identified as certified when it enters the CoC. This is copied from the fishery assessment report including a description of documents or labels.

## G7.25 Certification decision and certificate issue ▲

A fishery certificate is the formal document that is issued to a fishery client as evidence that a fishery is certified against the MSC Fisheries Standard. The CAB should refer to the certification decisionmaking entity requirements of the GCR and ISO 17065.

## G7.26

UoA(s) that fail or withdraw from assessment ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.26.4.1 Non-binding conditions ▲

The CAB should clearly report in the Client and Peer Review Draft Report (CPRDR) and subsequent assessment reports why conditions are non-binding. If, for any reason, there are score changes that result in the UoA passing after the CPRDR stage, the CAB should follow 7.19.6-7.19.9.

<!-- image -->

## G7.26.7 Reporting ▲

The following are to be provided in full and should not report only on elements revised between the initial and subsequent assessment of the UoA:

- · Announcement Comment Draft Report.
- · Client and Peer Review Draft Report.
- · Public Comment Draft Report.
- · Final Draft Report.
- · Public Certification Report.

<!-- image -->

## G7.27 Extension of scope of fishery certificate (scope extensions) ▲

## Background

This section provides for limited extensions to the scope of a fishery certificate, as requested by an existing fishery client, to include other fishing operations in the same area or an adjacent area. Such extensions may, for example, bring in a gear type or fleet of vessels that also targets the main Principle 1 species but was not included in the original assessment. The process also allows for the movement of a target species from Principle 2 to Principle 1, so that it can be included in the existing certificate. It is provided as an alternative, cost-effective assessment option for fishery clients in cases where a whole new assessment is not needed. In these instances, some form of certificate sharing will often be involved between the original and new fisheries.

<!-- image -->

## G7.27.1.b Confirming the fisheries' eligibility for extension ▲

The MSC default assessment tree identifies 8 assessment 'components':

- · Principle 1 - Target stock outcome (status); target stock management.
- · Principle 2 - In-scope species; ETP or out-of-scope (OOS) species; habitats; ecosystems.
- · Principle 3 - Governance and policy; fishery-specific management.

<!-- image -->

## G7.27.5.b Gap analysis ▲

The individual completing the gap analysis may use Table G8 below to provide justification for the outcome of the gap analysis to determine which assessment components are the same across the proposed UoA and the existing UoC(s).

## Example

The proposed UoA may have the same target stock, management system, and gear but be fishing in a different geographical area and be taking a different mix of ETP/OOS species. If so, ETP/OOS PIs would have to be rescored in the scope extension assessment.

## G7.27.7

## Adding new 'other eligible fishers' ▲

<!-- image -->

Fishery clients sometimes fail to identify all of the possible 'other eligible fishers' who are included in an assessment even though their impacts have been assessed and taken into account when the existing UoA was scored. In this case, the CAB may extend the certificate to these 'other eligible fishers' as long as the team confirms that the impacts were included in the scoring of the existing UoA. In cases where the assessment did not include the other fishers (e.g. it was restricted to only a few of the members of the fishing fleet), this option does not apply, and the scope extension process of Annex PE should be followed to assess the additional impacts in Principle 2.

## G7.29.4.b &amp; 7.29.6.c Verification of information ▲

To assess fisheries against the verification of information criteria, the CAB should create a list of information, information resources, and aspects of the UoA that need to be reviewed in the annual audit. For each item, the CAB should use Table G10 below to determine the likelihood that it will be able to access the required information remotely and that it can confirm veracity of the information.

In determining how fisheries meet the criteria on verification of information, the CAB may consider the type, nature, and complexity of the UoA. UoAs will be at different points on the spectrum, from a very limited ability to a highly advanced ability to provide information remotely. The CAB should use its expert judgement and knowledge of the UoA to determine a surveillance level commensurate with the fishery client's ability to provide the information remotely for verification by the CAB.

Table G10: Assessment of information available to enable the determination of appropriate surveillance

## Example of how to determine surveillance levels

In this example, a fishery has conditions on the following PIs: 1.2.1, 1.2.3, 3.2.3.

| Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Action plan and milestones                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Client commitment and CAB  evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1.2.1   By the fourth annual  surveillance audit, the  client shall provide  information to demonstrate  that there is a robust and  precautionary harvest  strategy in place and  evidence exists that it is  achieving its objectives for  all significant fisheries that  target this stock. | 1. At each annual surveillance  audit, provide updates on  progress the fishery  management agency has  made towards developing a  robust and precautionary  harvest strategy for the stock.  2. By the 4th annual  surveillance audit, the client  will provide evidence of the  robust and precautionary  harvest strategy in place for  the fishery. | 1. The CAB shall be provided  with meeting minutes and  research papers to assess the  developments.  2. Adoption of harvest strategy  could be checked by  documents (agreements,  research plans, fishery  management plans), letters  from stakeholders, as well as  impact assessment of harvest  strategy. |
| 1.2.3  Develop and implement a  sampling program of full  catch recording across a  suitable sample of the  fleet.                                                                                                                                                                              | Year 1  1. Request scientific institute to  help set up self-sampling  program consistent with  condition requirement.  2. The skippers and crew of  vessels will be trained in how  to perform self-sampling.  3. Results of self-sampling  protocol will be presented  annually in a report.                                                          | Year 1  1. Present the CAB with report  by scientific institute as well as  the self-sampling program  protocol and results.  2. Provide evidence that crew  has been trained - record of  training material, attendance  list to training. Also (raw)  records of self-sampling (from  a sample of vessels).   |
| 3.2.3   A monitoring, control, and  surveillance (MCS) system  has been implemented.  However, sanctions for  non-compliance exist, but  they are not necessarily  consistently applied. The  lack of regular data  collection on vessel  infringements will support  this view.                | Year 1  The coastguard will review  MCS procedures, provide a  plan to ensure effective  enforcement and identify  required resources; records  will also be collated on  infringements and sanctions  before the first audit.  Year 2  The updated MCS procedures  will be implemented in the 2nd                                                      | Year 1  The CAB shall be provided  with minutes of meetings  between the client and the  coastguard as well as a  detailed plan of how MCS  procedures will be tightened  and an overview of increased  monitoring of infringements.  Year 2  Evidence of roll-out of updated  MCS procedures is provided to    |

The above assessment demonstrates that all required information can be provided remotely. Consequently, the CAB would present a detailed justification for each surveillance activity and the number of auditors that will carry out the surveillance as outlined in the following table:

|   Year | Surveillance  activity   | Number of  auditors             | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## G7.29.8.1 Surveillance schedule ▲

The 6-month flexibility either side of the anniversary date allows:

- · Surveillance audits to align with key dates in the fishery management cycle.
- · Surveillance audits to align with the expected delivery of conditions according to the Client Action Plan.
- · The coordination of site visits with the surveillance audits of other nearby MSC fisheries, thereby minimising the inputs required from management agencies and stakeholders.

This flexibility means that some or all surveillance audits will not be held on the anniversary date of the certificate.

Regardless of revised surveillance audit timings, 4 surveillance audits are to be conducted before the expiry date of the existing certificate, see 7.29.9.

## G7.29.15.a.iv Changes to traceability ▲

Changes that affect traceability and the ability to segregate MSC from non-MSC product may be to:

- · The systems or tools used for traceability, and/or
- · The UoC(s).

The team should include this response and the review of the traceability change (as per 7.29.15.e.v) within the surveillance audit report as per the template.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.16.1.b 'Behind target' ▲

'Behind target' means that actions, outcomes, expected results, or milestones have fallen behind the timeframes specified when setting the condition.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.16.1.b.i Remedial action ▲

Remedial action can include the CAB setting new milestones provided these are still expected to achieve the condition within the timeframes identified at the time of setting the condition.

## G7.29.16.2

'Back on target' ▲

<!-- image -->

'Back on target' means meeting the original milestones or revised milestones (described in 7.29.16.1.b.i) within 12 months of falling behind.

## G7.29.16.2.c &amp; G7.29.16.4.c Full assessment after suspension related to conditions ▲

The MSC's intent is that if a fishery client has failed to achieve a condition by its deadline, the fishery client is not allowed to enter the same UoCs, or entities in the UoC(s), into (re)assessment under either the same or an alternative name or alias where the effective intent is to extend the duration of the condition into a new certification period.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.23 Completing the audit ▲

In line with ISO 17065 and ISO 19011 requirements, the CAB is required to have an audit plan established with clear timeframes. The plan is required to justify when evidence-gathering will take place in an audit process. During both on-site and off-site audits, the end of the evidence-gathering stage should be used as the start day for surveillance report submission timelines.

<!-- image -->

## G7.30 Expedited audits ▲

## G7.30.1 New information ▲

Examples of 'changes to the circumstances of the UoA and/or new information' that may require completion of an expedited audit include:

- · Major changes in management.
- · New information describing a major impact of the UoA.

However, as the FCP states, there must be good reason to think that these are actual material differences, and not a likely temporary change in indicated status; such a change might arise, for example, from the introduction of a new and not yet validated stock assessment model.

The MSC's intent is that if the CAB is uncertain whether changes to circumstances or new information will cause any of the triggers as defined in 7.30.1.a-c, the CAB should:

- · Take a precautionary approach.
- · Complete an Expedited Audit to assess the impact.

<!-- image -->

## G7.30.10 Expedited audits during full and initial assessment or scope extension ▲

The MSC's intent for expedited audits during full assessments is as follows:

- · Expedited audits are triggered at any point after the information cut-off date.

- · Expedited audits are conducted alongside the assessment process.
- · The determination and certificate decision are based on the information that was available up until the information cut-off date (7.15.1.1).
- · If the draft determination is to certify a UoA but the expedited audit results in the rescoring of an individual PI to less than 60 or a Principle score to less than 80, the determination and certificate decision is not affected (i.e. the certificate is issued). However, the result of the expedited audit means that the certificate is suspended immediately. The expedited audit report and the 'MSC Notice of Suspension Template' are published at the same time as the Public Certification Report.
- · The suspension is immediate, with no 30-day notice period.

## G7.30.12 Expedited audit during a reassessment ▲

If the reassessment is against a new version of the MSC Fisheries Standard, it is possible that an expedited audit is triggered for the existing certificate and not the reassessment, or vice versa, due to difference in PISGs.

When an expedited audit is triggered as per 7.30.1 for both the existing certificate and the reassessment, the MSC does not expect the CAB to conduct 2 separate expedited audits. Therefore, the CAB may:

- · Conduct the expedited audit activities so that all relevant information and PISGs are considered at the same time.
- · Publish a single expedited audit report.

However, if there are differences in the Performance Indicator Scoring Guideposts due to a new version of the MSC Fisheries Standard being used for the reassessment, the CAB will need to:

- · Record the results separately.
- · Clearly identify the results that are relevant to the existing certificate and the reassessment.

When an expedited audit is triggered for both the existing certificate and the reassessment, the expedited audit report is published within 60 days of announcing the expedited audit regardless of when the Public Certification Report is published. This allows the supply chain to prepare for the suspension of the UoC once the reassessment is complete.

## G7.31 Reassessment ▲

## G7.31.5.2 Open conditions at reassessment ▲

There are a number of scenarios under which a UoA could enter reassessment with an open condition(s):

- · The condition is being carried over into the next certificate (see G7.31.5.2.a).
- · The condition deadline is the 4th-year surveillance audit and the 4th surveillance audit has not been conducted at the time of announcing the reassessment and publishing the Announcement Comment Draft Report.
- · The condition deadline is in the 5th year.

<!-- image -->

## G7.31.5.2.a Carrying over conditions ▲

Conditions can be carried over in the following scenarios:

- · Exceptional circumstances apply, as per 7.16.6.
- · The condition was set during a surveillance audit during the most recent certificate cycle.

- · The condition was set during a scope extension assessment during the most recent certificate cycle.
- · The condition was set during an expedited audit during the most recent certificate cycle.
- · The condition was set on PI 1.2.1 SI (a). The stock is at or above BMSY and 'available' harvest control rules (HCRs) are in place (the MSC Fisheries Standard Table SA5 and the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard GSA2.5).

<!-- image -->

## G7.31.6 Related conditions ▲

A related condition is a condition:

- · That was closed during the previous certification period, and
- · Where a new condition on the same PI or SI is set at the subsequent assessment or audit, or
- · That involves the same scoring element or topic (e.g. collecting information on P2 species).

The scenarios under which a related condition is opened could include:

- · A change in the assessment tree that has led to an increase in the performance required at the SG80 level (i.e. the sustainability bar has been raised).
- · There has been a change in status since the condition was closed; this would only be applicable for outcomes PIs.
- · The scoring element now falls under a different component. For example, in the previous assessment a species was designated as an in-scope species but is now designated as an ETP/OOS species.

## G7.31.13 Reduced reassessment ▲

Remote team members can provide support to the on-site team member. However, the CAB should determine how the team can best make use of on-site and remote team member(s) during the reduced reassessment.

The reduced reassessment may benefit from remote team member(s) participating in stakeholder consultations conducted at the site visit by the on-site team member. This should be considered and arranged as part of the planning process. There may be some stakeholder consultation meetings where it is not necessary for the remote team member(s) to participate remotely. If so, their time could be used more effectively for other reduced reassessment activities.

The team member selected to conduct the site visit (i.e. the on-site team member) should be the person most relevant to the content of the stakeholder interviews and information gathering that is needed to assess the UoA. For example, if the UoA had conditions on Principle 2 components, then the Principle 2 expert should be the on-site team member. The Team Leader will provide oversight of the reduced reassessment process.

## G7.32 Assessing UoCs that expire after the transition deadline against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 ▲

These requirements allow for CABs to assess existing UoCs, as requested by the fishery client, against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 before the transition deadline of 1 November 2028.

## Annex GPB Harmonisation of overlapping Units of Assessment - Guidance

<!-- image -->

## GPB1 Background ▲

The general principle in Annex PB is that any new assessment or audit within a harmonised group of overlapping fisheries should take into consideration the conclusions of any previous assessment or audit such that harmonisation is maintained over time.

When undergoing harmonisation efforts, clients should be encouraged to collaborate where possible (e.g. via certificate sharing), thereby minimising the number of overlapping assessments that require harmonisation. The MSC accepts that this is sometimes not possible, and that the uncertainties associated with harmonisation can sometimes be difficult for CABs and clients to plan for and manage.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.2.1 Overlapping Units of Assessment ▲

CABs may use the MSC's Harmonisation Database to identify overlapping Units of Assessment (UoAs).

Harmonisation is not necessary in assessments of UoAs that use similar gears or management approaches but operate in clearly different geographical areas.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.2.3 Reporting overlapping UoAs ▲

These clauses are to ensure there is full transparency over what will need to be harmonised, whether that involves adopting previous scores or whether there is a need to re-open harmonisation discussions because PB1.4.1.1 has been triggered.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.3.1 Harmonised assessment outcomes ▲

In cases where there are 2 Units of Certification (UoC) from the same UoA, harmonisation should be expected to result in identical scores and conditions unless there is a very clear explanation of the different practices adopted by the 2 UoCs that justifies their different scores.

The MSC's intent is that a part of a UoA that simply decides for commercial or other reasons to have a separate certificate should not be allowed to have different scoring from other members of the same fleet. The MSC seeks to avoid a situation, particularly in Principle 2, in which a UoA in receipt of conditions is able to split itself into several small fisheries and avoid conditions or avoid the requirements to deal with cumulative Principle 2 issues, simply because the impacts of the UoAs are much smaller.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.3.1.a Consistent scoring and rationales ▲

The MSC's intent is that overlapping UoAs have the same level of performance (i.e. the overall result of the relevant PI scoring is either a pass or a fail for overlapping fisheries).

Teams are not required to draft a single harmonised rationale for each relevant PI; scoring rationales may be drafted independently by each team. The rationales presented should, however, lead logically to the harmonised scores that are agreed between the teams (i.e. which Scoring Issue (SI) is met at each Scoring Guidepost level and for each scoring element). The teams should use largely similar arguments and logic for the harmonised scoring rationales.

Having consistent outcomes does not mean the scores need to be exactly the same between different teams, so long as any conditions are generated by the same SIs and scoring elements within harmonised PIs, and the same outcome (pass/fail) is achieved. Given this constraint, and the rules applied in scoring (Section 7.15), it should be rare to find a situation where the scores are not exactly

the same (an example would be where P2 species are only partly overlapping such that some species are harmonised, while others are not, such that the overall scores for the PIs may then differ).

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.3.1.b Consistent conditions and milestones ▲

The MSC's intent is that conditions are set on the same PIs, relating to the same SIs and scoring elements, as appropriate. There may be occasions when different conditions are justified, but they will be rare, and based only on 3 aspects:

- 1. Differences in requirements from different versions of the default trees.
- 2. Changes to management or status that have occurred since the original assessment.
- 3. Differences in actual performance of the fisheries.

Teams should consider the certificate lengths of overlapping UoAs. Teams should be precautionary such that the earliest date for closing a particular condition in 1 (or more) of the overlapping fisheries should apply to all overlapping UoAs.

## GPB1.3.2 Exceptional circumstances ▲

An example of an exceptional circumstance in the context of harmonisation relates to P1 when there are 2 countries that share a stock but their methods of monitoring UoA removals are different, causing a demonstrable difference in the fisheries with regard to the scoring and rationales for PI 1.2.3 SI (b).

Exceptional circumstances also apply where endangered, threatened, or protected (ETP) or out-ofscope (OOS) species are nationally listed in one country but not another, as per PB1.3.1.3.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.4 Annual harmonisation ▲

The MSC's intent is that harmonisation of assessments of overlapping UoAs takes place once a year and the harmonised assessment outcomes are subsequently applied to all UoAs, regardless of whether they are subject to initial assessment, reassessment, scope extension assessment, transition assessment, or surveillance audit. The CABs of the UoAs subject to harmonisation should collectively and collaboratively determine the timing of annual harmonisation activities and organise harmonisation activities accordingly. CABs should consider the timing of management advice and surveillance audit schedules when organising annual harmonisation activities.

## Example

Management advice for stock A is released in April every year. There are 4 UoAs that include stock A as the P1 target stock. The surveillance audits for the 4 UoAs are scheduled to take place between July and October. The CABs may decide to hold the harmonisation activities in May, once the stock management advice has been released. The CABs may decide to bring forward the surveillance audits (as per 7.29.8.1) so that the harmonisation activities take place during the surveillance audit and the harmonised assessment outcomes can be incorporated into the Surveillance Reports immediately. Alternatively, the CABs may decide to announce the surveillance audits soon after the harmonisation activities have concluded so that the harmonised assessment outcomes can be incorporated into the Surveillance Reports as soon as possible.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.4.1.1 New information ▲

The MSC's intent is that harmonisation is not triggered by teams who have a difference of opinion based on the same information.

## GPB1.5.1 Discussion of overlapping UoA by teams▲

Under PB1.5.1, nothing precludes the harmonisation discussion from being mediated. It is expected that at the end of the harmonisation discussion, teams will have harmonised assessment outcomes.

## GPB1.5.1.b-c

Harmonisation of scores and conditions when evaluating cumulative impacts of MSC UoAs in PI 2.1.1 and PI 2.3.2 ▲

Discussions of cumulative impacts should be considered as per the requirements in PB1.4.

Cumulative impacts for more sensitive habitats are dealt with under management requirements and the MSC expects that precautionary avoidance of the cumulative impact should be implemented rapidly. For instance, it could be the case that a precautionary management measure implemented by a newly certified fishery is the designation and closure of new areas of more sensitive habitat. The already certified fishery should consider these closed areas at its next surveillance audit.

The terms of an existing condition for currently certified fisheries might also change with the arrival of newly certified fisheries triggering the cumulative impact requirements, particularly for more sensitive habitats. This would likely be the case when the cumulative impact has increased and when differing partial strategies have not aligned. In such cases, the harmonisation of milestones to achieve a demonstrably effective strategy at SG80 (for PI 2.1.1) or to provide evidence that more sensitive habitats are being protected by all MSC UoAs at SG80 (for PI 2.3.2) might then also be altered.

## GPC1.2-4 Fishery team qualifications ▲

The qualification requirements for fishery team leaders, members and the team overall (Tables PC1, PC2 and PC3) each require at least 3 years' experience in different aspects of fisheries science and management. Experience that may be counted towards the 3-year requirement includes:

- · Experience working on MSC assessments (e.g. as part of a team on a previous fishery assessment).
- · Relevant research experience, including that gained during higher-level research degrees (e.g. a PhD or a Masters by thesis).However, the CAB should not include lower-level research (e.g. during a Masters by coursework with a short summer project) or undergraduate training.

The CAB should note the additional ISO19011 training requirements for team leaders in the personnel requirements of the GCR.

## 1 Fish stock assessment ▲

Where 3 years' or more experience is stated, the '3 years' refers to an individual team member needing to have 3 years' experience. The experience cannot be the accumulated experience of different team members (e.g. 1+2 years).

## 2 Fish stock biology/ecology ▲

<!-- image -->

For a team member to comply with this requirement, 'similar biology' in this context means that where the target species is:

- · A demersal fish species, experience with other demersal fish species qualifies.
- · A pelagic fish species, experience with other pelagic fish species qualifies.
- · A crustacean species, experience with other crustacean species qualifies.
- · A mollusc species, experience with other mollusc species qualifies.

Similarly, for any other taxon.

## 5 Current knowledge of the country, language, and local fishery context ▲

'Common language' means knowledge of a language that is spoken by clients and stakeholders. The intent of the requirement is to ensure that information can be clearly exchanged between the team, client, and stakeholders, and understood by most parties. For example, 'the common language' in Indonesia could be Bahasa, and in African countries it could be English, French, or Portuguese.

A 'relevant fishery' in this context means where the scale of the fishery, the stock assessment techniques, and management approaches are similar to those in the fishery under assessment. For example, if the fishery under assessment is a small-scale operation with limited quantitative information and informal management systems, then 'relevant fisheries' would also have these characteristics. Similarly, if the fishery under assessment is large scale or industrial with fully quantitative stock assessment approaches and related management systems (such as harvest control rules related to input/output measures) then 'relevant fisheries' would also have these characteristics.

## Annex GPD Scope extensions

## GPD1.1.2 ▲

Annex PD outlines the minimum assessment requirements necessary for a scope extension from an already certified fishery to another fishery. There may be cases where additional assessment steps or evaluations are necessary to ensure that the entire assessment of the fishery across all 3 Principles continues to be accurate when additional stocks are added to Principle 1.

## GPD1.2 Assessment process

## GPD1.2.2.1.a Gap analysis ▲

The CAB may use Table G8 to describe the outcome of the gap analysis.

## GPD1.2.4.3.b Considerations for rescoring of Principle 2 species ▲

In cases where there are a number of stocks identified as main in-scope in a certified fishery, assessing 1 or more of these against Principle 1 instead will mean that they are removed as scoring elements from Principle 2 in-scope species.

The remaining scoring elements in Principle 2 in-scope species should then be rescored according to Section 7.15. This does not require a Principle 2 expert.

If the new Principle 2 score causes a failure of the fishery due to the reallocation of Principle 2 species to Principle 1, the CAB may choose to discontinue the scope extension process for 1 or more stocks.

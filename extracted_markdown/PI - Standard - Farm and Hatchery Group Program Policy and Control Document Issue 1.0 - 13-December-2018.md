## Section A - Introductions and Definitions

## 1.0 Definitions

Group A  collection  of  facilities  organized  for  the  sake  of  a  collective  certification  process,  that  have implemented  a  shared  Quality  Management  System  (QMS),  and  which  share  a  common  sponsor  (or common owner/legal entity), who appoints a Facility Group Manager (FGM) to manage the certification process of the Group. Groups are not limited by size, tonnage, or distance from each other (provided that the distances do not present a barrier to effective management and enforcement of the requirements of the  program).  All  Groups  must  share  similar  production  methods  (marine  cages,  raceways  etc.),  and Hatcheries and Farms are not allowed to be included in the same Group. Groups must be composed of at least six, but not more than fifty member facilities

## 2.0 Introduction to GSA Standards

The  GSA  standards  are  achievable,  science-based,  and  continuously  improved  global  performance standards for the aquaculture supply chain that assure healthful foods produced through environmentally and  socially  responsible  means.  They  are  designed  to  assist  program  applicants  in  performing  selfassessments of the environmental and social impacts, and food safety controls of their facilities, and to lead to third-party certification of compliance, thereby eliminating the most significant negative impacts.

For more information, please visit www.bapcertification.org.

## Section B - Group Program Summary

## 1.0 Group Program Summary

The BAP Group Program is designed to accommodate all types of Farms/Hatcheries, regardless of size, species  or  culture  methods,  that  can  meet  the  eligibility  and  operational  requirements  for  Group certification. The requirements for Group (as outlined in this document) entail establishment of an effective Group entity and strict operational and managerial controls at both the Group and individual member-site level.  When facilities can demonstrate compliance with Group requirements, it allows BAP to accept a reduction in the number of onsite audits while preserving the integrity of the BAP scheme.

The Group management controls must be robust enough to instill a high degree of confidence during each phase of the audit, that compliance to all BAP requirements has been well established. Significant shortcomings during the certification audit, whether at Group management or member-site level in any phase of the audit will raise non-conformities against the entire Group entity/management. This is likely to result in suspension  of  the  entire  Group  and  ineligibility  for  certification  unless  all  issues  are  corrected  in accordance with the rules of the program.

Throughout this document, Farms/Hatcheries will be referred to as 'facilities', 'sites' or Group 'members'. Also,  references  to  the  'GSA  Standard,'  refer  to  the  applicable  Farm/Hatchery  standard  whose  scope covers all of the member sites.

The objective of the BAP Group Program is to specify the eligibility requirements, certification procedures and audit criteria to achieve certification to the applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery standard, as conducted by a BAP approved, ISO accredited, independent Certification Body (CB). The GSA Standards against which each facility must comply does not change with Group certification. They are the same standards against which individual Farms/Hatcheries must comply. The difference is that facilities under the Group Program outlined in this document must comply with additional requirements to be a legitimate, properly-functioning 'Group.'

Essential to the Group Program is the requirement for a centralized, Group Management System with strong controls and oversight over the member sites. The system of controls is commonly referred to as the internal Quality Management System (QMS). Compliance is ensured through rigorous application of the QMS and related BAP Group requirements throughout all member sites of the Group. Because of this common QMS system, the Group scheme assumes that not all member sites of the Group need to be audited by an external CB auditor annually. It cannot be overstated the importance of the QMS and its role in maintaining consistent adherence to the BAP requirements within the Group. Likewise, there needs to be recognition of the management resources required for develop, implement, and maintain the QMS and all related components, including the internal audit requirement.

The Group approach requires audits at various levels, summarized in the table below:

## Group Audit Steps

Note:  For  the  BAP  Group  Program  there  are  a  total  of  5  audit steps.  These 5 audit steps are common to all Group schemes

- 1. The Group's Own Internal Audits:
- a. Internal Group QMS and related systems audit
- b. Internal member site audits
- 2. External (CB) Audits of the Group:
- a. Phase I: CB QMS audit (remote desk audit)
- b. Phase II: CB on site audit of Facility Group Manager office
- c. Phase III: CB on site audit of selected member facilities

Some advantages of the Group Program are:

- · Provides for the effective self-governance of the Group with limited external oversight through third party audits.
- · Where compliance is demonstrated, it reduces the number of individual facilities that must be 3 rd party inspected annually for certification, and thereby reduces audit time and costs.
- · Allows multiple sites to be certified at once, provided that the entire Group is in compliance.

There are however significant pre-requisite requirements and considerations for an effective Group Program and for Group applicants:

- · Substantial  applicant  administrative  effort  to  develop,  implement  and  effectively  manage  the Group (if such systems are not already in place).
- · Knowledge of the relevant GSA standard and Group requirements by all member sites.
- · Training of the Facility Group Manager (FGM) and the Group's internal facility auditors to properly enforce and oversee 100% member-site compliance.
- · All members of the Group shall remain in compliance to achieve initial certification and to avoid suspension of certification during subsequent re-certification audits.
- · Group entity shall provide sufficient resources to comply with the GSA standards.
- · The FGM shall properly enforce and oversee member compliance, overall operation of the QMS system and proper conduct of internal site audits for 100% of the member-sites.

## Section C - Certification Body Requirements

## 1.0 Purpose and Procedure

This section describes the requirements that must be adhered to for Certification Bodies (CBs) to:

- · accept a Group audit assignment from the BAP.
- · conduct a Group audit from beginning to end for all new/renewal applications using the following documents:
- · Farm and Hatchery Group Program

Plus, the appropriate GSA Standard for the facilities applying:

- · Farm Standard
- · Mollusk Farms
- · Salmon Farms
- · Finfish, Crustacean and Mollusk Hatcheries &amp; Nurseries

Scope: The Group Program covers any facilities which qualify for BAP Certification through one of the above-mentioned GSA Standards. The Certification Body must be approved by BAP and must be in the accreditation as a minimum in the accreditation extension process with their Accreditation Board.

Aside from qualifying under a GSA Standard, any applicant who wishes to certify multiple facilities under the Group Standard must comply with the additional clauses covered under the Group Standard itself to be eligible for certification.

Method: Upon receipt of an opportunity to audit against the Group Standard from the BAP, CBs must assess whether  they  have  the  capabilities  to  undertake  this  audit  type.  All  BAP  CB's  must  meet  eligibility requirements defined in BAP's CB Requirements Document. CB-assigned auditors must also meet BAP's

Group auditor qualifications to be eligible to audit against the Group Standard. These additional qualities require the auditor to meet the following criteria (in addition to being a certified BAP auditor):

- · Be  an  active  'senior'  auditor  in  the  Standard  Type  the  Group  will  be  audited  against.  The requirements for a BAP Senior auditor can be found in the CB Requirements Document.
- · Must participate in, and pass, an official BAP Auditor Training Course for Category 7 - Group and hold a valid certificate from the BAP program.

If the CB does not have auditors that meet the minimum qualifications to conduct the Group Audit, the audit must officially be rejected by the Certification Body, and this decision must be communicated to the BAP Operations Manager.

If the CB determines they meet the minimum requirements to conduct this type of audit they shall review the application for completeness, accuracy and that the facilities applying for Group fall within the scope of the Group Document and the applicable GSA Farm and/or Hatchery standard type.

- · All Group Applications are initially vetted by BAP Management to determine their eligibility for the Group Program before being assigned to a CB. This proposal for audit is put forward by BAP to the Certification  Body,  but  it  shall  be  the  Certification  Bodies'  responsibility  to  validate  the  Group Application. Any proposed Groups that do not meet approval by the Certification Body shall be rejected and applications returned to BAP for reconsideration.

Arranging Audits: The CB shall select an eligible auditor from their list of approved auditors that meet the requirements to conduct a Group audit as detailed above. The CB shall be responsible for conducting any pre-audit checks by contacting the applicant directly to determine the readiness for audit and agree upon a mutually agreeable date for the audit. The audit date shall be confirmed along with a site audit schedule as outlined in the Group Standard Document. Written confirmation of the audit schedule shall be sent to the applicant. The CB shall forward an authorization to audit and a site audit schedule, to the Facility Group Manager listed in the application.

If the CB determines that the results of the pre-audit check is not satisfactory the CB shall contact the BAP CB Manager for further instructions and shall not continue with scheduling the audit until BAP determines that the facility is ready.

Audit Procedures: Audits shall be conducted using the criteria set out in the following documents:

- · Farm and Hatchery Group Program - This document is the Standard to which the auditor assesses the farm or hatchery Group's compliance with the BAP Group Program. The auditor shall ensure that the applicant complies with these clauses to gain a certificate of approval. The Group Audit shall be:
- · Conducted in three distinct  phases  as  outlined  in  the  BAP  Farm  and  Hatchery  Group  Program Document.
- · The  applicable  GSA  farm  or  hatchery  standard  for  the  facility  types.  -  When  conducting  the sampling of on-site facility audits (as mandated by the Farm and Hatchery Group Program) the auditor  shall  use  the  appropriate  Group  checklist,  provided  by  BAP,  for  the  facility  type  being audited.
- · BAP CB Requirements - This document covers all requirements of the CB for audit procedures as outlined under the section entitled 'The Evaluation Process.'
- · Certification Bodies BAP Process Document -The CB shall ensure that their own internal process document complies with BAP requirements and have records to demonstrate this.

In the case of Group, the length of the audit shall be proposed by the BAP Operations Manager and agreed by  the  CB  in  accordance  with  Farm  and  Hatchery  Group  document  guidelines  and  the  minimum requirements for on-site facility audit durations as noted in the CB Requirements Document.

The auditor shall use only the Group Checklist supplied by BAP to the CB to complete their audit report for the applicable facility types.

Audit Frequency: The Group Program shall be an annual audit in all cases except for the Salmon Standard which shall have a two-year certificate with a surveillance audit as described in the Salmon Surveillance Audit Annex for the Group Program.

Preparation for Certification: Before a certificate of compliance is awarded the CB shall carry out a review of the audit reports to ensure that all requirements in the Group Program have been met and that all site audits conducted against one of the GSA Standards are complete. All non-conformities must be closed according to BAP and CB guidance documents before a certificate can be awarded.

Once complete, CBs shall send to the BAP Program a complete Audit package that includes the following items:

- · Complete Audit Report.
- · Non-conformity summary and corrective action sheet.
- · Any applicable tests that were conducted as mandated by the Group Program Document or a GSA Standard itself.
- · A signed and completed certificate that complies with the Certificate Content section of the CB Requirements Document.

## 1.5 Size and Production Methods of Member Facilities

- 1.5.1 There  is  no  size  limitation  for  member  facilities  based  on  either  the  tonnage  produced  or  the physical size of the facility or individual production units. However, member facilities are required to use similar production practices as described in the GSA Farm/Hatchery Standards (land-based extensive/semi-intensive/intensive flow-through systems, land-based intensive water-reuse systems, cages in various types of water bodies, etc.). For example, a Farm/Hatchery Group could not consist of a mixture of land-based pond operations and marine farm cages.  An exception to this rule may be made, at BAP's sole discretion, for 'multi-phase' hatchery operations that operate multiple styles of facilities as part of their breeding process - e.g., cages for juvenile and adult animals for broodstock production, land-based raceways or tanks for broodstock maturation and spawning, egg hatching, and nursing of juvenile stages.

## 1.6 Number of Member Sites Per Group, and Their Proximity

- 1.6.1 The minimum number of members in a single Group is 6 unless otherwise approved in writing by BAP.  Special consideration concerning these limits in size may be allowed on a case-by-case basis by the BAP when arrangements have been made by a sponsoring organization for simultaneous certification of multiple Groups of facilities of different types (Farms and Hatcheries), or of multiple Groups of facilities of the same type within different regions of the same country.  See Section 4.8 for specific instructions concerning number of Phase III site audits to be done in such cases.
- 1.6.2 The maximum number of members in a single Group is 50, but in exceptional cases may be higher, assuming that a careful risk assessment has been completed and has been approved in writing by BAP.
- 1.6.3 The Group's members shall be in the same geographical region. In cases where more remote sites have been included in a Group, a risk assessment / justification must be presented to BAP for approval in writing at the time of application. A Group must normally be limited to the same region, bay system, etc. as applicable.
- 1.6.4 The Group entity shall carefully consider the number of member sites, their locations and how spread-out they are, and the impact of these factors on the Group's ability to manage and enforce requirements over all members when forming the Group. The Group entity shall have a documented risk  assessment/justification  that  explains  how  these  factors  were  considered  in  forming  the Group, and how proper control and oversight at each site is ensured.

## Notes - on the importance of determining the Group size and member locations:

- a. Every member site shall be able to be readily accessed and be fully and properly managed for the Group scheme to work. If the Group is so large that proper management, communication, and coordination are not possible, the Group risks suspension of their certification.
- b. The distance between members of the Group shall be carefully considered when forming the Group. Facilities that are too far away for the Group entity and FGM and their designees to visit, conduct the internal audits, manage, and ensure compliance will jeopardize the certification for the entire Group. The risk of suspension of the entire Group is significant where Groups are too large or too distant from one another to be effectively managed so that compliance is assured.
- c. Too many member sites that are too far away from each other also increases the time and costs  and  reduces  the  efficiency  for  both  the  FGM  and  internal  audits/auditors,  and  the external (CB) auditors. The added costs of long distances should be carefully considered.
- d. A large, vertically integrated Group, or a Group entity with facilities in many parts of a large country, may wish to consider Grouping by region or defining feature (such as a bay).  In such an instance, each region or bay with several sites would be its own Group, with a separate QMS, FGM, etc.  Multiple, smaller Groups, each with members that are reasonably close to each other managed by a separate FGM may be more manageable compared to one very large, spreadout Group. This may allow for less administrative time/cost, and reduced burden in executing the internal audits at every site every year. It also may reduce the risk of suspension of the entire Group due to too many sites spread across too many regions within a single Group.

## 1.7 Adding and Removing Member Sites

- 1.7.1 The Group FGM or Group entity shall be authorized to manage the process of adding and removing members from the Group, or adding and deleting facilities from the Group Registry.
- 1.7.2 Adding: Initial Certification:  additional members shall not be added to the Group once the Group application has been submitted to BAP.
- 1.7.3 Adding: Recertification:  for certified Groups, additional members shall only be added at the time of the recertification/surveillance application. (Changes/additions to the Group members shall be received by the BAP office no later than two months prior to the external audit date.
- 1.7.4 The Group entity shall ensure that all new member Farm/Hatchery applicants have had an internal audit against the requirements of the applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery standard and the BAP Group requirements  in  this  document  and  all  non-conformities  have  been  properly  corrected/closed before they are accepted as new members by the Group.
- 1.7.5 There shall be clear and unambiguous, documented rules and procedures for the addition of new members to the Group.
- 1.7.6 Removing: Member facilities  can,  and  shall,  be  removed  at  any  time  if  they  show  themselves unable or unwilling to comply with the Group and GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard requirements, and the contractual (or written agreement) provisions of the Group.  The Certification Body and BAP shall be informed immediately by sending an updated registry, details of removed facilities, and the reason for the removal.  (See 'Sanctions and Suspensions' later in this document for further details).
- 1.7.7 Escalation Process for Member Sites: There shall be clear and unambiguous, documented rules and  procedures  for  disciplining  and/or  removing  members  from  the  Group.    These  rules  shall include an escalation process for actions taken, and at what point the member is to be removed from the Group where the member is repeatedly not complying with requirements.  This shall take into consideration, situations such as but not limited to, the member:
- · Is not responding to, or cooperating with, the Group entity, FGM or his/her designee, or the Internal Auditor(s) on any issue.
- · Is not providing the information requested in a timely fashion.
- · Is not cooperating with the need to have an internal audit, and/or continually delaying the process.
- · Is  not  providing  corrective  action  evidence  and  closing  non-conformities  in  a  timely fashion.
- · Has a pattern of excessive non-conformities at either the internal or external (CB audit) level.

## 1.8 Scope of Group Certification - (No Exemptions)

- 1.8.1 BAP Group Certification shall cover all products produced by the Group and its members and no portion of the Groups production or its facilities are exempt from inspection.

## 1.9 Organizational Chart/Document

- 1.9.1 The Applicant shall have in place an organizational chart or document that defines:
- 1.9.1.1  The relationship between the Group entity and each of the sites (wholly owned, partially owned, leased, contracted, etc.).

This would also include situations where there is a fundamental breakdown in the site's programs and systems to the extent that there is a critical overall failure to comply with the applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard or BAP Group Program requirements.
- 3.4.1.2 Major Where there is a substantial failure to meet the requirements of the intent of any clause of the applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard or BAP Group Program.

- 3.4.2.3.1 Critical -  Critical  non-conformities  found  during  internal  audits  of  sites  shall result in IMMEDIATE suspension by the FGM and Group entity, of the site from the  Group.    The  FGM  and/or  his/her  designees  shall  immediately  undertake when a site critical is found, an investigation to determine if the incidence is isolated, or if it may also exist at one or more other member sites.

HOWEVER, neither the FGM, nor any of the Internal  Auditors,  shall  answer  auditor  questions  on  behalf  of  the  member  site,  or  otherwise interfere with the audit and discussion with member site staff.  (The FGM shall only answer auditor questions during the member site audit as they specifically relate to areas that the FGM is directly responsible for).
- 4.1.4 All Group sites named in the application shall be in operation at the time of both the initial and annual recertification, CB site audits. This means ongoing cultivation of the species named in the Group application. An exception for this may be considered for sites that engage in regular cycles of fallowing as part of cultivation; however, the number of fallow sites may never exceed 20% of the total number of Farms/Hatcheries in the Group at the time of audit.
- 4.1.5 All Farms forming sub-groups/societies/cooperatives named in the application, treated as the unit of certification under Section 1.2.2.1, shall be in operation at the time of both the initial and annual recertification,  CB  site  audits.    An  exception  for  this  may  be  considered  within  such  units  of certification that engage in cycles of low/off-season production as part of cultivation; however, the number of such sites may never exceed 20% of the total number of units of certification in the subgroups/societies/cooperatives at the time of audit.
- 4.1.6 The CB shall confirm during Phase I (remote desk top audit) that the Group has developed a QMS that  includes  all  components  listed  in  this  document  and  has  conducted  the  Group  internal systems audit and all individual site internal audits.  Copies of these records shall be sent to the CB and BAP upon request via email or suitable alternative digital record for review. The CB shall further confirm that all nonconformities the Group issued during these internal audits were closed to the satisfaction of the Group and in a manner consistent with the processes outlined in this document, by obtaining their non-conformance closure records with a description of the evidence accepted to close. The CB shall complete Phase I prior to proceeding with an on-site visit (Phase II and III).

## 4.2 External (CB) Audit - 5 Elements (CB Guidance)

- 4.2.1 The external audit will consist of five elements:
- · Remote (off-site) desk audit of the QMS and related components as described below (Phase I)
- · On-site audit of FGM office (Phase II), starting with an opening meeting, prior to commencement of the audit
- · On-site facility assessments (Phase III), starting with an opening meeting prior to the commencement of the audit
- · Collection of any necessary samples
- · Closing meeting. The auditor will prepare a list of all non-conformities to be signed and left with the facility during the closing meeting.

## 4.3 External (CB) Audit (CB Guidance)- Audit Timing, and the Three Phases:  The CB Group audit process consists of three phases.  (Audit frequency annually).

The Certification Body shall be mindful that the audit consists of systems review and physical inspection of the sites and site practices. Time allocation during the audit shall provide sufficient and proportionate time  for  each  activity  to  be  carried  out  properly  and  fully.    Where  appropriate,  additional  time  shall  be allowed when the Auditor is required to carry out further investigation.

The  audit  phases  and  typical  duration  are  described  below.    Note  that  the  durations  may  increase  or decrease,  depending  upon  how  efficient  the  Group  is  in  its  organization  and  ability  to  demonstrate compliance at each phase

As  described  previously,  the  success  of  the  Group  concept  is  dependent  on  the  proper  management, documentation and controls on the part of the Group and its members.

- 4.3.1 Phase I : Audit of Certain QMS Components. There shall be an initial audit of the QMS system and documentary components prior to proceeding with the other phases.  Documents to be reviewed by the auditor at Phase I are:
- · the registry of member sites in accordance with 1.4.2
- · the QMS manual in accordance with 2.4.1-2.4.4
- · the  internal  audit  reports  (the  QMS  internal  audit  and  each  member  site  internal  audit)  in accordance with all of Sections 3.1-3.3.
- · The non-conformities for each internal audit, and the corrective action evidence and actions taken by the Group to correct them in accordance with all of Sections 3.4 - 3.6.

(See 1.10. for translation requirements, where applicable).

Typically, this is one day audit. It shall be performed remotely by the CB auditor upon timely sending of all of these components electronically to the CB.  This phase is also often called a 'remote, or off-site, desk audit'. This portion is performed remotely for two reasons:

- A. To save time and cost for the applicant
- B. To  avoid  proceeding  with  Phase  II  and  III  and  incurring  time  and  travel  costs  where  the applicant has clearly demonstrated at Phase I, they are not ready to proceed and are not in compliance with the Group Program or applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard requirements. Where this is the case, the process will stop and/or the Group may be sanctioned or suspended at this phase.  (See 4.7).
- 4.3.2 Phase II: Facility Group Manager (FGM) and Internal Systems Audit. There shall be an audit of the systems, management, and responsibilities of the overall Group, the FGM, and of the records and procedures of the member Farms/Hatcheries, on site at the FGM office.

Typically,  this  phase  of  the  audit  takes  one-half  to  one  day  to  complete.    It  is  intended  to  cover  the documents that were not reviewed at Phase I, and to review documents that should be maintained centrally where they and the procedures and records are common to all member sites.  This phase also includes additional assessment of the FGM's overall effectiveness in managing the Group program.

Notes: For effective management of the support documents that will be reviewed during Phase II of the external  audit,  applicants  are  strongly  encouraged  to  maintain  all  relevant  documents  in  an  easily accessible fashion, at a central location, for efficient review.

Examples  of  other  Group  and  QMS  procedures  and  supporting  documents  to  be  maintained,  typically checked at Phase II:

- · Facility permits, licenses, and other legal documents
- · Community correspondence
- · Payroll information
- · Personnel and Site training procedures and records
- · Effluent testing records (if applicable)
- · Sediment/benthic monitoring data (if applicable)
- · Water usage records
- · Raw material purchases and their sources.  (Such as stocking material, health certificates, etc.)
- · Feed purchases, sources, FCR and FIFO calculations for Farms/Hatcheries
- · Complaint and resolution files.
- · Contracts or written agreements with member sites (for those that are not owned by the Group entity
- · FGM qualifications
- · List of Internal Auditors and their qualifications
- · Management review minutes, results and follow up actions
- · Documentary Control Procedures
- · Group entity decision-making committee members
- · Wildlife Interaction Plans
- · Health Management Plans
- · Escape prevention procedures and incidence records
- · Biosecurity procedures
- · All internal audit reports and corrective action evidence in the event that further examination of these, after Phase I, is requested by the CB auditor.
- 4 .3.3 Phase III: Member Site Audits: A select number (see 4.8 below) of member sites shall be audited at  the  initial  audit  phase,  and  thereafter  annually  for  recertification.  Member  site  audits  are expected to take one-half to one day per site location.

Notes: The above time frames are only a guide. There may be cases where due to distances involved, a large number of facilities in the Group, or the complexity of the audits and systems, the number of days may  be  increased.  Likewise,  the  number  of  days  may  be  shortened  in  some  cases,  particularly  if Farms/Hatcheries are very small and near to one another.

The time frames for site audits anticipate that many of the common elements and data will have already been reviewed at Phase I and Phase II.  (For example, there are many records for each site that would be expected to be maintained at or in a database at the FGM's office.  Such as effluent data, permits, feeding records,  traceability  records,  etc.).    Therefore,  at  the  site  level  the  auditor  is  typically  focused  only  on practices or issues that are unique to that site, and on verification at site level that what was observed at Phase I and Phase II accurately reflects site practices and data.

## 4.4 Audit Reporting by the CB's Auditor (CB Guidance)

4.4.1 The external (CB) auditor shall use the authorized BAP Group and applicable Farm/Hatchery standard audit checklists for each of the three phases of the audit. The checklists that shall be used for every audit are:

- 4.4.2 The BAP Group audit checklist for the applicable Farm/Hatchery standard - Phase III
- 4.4.3 The BAP Group Program audit checklist. - Phases I and II, tallies at all 3 phases, and resulting additional non-conformities against the Group, where applicable.
- 4.4.4 A written summary of the non-conformities shall be prepared by the auditor for all 3 phases at the completion of the audit during the closing meeting.  This shall be provided to the management personnel of the Group, including the FGM (where the Group fails the audit at Phase I so that the other Phases do not proceed timely, the results of Phase I are to be provided promptly).
- 4.4.5 The auditor's summary of non-conformities for all phases shall be provided to the CB within 48 hours of completion of all phases. (Or sooner, after completion of each phase, at CB discretion).
- 4.4.6 A formal audit report shall be prepared and submitted to the CB within ten days of completion of all phases (or, sooner after completion of each phase at CB discretion).

## 4.5 Group-Related Non-conformities - and Added Citations Against the Group (CB Guidance)

- 4.5.1 Non-Conformities at Phases I (CB remote desk audit of the Groups QMS), and Phase II (CB audit of the FGM office) are defined as follows:

Group Critical Where there is a critical systems failure on the part of the Group entity to properly implement requirements and to manage and control the Group and its members. Such systems failures indicate the Group's responsibility to ensure all sites conform to BAP requirements have not  been  met  and  conformity  at  all  member  sites  cannot  be  relied  on.  (Examples:  Required elements of the QMS have not been developed or implemented; sites have not been trained in the requirements of the GSA Standard or BAP Group Program; internal audits were not conducted at all listed Group member sites as required, etc.

Where a Group critical is raised, it shall be raised against either the 'Group's QMS and Related Components' section of the audit, or the 'Group's Internal Site Audits' section, as appropriate.

Group Major Where there is a major breakdown or failure to comply with a clause of the Group Program Requirements in either the 'Group's QMS and Related Components' section or in the 'Group's Internal Site Audits' section.   (Examples  would involve deficiencies such as described under 'Critical' above that do not rise to the level of critical but are significant enough to be major.)

Group Minor As defined under 'Major', but that do not rise to that level.   Such as small oversights or  technical  errors  in  documents  or  records,  or  clause  intentions  being  mostly  met  but  not completely.

## 4.5.2 Raising an Additional Critical Against the Group:

Where there are 5 or more Major's raised against the Group during Phase I AND Phase II combined (10, or more, total), there shall be an additional non-conformity = critical = raised against the Group.

(Presence of too many majors indicates systems failures on the part of the Group related to either the  QMS  development  and  implementation,  the  Group's  internal  audits  of  the  QMS,  or  both. Therefore, compliance of the Group and member sites cannot be relied upon).

## 4.6 Site-Related Non-Conformities - And Added Citations Against the Group (CB Guidance)

- 4.6.1 Non-Conformities at Phase III (site audits) are defined as follows:
- · Site Critical - Where there is a critical failure to comply with a legal, social accountability or food safety issue.  Or, a critical failure to comply with one or more fundamental requirements of the applicable  GSA  Standard  or  BAP  Group  Program  to  the  extent  that  it  results  in  a  risk  to  the integrity  of  the  Scheme.    This  would  also  include  situations  where  there  is  a  fundamental breakdown in the site's programs and systems to the extent that there is a critical overall failure to comply with the applicable GSA  Farm/Hatchery Standard or BAP  Group  Program requirements.
- · Site Major -  Where there is a substantial failure to meet the requirements of the intent of any clause of the applicable GSA Standard or BAP Group Program.  But there is no Food Safety risk, issue of legality, fundamental systems failure, or immediate risk to the Integrity of the Scheme.
- · Site  Minor -Where  absolute  compliance  to  the  clause  or  intent  of  the  applicable  GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard or Group Program requirements has not been demonstrated. Typically, minors would be technical deficiencies, small missing elements, small recordkeeping errors, or similar minor matters.
- 4.6.2 Site Critical, Major, and Minor Non-Conformities, and Additional Citations Against the Group:
- 4.6.2.1  Critical non-conformities found at member sites can either be 'site specific' or 'systemic'. Each  classification  has  a  different  ramification  in  terms  of  resulting  nonconformities assessed against the Group.
- · 'Site Specific' - confined to the site only and not indicative of a loss of control at the Group management level
- · ' Systemic' - Indicates a likely failure at the Group management level.
- 4.6.2.2  Site level major and critical non-conformities shall be assessed against the site and Group as follows:
- 4.6.2.2.1 Excessive major non-conformities at multiple sites = Critical against the Group. 'Excessive' is according to the following table:

## 4.7 Certification, Corrective Actions, Sanctions, and Suspension (CB Guidance)

- 4.7.1 Certification  and  Closure  of  Non-conformities: All  non-conformities  raised  during  the  audit (critical,  major,  and  minor)  shall  be  satisfactorily  resolved  before  the  CB  can  issue  the  BAP Certificate.
- 4.7.2 Corrective  Actions  and  Closure  of  Non-Conformities: Proper  closure  of  nonconformities  is accomplished through the Group submitting sufficient objective evidence to the Certification Body that each non-conformity was properly resolved.  Objective evidence shall be submitted, in English, via email or equivalent digital means to the CB and BAP upon request.  Proper objective evidence includes records, revised documents or procedures, test results, pictures, etc.  The evidence shall clearly show that the matter was corrected AND that the root cause was also properly identified and corrected to prevent future re-occurrence.  (Root cause = why did it happen in the first place and how will it be prevented from happening again in the future?)
- 4.7.3 Non-Conformities Raised Against the Group, Corrective Action Time Frames, and Sanctions and Suspensions The entire Group can be suspended at any of the three audit phase steps mentioned previously.  (Where the applicant's obligations under Group program have not been met and/or significant deficiencies are found which risks the integrity of the BAP scheme).  When an entire Group has been suspended, the Group must immediately instruct its members that none of the product remaining in the member facilities is to be considered BAP certified and to STOP claiming BAP certification for any crops they are producing.

## 4.8 Number of Site Audits, Site Selection, and Advance Notice for CB External Audit: (CB Guidance)

4.8.1 Scope - the site audits shall be conducted by the CB auditor against the entire scope of the BAP Group Program and the applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard

4.8.2 Minimum number of Sites - the minimum number of sites selected by the CB shall be the square root of the number of sites in the Group, rounded (up or down), to the nearest whole number, plus one.  In cases where BAP has agreed to allow simultaneous certification of Groups as described in 1.6.1, a sum shall be made of the total number of individual Farm/Hatchery member sites.  The minimum number of sites to be selected for Phase III audits from the total shall be the square root rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, plus one.  Special attention must be given to ensure that a proportional number of each facility type shall be selected for Phase III site audits, considering the total number of each type of facility.  The objective of this proportional representation is to ensure that over a 5 year period, 100% of all individual member sites are subjected to a Phase III external CB audit.  However, not less than 1 site of each facility type must be audited during each annual certification audit.

Example 1 (rounding up): A Group has 15 sites (Farms or Hatcheries)

The square root of 15 = 3.87

Rounding up = 4

4 + 1 = 5

Example 2 (rounding down): A Group has 30 sites (Farms or Hatcheries)

The square root of 30 = 5.48

Rounding down = 5

5 + 1 = 6

Example 3 (rounding down): During simultaneous audits of multiple Groups, in which there is a Farm Group of 24 sites and a Hatchery Group of 6 sites,

The sum of 24 and 6 is 30 and the square root of 30 = 5.47

Rounding down = 5

5 + 1 = 6

In this example, with regards to a 'proportional' selection of sites of each type, the auditor should select 5 farms and 1 hatcheries to audit.

Example 4 (rounding up):  During simultaneous audits of multiple Groups, in which there is a Farm Group of 30 sites and a Hatchery Group of 15 sites (this could also be composed of one Farm Group in one part of a country and a second Farm

Group in a different part of the same country),

The sum of 30 and 15 is 45 and the square root of 45 = 6.71

Rounding up = 7

7 + 1  =  8

## 4.8.3 Site Selection

- · The sites shall be selected at the CBs discretion, based on risk and other factors.

Other  factors  may  include  logistical  concentration,  size  or  production  volume  of  the  sites,  or  similar considerations.

Risk factors that would indicate the need to select a particular site for auditing include:  deficiencies found during the Phase I or Phase II audits; results of the Group's internal audits; inclusion of sites that have not been externally audited in the past; the inclusion of sites added since the last audit; the inclusion of one or more outlier sites (where distance from the rest may indicate challenges in proper oversight by the Group). Other factors not listed here as determined by the CB would also be part of the consideration.

- · Due to the risk factors described above that shall go into site selection determination, the final sites  selected  shall  NOT  be  determined  by  the  CB  until  AFTER  Phase  I  of  the  audit  has  been completed.
- 4.8.4 Increasing the Number of Sites Beyond the Minimum.

The number of sites selected for the CB audit shall be increased, due to higher risk, as follows:

## Risk Factors - Each Applicable Factor = Increase # of Sites Selected by CB by a Minimum of 1

- 1 or more critical non-conformities were raised against 1 or more sites at the last external CB audit
- 4 or more major non-conformities were cited against the Group entity at the last external CB audit

The Group has been suspended, for any period of time within the last 12 months.

- 1 or more critical, or 4 or more major non-conformities found during the current Phase I or Phase II of the audit (against the Group's control systems).
- 1 or more critical, or 4 or more major non-conformities, found during the current CB auditor's individual site (Phase III) audit that indicates a potential system-wide failure. CB's shall have the discretion in such cases to add more sites to be sampled during Phase III of the audit process than were initially selected.

Other serious risk factors at the CBs discretion.

- 4.8.5 Selection and Risk Reporting - The CB shall ensure that the sample selection criteria used, including increasing for risk factors, is properly explained in the final audit report.
- 4.8.6 Site Selection Notice to the Group - the CB shall not inform the Group of the specific sites selected for Phase III of the audit process more than 10 business days prior to their commencement.

## 5.2 Annual Group Certification Renewal (CB Guidance)

- 5.2.1 To recertify, four months prior to the renewal date posted on the BAP website, the BAP office will send the Group entity a new Facility Certification Agreement, the relevant Update Form and any other steps and requirements.  If there are no changes in membership of the member sites in the Group, the Group entity shall complete all of the information and steps sent by BAP no later than two months prior to the recertification date.  Any requests concerning changes in the membership composition of the Group shall be made by the Group entity at the time of re-application.  Such requests shall be received no later than three months prior to the recertification date so that a revised application packet may be prepared. The updated Group Registry of Sites shall be sent at the time of application.
- 5.2.2 During the recertification application process described above, the Applicant shall ensure that the QMS is up-to-date,  all  required  internal  audits  have  been  completed,  all  non-conformities  were resolved, and the management review was conducted as outlined in this document, so that the Group is in compliance with the BAP Group Program and applicable GSA Farm/Hatchery Standard. The Group shall attest to these having been completed and the Group is in compliance at the time of the recertification application.
- 5.2.3 Where the Group is not ready for recertification and cannot attest to compliance as noted in 5.2.2, the Group shall so state, and shall inform BAP when they will be ready.  If they will not be ready in time for the CB to complete the audit process within the required time frame, the Group will be suspended.  If the Group attests to compliance, and the CB finds during Phase I that they are not, such that there are 1 or more critical non-conformities as previously outlined, the Group will be suspended.
- 5.2.4 All Group sites named in the application shall be in operation at the time of the annual CB site audits.  For Farms/Hatcheries this means ongoing cultivation of the species named in the Group application. An exception for this may be considered for sites that engage in regular cycles of fallowing as part of cultivation; however, the number of fallow sites may never exceed 20% of the total number of Farms/Hatcheries in the Group at the time of audit.
- 5.2.5 All Farms forming sub-groups/societies/cooperatives named in the application, treated as the unit of certification under Section 1.2.2.1, shall be in operation at the time of the annual CB site audits. An exception for this may be considered within such units of certification that engage in cycles of low/off season production as part of cultivation, biosecurity measures, or environmental regulatory requirements; however, the number of such sites may never exceed 20% of the total number of units of certification in the sub-groups/societies/cooperatives at the time of audit.
- 5.2.6 BAP reserves the right to send or appoint an auditor to conduct unannounced/limited notice audits of both  the  QMS  and  of  individual  member  sites  at  its  discretion.    The  scope  of  the unannounced/limited  notice  audits  will  be  at  the  discretion  of  the  BAP.    Any  non-conformities raised during an unannounced/limited notice audit shall be closed as per standard BAP rules or the Group risks suspension of its certification.

## Appendix 2.0 - Requirements for BAP Salmonid Marine Cage Farm Group Surveillance Audits

(To be used only during surveillance audits Not Applicable during normal full Salmonid Marine Cage Farm Group audits.  This section and audit approach is not applicable to any other BAP-eligible species.)

## A2.0 Salmonid Marine Cage Farm Group Surveillance Audits

- · A Surveillance Audit is defined as an interim, external BAP Audit conducted by an approved auditor assigned by a third-party Certification Body (CB).
- · BAP will allow Surveillance Audits to be conducted on Salmonid Marine Cage Farms certified under the BAP Farm Group Program, provided that the conditions described in this Appendix are satisfied.
- · For the sake of Salmonid Marine Cage Farm Groups, BAP defines an active site as a farm having fish stocked in cages, and in an active operating mode.  Sites that remain inactive for more than three years must be removed from the Group Registry until such time as there is a decision taken to bring the site back into production.

## A2.0 1 Surveillance Audit Scheduling &amp; Auditor Assignments

- · For salmon farms certifying under the BAP Farm Group Program, BAP has allowed a 2year validity on  the  salmon  farm  certificates,  provided  that  the  Salmon  Farm  Group successfully  passes  an  interim  surveillance  audit  near  the  1-year  anniversary  date following the last successful full Farm Group audit.
- · Such surveillance audits shall preferably be performed by the same auditor that did the initial  Group audit to maintain continuity of the process.  Any exceptions to this rule must be approved by BAP in writing.

## A2.0 2 Remote Audit of Group Phase I Components

A2.0 1.1 Phase 1: An external (CB) remote desk-top review of the Group's annual internal audits of all qualified member sites and of the Group's Quality Management System (QMS) shall be performed as described in the Phase I portion of the BAP Farm and Hatchery Group Program.

- A2.0 1.1.1 The auditor shall confirm that all member sites that meet any 2 out of 3 of the following site qualifications have had an internal audit (as described in Sections 3.3-3.6 of the Farm and Hatchery Group Program) accomplished not more than 365  days prior to the surveillance audit: *
- · The site has fish in the water at the time of the surveillance audit;
- · The site has harvested or transferred out the last of its fish not more than 30 days prior to the surveillance audit;
- · The  site  was  most  recently  stocked  more  than  60  days  prior  to  the surveillance audit.
- * Timing of the internal audits shall ensure that all required internal audits, as defined by the above criteria, are  conducted  and  completed,  with  all  non-conformities  resolved  and  a  site's  membership  status confirmed prior to the surveillance audit. The internal audits, corrective action evidences, and records of

the Review Panel conformity decisions shall be available to the CB Auditor for remote auditing, and upon request to BAP.

## A2.0 3 Phase II Surveillance Audit

- · Phase II Surveillance Audits are to be conducted remotely between the external (CB) auditor, Facility Group Manager (FGM) and other key Group personnel, provided that the CB has determined that onsite Phase II or Phase III Audits are not required per A1.1 4 A1.1 7.
- · The Phase II external (CB) audit is a review of all pertinent documents not covered in Phase  I,  through  a remote interview  process  that  allows  for  online  sharing  of documents.
- · The  Auditor shall focus on interviews of the management  personnel,  on  the performance of the internal audits, corrective actions, timely responses from the site crews, and other key performance parameters to evaluate the continued performance of  the  Group,  including  a  review  of  non-conformities  identified  during  the  previous external Group audit.

## A2.0 4 Changes in Farm Group Site Membership Occurring Prior to Surveillance Audits

A2.0 4.1 To  determine  whether  any  onsite  Phase  II  and  III  audits  are  warranted  as  part  of  a Surveillance Audit, the following evaluation must be made: if at the time of application for a Surveillance Audit the Group Registry of Sites has been changed relative to the registry communicated to the CB and to BAP during the last full Group audit, such that when the total change is summed (i.e. the sum of both additions and subtractions) and added to the original number of sites, then the square root (+1) shall be calculated and the previous audit's square root (+1) subtracted from it.  (See below for an illustration of  this  calculation.) If  the  end  result  of  this  calculation  rounded  up  or  down  to  the nearest whole integer is greater than 0 this will result in a requirement to carry out onsite Phase II and III audits, with the minimum number of Phase III site audits equal to the result.

## Formula for determination of the number of surveillance audits to perform:

N1 = original number of active sites in previous group certification

SQRT1 = √𝑁𝑁 1

rounded up or down to the nearest whole integer

N2 = (# of sites added) + (# sites removed)

rounded up or down to the nearest whole integer

SQRT2 = √ N1 + N2

Number of Phase III audits = (SQRT2 + 1) - (SQRT1 + 1)

Which can also be expressed simply as = SQRT2 - SQRT1

Page 40 of 43

Example 1: 25 sites were initially certified, 10 sites were added and 5 were removed. N1 = 25; SQRT1 = √ 25 = 5 ; N2 = 10 + 5 = 15; SQRT2 = √ 25 + 15 = 6

In this example, the number of onsite Phase III audits would = SQRT2 - SQRT1 = 6 - 5 i.e. = 1

Example 2: 25 sites were initially certified, and 5 sites were added and none were removed. N1 = 25; SQRT1 = √ 25 = 5 ; N2 = 5 + 0 = 5; SQRT2 = √ 25 + 5 = 5

In this example, the number of onsite Phase III audits would = SQRT2 - SQRT1 = 5 - 5 i.e. = 0

- · BAP  must  be  advised  of  any  such  member  site  additions  at  the  time  the  Group  applies  for recertification and concerning any removals at the time the farms are actually removed.
- · Sites chosen for Phase III surveillance audits (if any) are to be selected by the auditor from among all the ' active ' sites in the updated Group Registry.  Farms selected for Phase III audits must be stocked and in operation at the time of the audit inspection.
- · Fallow sites, assuming the Group has definitive plans to re-stock the sites, are to remain and be counted as ' inactive ' members of the Group and will not count as a 'change' for the calculation of the square root formula for Surveillance Audits. Since Fallowing of leases is an integral part of production planning for environmental as well as biosecurity reasons for many regions, BAP will accept in Groups composed of Marine Salmonid Cage Farms, up to 40% Fallow sites at the time of audit.  (As compared to the 20% limit otherwise normally imposed in the BAP Group Program.

## A2.0 5 Review of the Salmon Farm Group production schedule by the external (CB) auditor

A2.0 5.1

Updated production schedule projections for the Group member sites shall be supplied to the auditor along with the internal audits. Copies of these projections shall also be submitted to the BAP.

## A2.0 6 Determination of need for possible onsite Phase II and Phase III audits through risk assessment of the Group's performance since the initial onsite external (CB) Group audit

- · Based on results of Phase I and II remote audits, the auditor will determine if there exists a significant risk that the Group internal management is not performing effectively, and whether adherence to the BAP Farm/Hatchery Group Program and/or the Salmon Farm Standard is at risk. Possible risk factors to consider are described in the Farm/Hatchery Group Program Document section 4.8.4.
- · If risk factors are identified and a decision is reached to proceed to onsite Phase II and III  audits , prior  to  scheduling  such  audits,  the  CB  must  contact  BAP  and  provide justification for any decision to move to onsite audits.
- · Such an outcome would trigger additional  BAP  invoicing  since  initial  invoicing  for Salmon  Farm  Group  Surveillance  audits  assumes  that  no  onsite  auditing  will  be needed.

## A2.0 7 Supplementary Onsite Phase II and III Audits

- · In cases where it is determined that Phase II and III Site audits must be performed to confirm Group conformance, the auditor shall select a number of sites to be audited based  on  applicable  risk  factors  as  outlined  in  the  Farm/Hatchery  Group  Program

document section 4.8.4 ( I.e., the number of sites on which to perform Phase III audits is to be determined by using the normal SQRT +1 formula, plus adding additional sites beyond  this  minimum,  NOT  just  a  minimal  number  of  surveillance  site  audits  as described  in  Section  3  of  this  Appendix.    When  significant  risk  factors  have  been identified, a full audit, including a full set of onsite Phase II and Phase III Site audits, must be performed ).

## A2.0 8 Surveillance Audit Scenarios

## Scenario 1 (Successful Audit Conclusion)

- · All requirements have been met (and any Non-Conformities have been resolved within  the  specified  time  frames).The  audit  result  demonstrates  to  both  the auditor and the Certification Body that continuous compliance to the BAP Group Program and Salmon Farm Standard is being maintained. No onsite Phase II or Phase III audits were required.
- · Annual program fees must be paid so the 2-year certificate is maintained.
- · The  original  BAP  Validation  Letter,  Certification  Body's  certificate  and  BAP website listing may have to be amended to reflect any additions/removals to the Group since initial certification.
- · After successful completion of the Surveillance audit, the BAP Group Certificate shall be amended to reflect the updated site registry of the Group.

## Scenario 2 (Unsuccessful Audit Conclusion)

- · All requirements have not been met.
- The audit result demonstrates to both the auditor and Certification Body that continuous compliance to the BAP Farm and Hatchery Group Program and the Salmon Farm Standard is not being maintained .
- · Failure  to  close  any  Identified  non-conformities  against  the  Group  in  the specified time frames to the satisfaction of the Certification Body could lead to suspension of Group certificate. Suspension may be lifted following a complete re-audit of the Group.

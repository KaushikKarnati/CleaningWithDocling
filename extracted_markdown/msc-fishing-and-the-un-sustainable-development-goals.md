The fishing and seafood sector has an important role to play in delivering the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 14, Life below water. This briefing sets out the role of sustainable fishing and seafood certification in supporting sustainable development across environmental, social and economic goals. It summarises an analysis of how engaging with the Marine Stewardship Council's (MSC) program for sustainable fishing contributes to five SDGs, and how governments and businesses can access the MSC's tools and data to demonstrate their efforts towards delivering these shared targets.

## Key messages

- ·   Fishing and seafood production are intrinsically linked to economic prosperity, livelihoods, nutrition, biodiversity and ecosystems. Efforts to improve the sustainability of fishing support the delivery of multiple SDGs.
- · Sustainable fishing is integral to delivering SDG 14, Life below water, which includes targets to end overfishing and protect and restore ecosystems. Delivering this goal also supports the delivery of multiple other SDGs. However, SDG 14 has been acknowledged as one of the most difficult to achieve 1  and despite its importance has seen limited progress 2 .  No country is close to achieving SDG14 3 .
- · Analysis shows that organisations, including fisheries, governments and seafood companies, that engage with the MSC program are helping to deliver at least 34 targets across five SDGs. Their commitments to MSC certification support environmental, social and economic sustainability.
- · Some national governments and businesses are already using certification to the MSC's standards as evidence of progress towards targets in SDG14. Data from the MSC program is already recognised by the UN as an indicator for measuring actions to safeguard the ocean and biodiversity. This data is available to the international community, including governments, businesses and investors, to monitor and credibly evidence efforts to deliver the SDGs.

## The Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established in 2015 and are set to run until 2030. These 17 global goals, which include 169 targets, provide a framework to address the urgent challenges for environmental, social and economic sustainable development. They are a shared vision for the future to guide governments, industry, non-profit organisations and the entire global community in working together for a better world. Member states are expected to implement the SDGs in their national frameworks and frequently report on their progress, with many businesses doing the same.

With 2023 marking the halfway point to the 2030 deadlines set for most SDGs, the pressure to accelerate progress is increasing.

## The importance of sustainable fishing and seafood

Fishing and seafood production are intrinsically linked to economic prosperity, livelihoods, nutrition, biodiversity, and ecosystems, with benefits that span multiple SDGs.

For many countries, fishing plays a vital role in food security (SDG2), providing healthy nutrition for billions of people  (SDG 3). Fishing and seafood production also employ millions 9 of people (SDG 1), and, as the world's most traded food commodity, seafood is essential to many national economies (SDG 8). Sustainable fisheries management, which contributes to higher and more stable seafood production over the long-term, therefore offers opportunities to secure food, livelihoods and economic stability for future generations.

From an environmental perspective, as the impacts of climate change (SDG 13) take hold, fisheries will need to adapt to changes in the distribution of fish stocks. Recent research has also demonstrated the potential of food from the ocean to help reduce carbon emissions from food 10 .

Sustainable fishing, that reduces environmental impacts and prevents overexploitation, is essential to achieving and maintaining productive and healthy marine ecosystems (SDG 14). And efforts to improve the sustainability of fishing are encouraging responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and building constructive partnerships across industry, government, business, NGOs and scientific institutions (SDG 17).  The sustainable transformation of the fishing industry is also leading to innovation that will increase the efficiency of seafood harvests and lead to more environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes (SDG 9).

## The importance of SDG 14 'Life Below Water'

SDG 14, Life below water, aims to 'conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development' . This goal has been identified as critical for the delivery of other SDGs, in particular those related to hunger, economic growth and partnership 11 . Despite this, SDG 14 remains significantly underfunded 12  and one of the least studied 13 . On average, only 1.2% of national research budgets were allocated for ocean science between 2013 and 2017 14 . This proportion is miniscule compared with the modestly estimated US$1.5 trillion contribution of the ocean to the global economy in 2010 15 .

SDG 14 has been acknowledged as one of the most difficult to achieve 16 . Analysis shows that SDG 14's targets, particularly related to overfishing, have seen limited progress 17 .  No country is close to achieving SDG 14 18 . As a result, 'Life below water' remains high on the international agenda, with the UN calling for urgent, coordinated, global action to continue to advance towards delivering these targets 19 .

The global fishing sector has a vital role in delivering SDG 14. Of particular importance are SDG 14.2, to manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to achieve healthy and productive oceans , and SDG 14.4, to effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing . Both of these targets had deadlines of 2020.  Target 14.4 has seen the slowest progress of any SDG 14 target with only the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Tuvalu securing sustainable fish stocks 21 .

The past eight years have seen progress to improve international fisheries management, for example with the Port State Measures Agreement, the agreement for Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (BBNJ) and the World Trade Organization's agreement to end harmful fishing subsidies. Better management of our ocean resources is beginning to pay off. Many of the world's largest commercial fish stocks have seen significant health improvements, with 82.5% of 2019 landings from biologically sustainable stocks, a 3.8% improvement from 2017 22 . However, destructive trends continue 23 . The rate of overfishing continues to increase from around 10% of monitored stocks in the 1970s to more than 35% in 2020 24 . Scientists estimate that at least 25% marine mammals are at risk of extinction 25 .

The benefits of delivering on SDG 14 targets are significant. According to the World Bank, ending overfishing could help to deliver US$80 billion in economic benefits a year 26 . Analysis by the MSC has found that ending overfishing could provide enough protein for 72 million additional people a year 27 , providing vital nutrients to millions 28 .

The UN suggests that the recovery of 98% of currently overfished stocks would be possible by the middle of the century if appropriate governance was in place 29 . Delivering this potential will require sustained collaboration and joint action, together with investment.

When it comes to wild-catch fisheries, effective management has proven to be the most effective approach to conserving aquatic resources… Effective management, along with its errant twin ineffective management, hold important keys to our achievement of SDG 14.

<!-- image -->

## TARGET 14.1

## REDUCE MARINE POLLUTION

By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.

## TARGET 14.2

## PROTECT AND RESTORE ECOSYSTEMS

By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.

## TARGET 14.4

## SUSTAINABLE FISHING

By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.

## TARGET 14.5

## CONSERVE COASTAL AND MARINE AREAS

By 2020, conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.

## TARGET 14.6

## END SUBSIDIES CONTRIBUTING TO OVERFISHING

By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.

## TARGET 14.7

## INCREASE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE RESOURCES

By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

## TARGET 14.A

## INCREASE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, RESEARCH

AND TECHNOLOGY FOR OCEAN HEALTH Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries.

## TARGET 14.B

## SUPPORT SMALL SCALE FISHERS

Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets.

<!-- image -->

## TARGET 14.C

## IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE INTERNATIONAL SEA LAW

Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of 'The future we want'.

Target 14.3, reduce ocean acidification, is the only SDG 14 target not relevant to sustainable fishing.

Analysis shows that the MSC program contributes to all SDG 14 targets apart from 14.3 and 14.6.

## How the MSC program supports delivery of the SDGs

New analysis by the MSC shows that fisheries, governments and companies' involvement in the MSC program is helping to deliver 34 targets across five of the most relevant SDGs relating to zero hunger, decent work, ocean conservation, sustainable consumption, and partnerships. While the benefits of MSC certification may extend beyond these goals, these five SDGs are the most pertinent to the MSC's vision of oceans teeming with life and seafood supplies safeguarded for future generations.

Sustainable fisheries management, as set down in the MSC Standard, contributes to zero hunger (SDG 2) by ensuring higher and more stable fishery productivity over the long-term. It has been estimated that 72 million more people each year could have their protein needs met if all fisheries were managed sustainably 31 . Increasing the proportion of fish stocks that are sustainably managed has been shown to be an important component of increasing global food security and nutrition 32 .

Securing the long-term future of fishing communities and those involved in the fishing sector, will be accomplished by securing the long-term future of ocean resources. 600 million people are employed in the fishing and seafood sector globally 33 .  Fisheries involved in the MSC program are therefore contributing to SDG 8, relating to decent work and economic growth.

The MSC program supports the growth of sustainable seafood supply chains by providing a credible global framework based on the UN's guidelines for sustainable fishing with which fisheries, governments and businesses can focus efforts, investment and science to achieve internationally recognised standards for sustainable fishing. The MSC also provides tools and funding to support improvements, together with data to demonstrate tangible actions. This supports SDG 14, Life below water, as well SDG 12 on sustainable consumption.

Stocks which are targeted by MSC certified fisheries score higher on key sustainability criteria including abundance of fish, than those which are targeted non-certified fisheries 34 . The MSC Fisheries Standard directly helps to deliver SDG 14 across multiple targets. This includes target 14.2 to protect and restore marine ecosystems, 14.4 to effectively regulate harvesting, end overfishing and implement science-based management plans, 14.A to increase scientific knowledge for ocean health and 14.C to implement and enforce international sea law. In some contexts, MSC certification also contributes to reducing marine pollution (14.1) and conserving coastal marine areas (14.5), while the MSC program overall supports the economic benefits from sustainable fishing (14.7) and small scale fisheries (14.B).

Retailer and brand commitments to MSC certification can also provide a financial incentive for sustainable fishing through market demand for certified seafood with the blue MSC ecolabel. The MSC works with some of the world's leading retailers and seafood brands to influence positive change within the seafood sector. It is also helping to increase understanding of the importance of choosing sustainable seafood, with global marketing and communications campaigns reaching millions of people every year. This helps to drive sustainable consumption (SDG 12).

The MSC works with stakeholders from across the seafood sector including business, governments, conservationists and scientists helping to build collaborative partnerships needed to transform the seafood sector, and deliver SDG 17. Almost half (48%) of the 225 NGOs, seafood industry professionals and experts from 31 countries who took part in the MSC's SDG leadership forum for Goal 14 in 2019 believe that sustainable sourcing policies are the most effective way to accelerate progress towards ending the crisis facing the oceans.

Overall, the MSC's analysis shows that efforts to meet the MSC standards, and commitments to certified sustainable seafood, are helping deliver at least 34 different SDG targets out of a possible 60 targets across SDGs 2, 8, 12, 14 and 17. A breakdown of this new analysis can be found in the appendix.

In 2001 the Red Rock Lobster fishery in Baja California in Mexico became the first small scale fishery from a developing economy to be MSC certified. The certified fishery is made up of nine of the 10 cooperatives that are part of the Regional Federation of Cooperative Societies of Baja California (FEDECOOP) which collectively employ 2,000 people in lobster production, processing and export. The fishery lands around 1,300 tonnes of lobster per year, around 90% of which is exported live to Asia bringing valuable export income to the region.

<!-- image -->

MSC certification of the fishery was originally supported by the NGO Comunidad y Biodiversidad (COBI) as a strategy to make new social and economic incentives available to the best managed fisheries in the country. Certification was seen by the fishing cooperative to support international recognition and government support for the fishery as well as an opportunity to compete on the international market with the Western Australian Rock Lobster fishery. The fishery received funding for its initial certification from the Mexican government and WWF.

The benefits of certification have included improved management of the fishery and helped to secure community investment, including provision of infrastructure, electricity and fishing gear. To maintain its MSC certification the fishery has delivered improvements to its sustainability, including diligently recording bycatch, tracking discarded fish and improving its harvest strategies, providing the evidence needed to show with greater certainty that the lobster stock is sustainably fished.

This example shows how working with the MSC sustainable fishing program can contribute to SDG 14, life below water, and SDG 17, partnerships, as well as SDG 8, decent work and economic growth.

## MSC data to measure SDG contributions

As the deadline for completion of the SDGs grows nearer, there is increasing interest in how to credibly measure progress towards these global goals. Data from the MSC program can be used by governments, business and NGOs in reporting on actions to support delivery of the SDGs. This data is already formally recognised as an indicator to delivering the UN Biodiversity Framework, it is also recognised by the UN Environment Program and is available at a global and national scale.

Both the UN Fisheries &amp; Agriculture Organisation's State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2020 report and the UN's 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook report highlight MSC certified fisheries that are contributing to progress towards the SDG targets.

Examples of data available from the MSC:

- · MSC certified catch volumes *†
- · MSC certified catch as a percentage of total catch
- · Number of MSC certified supply chain operations *†
- · Number of products with the MSC label †
- · Volumes of products sold with the MSC label †
- * UN Biodiversity Framework Indicators
- † Indicator for the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership

Financial institutions such as SMN in Norway are already using MSC certification to verify sustainability claims, with WWF and the UNEP Financial Initiative recognising MSC certification as an indicator of responsible investment in fisheries production 35 . In 2020 the Government of India included fisheries certification as an action towards delivering SDG 14 in its Voluntary National Review on sustainable development 36 . Many businesses and governments have also incorporated commitments to achieving MSC certification into their commitments to deliver SDG 14 at the Our Oceans Conference 37 .

## Seven years for action

In conclusion, sustainable fishing and seafood supply chains offer huge potential to support the global ambitions set out by the SDGs, with the potential to bring local and world-wide benefits for people and planet. However, achieving Goal 14, Life below water, is proving to be one of the most challenging, requiring international cooperation, investment, science and collaboration across sectors.

Governments, fisheries and businesses looking to accelerate action on SDGs can use the MSC program as a framework to identify, deliver and measure tangible actions towards achieving multiple SDGs, in particular SDG 14. The tools, data and standards provided by the MSC have been developed over 25 years in consultation with stakeholders from across the globe, to provide a rigorous and accessible program which is helping to put our wild-capture fisheries on a pathway to sustainability.

<!-- image -->

The MSC has a goal for over a third of global wild seafood harvest to be engaged with our program by 2030. To achieve our vision of oceans teeming with life and seafood supplies secured for this and future generations, we are seeking to grow our global partnerships through our work with fisheries, business, governments and NGOs to help to ensure that sustainable fishing is at the centre of efforts to achieve global progress envisaged by the SDGs.

Visit msc.org for details on the tools, funding and data available from MSC.

<!-- image -->

We have a route map agreed by 193 nations to fulfil the SDGs by 2030; now is the best chance for humanity to move onto a more sustainable and equitable trajectory-to double down and deliver. The MSC has an aspirational target to engage a third of global landings. This will make a significant contribution, through the leadership of our partners, to the delivery of SDG 14.

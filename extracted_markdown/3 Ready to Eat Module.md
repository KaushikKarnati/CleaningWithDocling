Seafood Processing Standard - Ready to Eat Module

Issue Number 1.0

## A Introduction

The purpose of the Ready to Eat module is to provide clauses that facilities shall be audited against if ready to  eat  products  are  part  of  the  facility's  production  process  and  scope. The  intent  of  this  module  is  to minimize  potential  cross  contamination  during  the  production  process  that  could  cause  food  borne illnesses.  The  clauses  stated  within  this  module reflect global  industry  best  practices,  international scientific data, and global regulatory guidance. This module shall be audited in combination with the Core Seafood Processing Standard 6.0.

## B Scope

The scope of this module is all raw or cooked fishery products that are intended to be consumed without further cooking or processing. Examples of products covered in the module are ready-to-eat (RTE) raw, chilled, or frozen fish (sashimi), pasteurized crab, surimi, hot and cold smoked salmon, acidified , and cured products.

## C Clause Requirements

- RTE1

Facilities producing cured, salted, and smoked products and cooked products shall apply the guidelines  for  such  products  as  specified  in  the  Association  of  Food  and  Drug  Officials (AFDO)  Cured,  Salted,  and  Smoked  Fish  Establishments  Good  Manufacturing  Practices  2019 or equivalent in both country of origin and the countries of export.

- RTE2 For thermal pasteurization processes, the validity of the process shall be established by a scientific study in writing that shall be provided to the auditor.
- RTE3 Container cooling water shall be chlorinated or otherwise sanitized as necessary. Monitoring records of sanitizer residue levels in cooling water discharge shall be kept.
- RTE4 There shall be filtered positive air flow in any high risk processing areas.
- RTE5 Process wastewater shall drain away from high risk areas (cooking and ready-to-eat) to lower risk areas. A map of the drainage system shall be available.
- RTE6 Foods  that  support  the  growth  of  L.  monocytogenes  shall  have  validated  antimicrobial control measures implemented and related process control records kept.
- RTE7 Low risk/high risk areas, cleaning gear, and PPE, shall be identified within the facility and high risk shall be effectively separated from low risk areas.
- RTE8 Wood pallets shall be inspected, cleaned, and sanitized prior to entry into the RTE areas.
- RTE9 There shall be dedicated and accessible hands-free handwashing stations located at each entrance to the RTE areas and throughout the food production areas which shall be equipped with hygiene supplies, hand sanitizer stations and hands-free dryer stations. Mechanical airdrying devices shall be tested based on manufacturer's recommendation or risk assessment each

for microbiological contamination. Handwashing  signage shall be posted at handwashing station that demonstrates the handwashing and sanitizing process.

RTE10

If the facility uses disposable gloves within the RTE area, the gloves shall be discarded and replaced and new gloves shall be sanitized each time a worker touches their face, leaves the

RTE room ,  removes any item from the floor, touches unsanitary surfaces ,  or  if  the  gloves become torn or damaged.

- RTE11 PPE used in the RTE areas shall be dedicated to the RTE areas. In addition to other protective clothing, face masks shall be worn in RTE areas. Protective clothing shall be replaced at a frequency based on risk or at a minimum once per shift.
- RTE12 Laundry services may be conducted by an outside approved 3rd party contractor or internally by the facility.  Validation  of  the  cleaning  process  is  required  for  both  internal  or  external services. Smocks/uniforms shall be protected before use.
- RTE13 Footwear in the RTE area shall be controlled to prevent or minimize cross contamination.
- RTE14 All items, including cleaning equipment and PPE used in RTE areas shall be identifiable and kept separate from those used in low risk areas. The cleaning and sanitation procedures shall be documented and verified.
- RTE15 Maintenance  Personnel  shall  receive  documented  training  before  working  on  the  RTE production  floor  on  how  to  prevent  cross  contamination.  This  training  shall  occur  at  a minimum frequency of annually and upon assignment to the maintenance department.
- RTE16 A documented risk based Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) shall be implemented to target Listeria spp. The EMP plan shall contain the following elements at a minimum:
- · Hygienic Zoning swab sites identified in plan
- · High risk zones shall be swabbed at a minimum frequency of weekly
- · Periodic changing of sample site locations for all zones shall be conducted
- · Corrective action plan
- · Training of plant employees on Listeria control
- · Raw material controls
- · Operational swabbing that occurs during operations shall be incorporated into the EMP plan
- RTE17 The results of the EMP program shall be tracked and trended to identify potential Listeria spp. in the ready to eat area.
- RTE18 Sanitation verification activities shall occur at a minimum prior to the start of each production shift. Verification activities shall include ATP Swabbing and/or protein residue test, and pre -operational visual inspections.
- RTE19 The facility shall have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that defines what measures shall  be  taken  to  prevent  potential  pathogen  introduction  during  machinery  installations, repairs, construction, or renovations.
- RTE20 There shall be a personal hygiene policy to prevent all workers contacting exposed RTE food with  their  bare  hands  unless  the  facility  can  demonstrate  through  risk  assessment  that

controls are in place to prevent cross contamination.

## B. Introduction

Founded in 1997, the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) is an international non-governmental organization dedicated to advocacy, education and leadership in responsible aquaculture. GSA engages stakeholders worldwide who are dedicated to advancing environmentally and socially responsible aquaculture practices. Through  the  development  of  the  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  (BAP)  certification  standards,  GSA  has become the leading standards-setting organization for aquaculture seafood (see https://www.globalseafood.org/ and www.bapcertification.org).

## Background to the Standard and Standard Scope

This document is the Seafood Processing Standard (SPS) - Issue 5.1. The Standard was formerly known as the Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) Seafood Processing Standard - Issue 4.2 and later SPS 5.0.

The full scope of the Seafood Processing Standard includes:

- · Food Safety Management and Related Requirements (Sections 1-4)
- · Social Responsibility Requirements (Sections 5-6)
- · Environmental Management Requirements (Section 7)
- · Animal Welfare Requirements (Section 8)
- · Traceability Requirements (Section 9)
- · Glossary (Annex 1)
- · Effluent Management Requirements (Annex 2)
- · Additional Traceability Verification Requirements (Annex 3)
- · Third-Party Laboratory Sampling and Testing Verification Requirements (Annex 4)
- · Water Quality Testing Requirements (Annex 5)

To  achieve  clarity  for  standards  benchmarking,  sections  1-9  have  been  kept  separate  from  the Annexes.  However, compliance with all elements (full scope) are required for certification.

The  objective  of  the  Food  Safety  Management  and  Related  Requirements  of  the  Seafood  Processing Standard  is  to  specify  the  food  safety  and  quality  criteria  required  to  be  in  place  within  a  seafood manufacturing or processing organization to achieve certification to the SPS. The format and content of the Standard is  designed  to  allow  an  assessment  of  a  Company's  premises  and  operational  systems  and procedures by a competent third-party Certification Body.

The Seafood Processing Standard covers nearly all aquaculture and wild-caught species as follows:

- · Finfish
- · Crustaceans
- · Mollusks
- · Echinoderms
- · Medusozoans

The scope of operations covered under this standard include only those processes that are performed in land-based facilities and operated by the facility.

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

## Standards Development

Through the development of its Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) program, the GSA became the leading standards-setting organization for farmed seafood.

In 2003 it released its first BAP standard for the certification of shrimp farms and in 2004, in recognition of the critical importance of seafood processing in delivering safe products, it published the BAP Standard for Shrimp Processing Plants.

In 2007 this standard was rewritten to cover a wide range of aquaculture products beyond shrimp. In June 2008, the GSA began an expert led, extensive Review Project to restructure its Standards and Certification Management to validate that they met the benchmarking requirement of the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI 1 ).

This process was completed in 2009 and included re-formatting the 2007 version of the BAP Seafood Processing Standard to enhance it and improve clarity. The result was The GSA BAP Seafood Processing Standard: Food Safety Management Component: Issue 2 May 2009. In August 2012 Issue 2 was slightly modified to incorporate a few additional clauses per GFSI requirements.

In  March  2013,  revisions  were  made  to  the  annexes  which  are  not  part  of  the  GFSI  management component.   These  revisions  affected  only  Annex  2,  Social  Responsibility  and  resulted  in  the  present version - Issue 3. In January 2014, Annex 3 incurred a minor revision for the effluent table and therefore remained as Issue 3 Rev. In April 2015, the standard was revised to align all elements of the standard and interpretation guidelines (IG) for clarity, eliminate redundant clauses, and add new clauses to strengthen certain quality, food safety, social responsibility and traceability components.

As many of the above contributors changed companies, locations or became inactive over the years, a standing Plant Technical Committee was formed in 2017 representing industry, social responsibility, and food safety expertise. The GSA is grateful to the members of the committee who contributed to the revision of  the  standard  undertaken  in  2017  and  early  2018,  as  well  as  to  the  other  third-party  experts  that participated in reviews and comments. The members of the standing Plant Technical Committee include:

Greg Brown, BAP Program Integrity Manager Lawnin Crawford, Thai Union Ken Corpron, BAP Program Integrity Analyst Marco Daza, Independent seafood processing plant auditor Guy Ewing, Independent seafood processing plant auditor John Forester, Forester Consulting Victor Garrido, Quirch Foods Kathy Janiga, FQS Global Murali Krishna Bujji, Independent Auditor Birgitte Krogh-Poulsen, Independent Social Accountability Consultant Dan Lee, GSA/BAP Standards Coordinator Cormac O'Sullivan, SGS Paul Macintyre, Acoura Marine Peter Marshall, RS Standards Myles Millholland, NSF Ralph Parkman, Independent seafood processing plant auditor Conrad Powell, Independent seafood processing plant auditor Avery Siciliano, BAP Corporate Responsibility

Thomas White, NSF

In addition, GSA commissioned a different team at UL to conduct a separate, detailed third-party assessment of  Annex  2  -  Social  Responsibility.  This  assessment  was  completed  in  January  2015,  with  the  results informing several of the changes made to that section.

In February 2018 Annex 2, Social Accountability Management Requirements, was reviewed and updated by Birgitte Krogh-Poulson, an independent social accountability and labor issues expert. Annex 2 was adopted into the primary text of the Standard Issue 5.0 (Section 5-6).

This Standard will be regularly reviewed to ensure its relevance with legislation and market requirements.

The normative documents from which the initial standard (or subsequent versions as noted) were drawn upon were/are:

- · ISO 9001:2015
- · ISO 19011:2018
- · ISO 17021-1:2015

## Program Management

The Global Seafood Alliance is the Program Manager for the Seafood Processing Standard (SPS).

Companies who wish to be certified against the Seafood Processing Standard must apply via the online PORTal  available  at  https://www.bapcertification.org/ (select  'Sign  in'  then  click  'Don't  have  an account? Create one now!').

Already certified facilities must re-apply to renew their certification annually.

Mailing Address: 85 New Hampshire Avenue, Suite 200, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801 USA

Main Office Telephone: +1-603-317-5000

For questions regarding applications: bapcert@bapcertification.org

Website: www.bapcertification.org and https://www.globalseafood.org/

## Self-Assessment

New applicants are required to carry out a self-assessment against the standard to ascertain their readiness for a third-party Certification Body audit.  The application on the website includes the 'Audit self-assessment' that can be used for the self-assessment. It has the same questions as the SPS audit checklist. Applicants are to rectify any deficiencies identified as part of their self-assessment, prior to the third-party CB audit.

## Assessments

Once an applicant's self-assessment has been carried out and is satisfied that all deficiencies identified have been corrected, the company can proceed to Certification.

To become certified, Applicants must be able to demonstrate compliance with this Standard, through an independent third-party on-site assessment by a GSA Approved Certification Body (CB).

The Certification Body must be approved by GSA and be accredited to ISO/IEC 17065:2012 (Conformity assessment - Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services) by an Accreditation Body  who  is  a  Member  of  the  International  Accreditation  Forum  and  a  signatory  to  the  Multilateral Recognition Agreement.

The chosen Certification Body will formulate an agreement between the Applicant and the Certification Body detailing the requirements and commitments needed from the Applicant.

The GSA will maintain a list of approved Certification Bodies.

Facilities that are newly built and 'green field' facilities must ensure that the requirements of the Standard are well implemented before they proceed to an initial assessment by the third-party Certification Body. Such facilities must be in operation for at least 3 months from commencing production to ensure that they can  provide  documentation  and  records  that  demonstrate  full  compliance  to  the  Standard  during  the assessment.

## Assessment Frequency

Audits to the Seafood Processing Standard are conducted at a frequency once per annum. However, reaudits,  short  notice,  or  unannounced  audits  shall  also  be  conducted  at  GSA  and  Certification  Body discretion where facility compliance concerns arise.

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

## Transition to New Issues of Standard

When a new issue of the Seafood Processing Standard is released, facilities will have the option to be audited under the older issue for up to one year or, they may opt to be audited under the new issue. New applicants will be audited under the newer issue. This being a revision to the SPS 5.0, it is effective 60 days from the date of revision.

## Scope of Audit

## Duration of Assessments, and Non-Conformities

The duration of an assessment is dependent on a number of factors such as the size of the operation, number of workers, process lines, HACCP plans, and/or number of species processed.  In most cases the duration would be a minimum of two days (all on site or combined desk top review in advance, then on site). In all cases it shall be sufficient to ensure that a full assessment against the full scope of the SPS Standard, including the Annexes, is achieved.

The GSA will insist upon accurate assessments by the Certification Body with a duration sufficient to ensure integrity of the audit and achieve the audit objectives.

The Certification  Body shall be  mindful  that  the  assessment format  is one  of systems review  and physical inspection of the site and manufacturing process. Time allocation during the Assessment shall be such to provide sufficient and proportionate time for each activity to be carried out in full and where appropriate, additional time given when the Auditor is required to carry out further investigation.

All requirements in the Standard shall be addressed. As with other GSA-BAP standards, the audit against the SPS will consist of the elements cited in Figure 1 in accordance with ISO19011.

- · opening meeting
- · site assessment (including dormitory and canteen, if applicable)
- · collection of any necessary samples (product and effluent)
- · worker interviews
- · review of management systems / records and procedures
- · closing meeting
- · provision of non-conformance summary to the facility

Any Non-Conformity raised during the assessment will be recorded by the auditor as either:

| Severity Level                                                                                                                                                                                       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Required Action   |

| Where absolute compliance with  requirements and/or the intent of  any clause in the Standard has  not been demonstrated. The  matter does not rise to the level  of Major or Critical and tends to  be lower risk issues or isolated  instances rather than patterns.  Not indicative of an overall  breakdown in compliance and  Objective evidence verifying the  proper implementation of  corrective actions and closure of  non-conformities shall be  submitted to the Certification  Body in accordance with GSA  certification management rules. | Minor |

At the closing meeting, the Auditor shall present his/her findings and discuss all non-conformities that have been identified during the assessment but shall not make any comment on the likely outcome of the Assessment. A written  summary  of  the  non-conformities  discussed  at  the  closing  meeting  shall  be  agreed  upon  and signatures from the facility representative obtained. A copy of the non-conformity report must be left with the facility prior to the auditor departing the facility.

The facility shall provide the CB, in accordance with GSA-BAP certification management rules, suitable and adequate objective evidence that corrective action has been implemented to rectify the non-conformity. This evidence shall also address root cause and future prevention. The evidence will be reviewed, and the CB will respond either confirming closure of the non-conformity or requesting further evidence.

The facility must submit evidence to the CB in order to close out all non-conformities within 35 calendar days. Failure to close out non-conformities in the given timeframe will result in certification not being granted or continued, and facilities will be required to re-apply for a full assessment for certification (refer current issue of GSA-BAP Policy on Supplementary Audits of Facilities).

## Audit Reporting and the Certification Decision

The Auditor will provide a full report of the assessment, including the details of any non-conformities issued. The Auditor will submit the report to the Certification Body. The report shall include brief statements of objective evidence of both conformity, and non-conformity.

The report shall follow the format specified by the GSA . The report shall be issued in accordance with the GSA Report Guidelines. Within the Assessment Report there shall be a record of the duration of the assessment (expressed as hours) and any reason for the lengthening or shortening of the duration from that which is typical.

The audit report along with the corrective actions submitted by the facility will be evaluated by a Certification Committee of the CB, who will make the final certification decision post closure of all non-conformities. The timelines for audit, closure of non-conformities, technical review and certification decision are as specified in the GSA-BAP CB Requirements Document. In order to achieve certification to the Seafood Processing Standard, the applicant facility must meet all of the requirements of the Standard.

The Applicant who commissioned the Assessment owns the Assessment Report. However, a written agreement shall be in place between the GSA-approved Certification Body and the auditee for the authorization of the provision of a Report to the GSA.

When audit reports are sent to the Applicant, they shall be in a secure (PDF) format to prevent modification.

The Assessment report will be considered by a Certification Committee of the Certification Body, who will make the final certification decision.

## Appeals

The Applicant has the right to appeal the certification decision of the Certification Body. Appeals should be made in writing within seven days of the Certification decision.

A full response will be given by a Certification Body Manager independent of the auditor and Certification Committee.

## GSA Certification

In  order  to  achieve  Certification  to  the  Seafood  Processing  Standard,  the  Applicant  must  meet  the requirements of all components of the Seafood Processing Standard. This means all components of the standard including the Annexes must be in compliance.

## ANNEX 1 - Glossary

## Accreditation

Procedure  by  which  an  authoritative  body  gives  formal  recognition  of  the  competence  of  a Certification Body to provide certification services, against an international standard.

## Accreditation Body

Agency  having  jurisdiction  to  formally  recognize  the  competence  of  a  Certification  Body  to  provide certification services.

## Accuracy Checks

Checking if an instrument is working properly by comparing it to a known-accurate item, typically against a single point of reference  (such  as  the  boiling point of water). If the thermometer  cannot  be calibrated/adjusted by the facility, then it is not 'calibration' but an accuracy check.  Where an inaccurate item cannot  be  adjusted  it is NOT  to  be  used.    See  'calibration' below  as  well  as  'internal calibration/accuracy checks' and 'external calibration/accuracy checks'.

## Allergen

Food causing an adverse reaction that is mediated by an immunological response.  Different countries have different  recognized  allergens.    Facilities  and  auditors  must  ensure  they  are  aware  of  the  recognized allergens in the local country and countries that product is exported to ensure they are properly addressed.

## Assimilative Capacity

Assimilative capacity refers to the ability of the environment or a portion of the environment (such as a stream, lake, river) to carry waste material without adverse effects on the environment or on users of its resources. Pollution occurs only when the assimilative capacity is exceeded.

## Assessment

Examination of production facilities, to verify that they conform to requirements.

## Audit

Systematic and functionally independent examination to determine whether activities and related results comply  with  a  conforming  scheme,  whereby  all  the  elements  of  this  scheme  should  be  covered  by reviewing the suppliers' manual and related procedures, together with an assessment of the production facilities.

## Auditor

Person qualified to carry out audits for or on behalf of a Certification Body.

## BAP Star Status Definitions

Product cannot be claimed as 2, 3 or 4-star unless the rules in the standard and the rules stated in the BAP Logo Use Requirements document are strictly followed. Available at: https://www.bapcertification.org/WhatWeDo/ProgramIntegrity

## Calibration

As with 'Accuracy Checks', checking an instrument by comparing it to a known-accurate item. However, in this case the check would be against multiple points of comparison across the range of the instrument's operation.  And the instrument can then be adjusted back to accuracy where it is out of calibration.

## Certification

Procedure  by  which  Accredited  Certification  Bodies,  based  on  an  audit,  provide  written  or  equivalent assurance that food safety management systems and their implementation conform to requirements.

## Certification Body

Provider of certification services accredited to do so by an Accreditation Body.

## Certification Standard

A normative document, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in each context.

## Certification System

A system that has its own rules of procedure and management for carrying out Certification.

## Criteria (Audit)

Set  of  policies,  procedures  or  requirements  used  as  a  reference  against  which  objective  evidence  is compared.

## Conflict of Interest

Where either a Certification Body or any Auditor are in a position of trust requiring them to exercise judgement on behalf of others and has interests or obligations (whether financial or otherwise) of the sort that might interfere with their exercise of judgement.

## Evisceration

The complete sanitary removal of the contents of the stomach cavity  and gill region of finfish and  the complete sanitary removal of the contents of the mantle and head of cephalopods.

## External Calibration/Accuracy Checks

A processed batch of shrimp, fish, etc., produced by the plant during 1 day or 1 shift (day code).

## Food Defense

Threats could include intentional contamination of food products, sabotage of the supply chain, and using food or drink items for terrorism or criminal purposes. Food Defense risks are not HACCP-related but rather facility security/sabotage related.  Intended to prevent, for example:

- · tampering or adulteration of product or the water supply by entry of unauthorized personnel
- · entry by disgruntled or terminated employees.
- · uncontrolled access to storage areas
- · access to and misuse of toxic compounds in the facility

## Food Fraud

Food fraud includes incidents such as counterfeiting, adulteration, smuggling, stolen goods, dilution and mislabeling. All pose a risk as food being received may not be what it says it is and/or visibility could have been lost throughout the supply chain process.

HACCP Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic preventive approach to food  safety  and  pharmaceutical  safety  that  addresses  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  hazards  as  a means of prevention rather than finished product inspection. HACCP is used in the food industry to identify potential food safety hazards, so that key actions, known as Critical Control Points (CCP's) can be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of the hazards being realized.

## Internal Calibration/Accuracy Checks

Done 'internally' (i.e., by the facility) to regularly monitor if instruments are functioning properly.  External Calibration/Accuracy checks are then also done for verification as needed but at least annually.

## Mass Balance

The comparison of the weight of incoming raw material to finished products.  Calculations are done using appropriate recovery rates for the finished product form, taking into account weight loss or gain during the process, as applicable. Finished Product / Raw Material = Percent Yield

## Non-Conformity

Deviation of product or process from specified requirements, or the absence of, or failure to implement and maintain, one or more required management system elements, or a situation which would, on the basis of available objective evidence, raise significant doubt as to the conformity of what the supplier is supplying.

## Objectives

Result to be achieved.

## Objective Evidence

Data supporting the existence or verity of something.

## Peeling or de-heading sheds

Are defined as independent, third-party 'satellite' seasonal operation that engage in peeling or heading of shrimp, often temporarily, during peak harvest times without formal government approval and lack controls on legal, food safety, environmental and social processes.

## Primary Processor

A  processing  facility  that  receives  product  (without  any  transformation  to  the  whole  animal  or  minimal transformation like washing, gilling to maintain food safety) directly from farms and/or harvest vessels (for wild caught product). In general terms, primary processing of fish (aquatic animals) onshore will be treated as occurring at the place where the fish are both first assessed for their suitability for processing and are actually processed.

## Primary Product Form and Sampling Instructions:

As referred to in the SPS Standard - 'Primary Product Form' examples are:

- · raw
- · cooked
- · raw ready-to-eat.
- · breaded
- · smoked (cold and hot)
- · pickled
- · dried
- · canned

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

- · salted
- · marinated, etc.

## Product Recall

Product recalls are actions taken by a facility to remove a nonconforming product from the market including and up to the end consumers. Recalls may be conducted on a facility's own initiative, by regulatory body request, or by regulatory body order under statutory authority.

## Ready to Eat (RTE)

Items sold that require no cooking or limited re-heating.  Such as cooked shrimp, smoked salmon, raw fish for sushi or sashimi.

## Receiving Lot - Farm Suppliers

A batch of shrimp, fish, etc. delivered by a single farm, identified per culture unit (i.e., pond, cage, tank, etc.) to the SPS facility.

## Receiving Lot - Wild-Caught Suppliers

A batch of wild-caught seafood delivered by a single supplier, identified per vessel, location/date of harvest.

## Receiving Lot - Plant Suppliers

A processed batch of shrimp, fish, etc. produced by a plant that is supplying a SPS facility plant during 1 day or 1 shift (date code).

## Re-processor

A  processing  facility  that  receives  already-processed  products  that  are  in  consumer  ready  form  or packaging from a primary processor and transform those into value-added products.

## Top Management

Person or group of people who directs and controls an organization (see definition of organization) at the highest level.

## Traceability - Backward

A system to trace finished product to the origin of inputs including raw materials, ingredients/additives, packaging through all stages of production from shipment to suppliers of those inputs.

## Traceability - Forward

A  system  to  trace  products  to  the  destination  through  all  stages  of  production  from  receipt  through  to distribution up to customers.

## ANNEX 2 - Effluent Management Requirements

## A2 1.0 Effluent Discharge

- A2 1.1 No Discharge into Natural Water Bodies: Facilities that do not discharge any effluents directly or indirectly into naturally occurring water bodies and comply with all other SPS requirements are eligible for GSA certification. Examples: effluents used for irrigation or other purpose preventing discharge to naturally occurring water bodies. Where this is confirmed the requirements to sample and test effluents in Section 2 (below) do not apply.
- A2 1.2 Discharge to Municipal or Private Treatment Plants: Facilities that have a valid contract with a municipality  or  industrial  park  facility  that assumes  the  responsibility  to  treat  and  dispose  of effluents  in  compliance  with  government,  regional  and  local  regulations  are  eligible  for  GSA certification if all other GSA requirements are met. Where this is confirmed the requirements to sample and test effluents in Section 2 (below) do not apply.
- A2 1.2.1 Plants shall not exceed local or national government permitted load levels when discharging effluents to a municipal or industrial treatment facility.
- A2 1.3 On-Site  Treatment: Facility  treats  its  own  effluents  and  discharges  under  a  valid  government permit  into  a  naturally  occurring  water  body  (sea,  river,  estuary,  etc.)  and  all  GSA  effluent parameters are met as described in Section 2 (below).

## A2 2.0 Effluent Records (Where A2 1.3 Applies)

- A2 2.1 For New  Applicants : At  least  three  consecutive  months  of  effluent  data,  collected  during operation, must be available for effluents that enter natural bodies of water (rivers, streams, canals, estuaries, etc.). Effluent samples shall be analyzed for all the variables listed in the Table in Section 2 (including 3 months' worth for the quarterly variables).
- A2 2.2 For Recertification: Test results ongoing as noted in the table below.
- A2 2.3 To minimize the chance of disease transmission from effluents discharged to natural waters, plants shall screen out solids and treat effluents by chlorination or another method of disinfection which will kill the disease organisms before release. (Once the effluents are properly treated, disinfectant residues shall be neutralized, removed, or allowed to dissipate prior to effluent discharge).
- A2 2.4 Records of effluent water quality concentrations entering natural bodies of water shall comply with government regulations, or the SPS criteria (See Table below), whichever is stricter.

A2 2.4.1 * Mixing Zone Option for marine environments only:

- · Facilities that are unable to comply with the variable limits listed in Annex 2 Table 1, may elect an alternative approach to compliance by demonstrating that the water quality (as measured by the same set of variables) at the edge of the mixing zone (samples taken within a few meters downstream of the discharge pipe - closer or farther depending on the energy level of the receiving environment) and outside the mixing zone (samples taken upstream from the discharge pipe) does not differ. Sampling must be done on a quarterly basis.
- · For facilities that are unable to comply with the variable limits listed in Annex 2 Table 1, an assimilative capacity study on the receiving waters by a qualified third-party, updated annually, would be an acceptable alternative to demonstrate compliance. The results of the  assimilative  capacity  study  shall  show  that  there  are  no  adverse  effects  on  the receiving water bodies from the release of facility effluents.

A2 2.5   Facilities must record and submit the average annual concentrations for each variable for effluents that entered natural bodies ('receiving waters') of water from your facility during the last calendar year.  This will include:

- · pH (standard units)
- · Total suspended solids (mg/L)
- · Total ammonia nitrogen (mg/L)
- · Soluble phosphorus or total phosphorous (mg/L)
- · 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (mg/L)
- · Oil and grease (mg/L)
- · Dissolved oxygen (mg/L)

A2 2.5.1 The  facility  must  record  and  provide  to  the  auditor  the  annual  average  volume  of effluent discharge in cubic meters/day. The auditor shall report this data to GSA for informational purposes only.

A2 2.6  Collection of Effluent Samples during the Audit and Third-Party Laboratory Testing

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

## Instructions to Facilities and Auditors:

- · The auditor shall supervise the collection of representative effluent samples during every GSA audit where Section 2 applies.
- · Samples shall be taken by the facility, or the facility's designated third-party lab.  The auditor is to supervise this process and verify that samples are taken from the correct locations and using accepted sample collection methods. Sampling may only be conducted during periods when processing and cleaning is occurring.
- · Once the samples are collected, the auditor is to verify that they were properly marked with the sample number, date, time, facility name, sample location, and collection method (either grab or composite). Auditors must also ensure that samples are sealed with tamper-proof tape and sent to, or picked up by, the third-party testing laboratory prior to completion of each audit.
- · This obviously means that addressing effluent sampling shall not wait until the end of the audit.  Nor be done after hours or on weekends when third-party labs are closed.
- · Samples are to be tested for all parameters as described in Annex 2.  It is the facility's responsibility to ensure the third-party laboratory doing the testing is aware of and able to perform GSA required tests.
- · Testing costs are the responsibility of the facility.  Test results are to be forwarded for review, in a timely fashion, to the Certification Body responsible for conducting the audit.
- · The third-party lab is to obtain the Certification Body's contact information and email address for  directly  forwarding the test results to them in a timely fashion.  The facility shall give permission for this to the third-party lab.

A2 2.6.1 Where Annex 2 applies - were samples collected properly by the facility or thirdparty  lab,  from  the  correct  locations  and  using  accepted  sample  collection methods, marked and sealed properly and sent to or picked up by the third-party lab during the audit?  (Auditor to note in comments who collected the sample)

A2 2.6.2 Where Annex 2 applies - the auditor shall describe the correct sample label details here for each sample:  date, time, sampling location, and sample number.

- A2 2.6.3
- The auditor shall also record how the sample was packaged, and the name of the third-party lab that picked it up, and where the sample was shipped. The auditor shall verify and record that samples were shipped immediately by the facility, the shipping  method,  and  the  name  of  the  laboratory  to  which  they  were  sent. (Informational purposes only).

## ANNEX 3 - Additional Traceability Verification Requirements

This Annex applies to all applicant Seafood Processing Plants eligible to produce BAP 1, 2, 3 and/or 4-star products. All farmed products which are processed in a SPS-certified processing plant are a minimum of 1star BAP certified. Facilities that demonstrate documented linkages to BAP-certified farms and which may have further linkages to BAP-certified feed mills and/or hatcheries may qualify for the BAP multi-star logo chain of custody. Annex 3 is not applicable to Seafood Processing Plants that process only wild-caught species.

## BAP Star System and Star Status Verification

Product Identity Preservation, BAP Lot Identification , Logo Use or BAP Claims

See Annex 1: Glossary 'BAP Star Category Definitions and Key Rules' regarding BAP 1, 2, 3 and 4-star claims. Products cannot be labeled, claimed or sold in any way as 2, 3 or 4-star unless all of the rules in the Glossary as well as Section 9 and Annex 4 are complied with.

## General Information

## A3 1.0 Labeling

- A3 1.1  The facility shall have a documented label control procedure to ensure integrity BAP star category claims. The procedure shall include personnel authorized to approve, amend and release labels and its specifications and work instructions to control label use and their storage. The procedure shall also include the prevention of mislabeling of products of different BAP star categories for all applicable species.
- A3 1.2  The label control procedure shall include a procedure for the proper labeling and downgrading of the star status of products in the event the facility mixes product of different BAP star categories. Where this occurs, records shall be maintained demonstrating which products of different BAP star categories were mixed, and that the star status of resultant product was properly downgraded.

## Examples:

- · If 3-star BAP products are mixed with 2-star BAP products, then the entire product lot must be labelled as 2-star BAP product. The 3-star BAP products will lose its 3-star status.
- · Where 1 and 2-star products are mixed, or 1, 2 and 3-star products  are  mixed, the entire product lot shall be downgraded to 1 star).
- A3 1.3  The facility shall properly identify and label products of different BAP star categories whether or not BAP logo is used on packaging. Proper identification shall be maintained for each lot, for each star category,  on  all  documents  and  at  each  step  of  the  process  flow  from  raw  material  receiving, handling,  processing, packaging, storage and dispatch. Records shall be maintained to ensure integrity of BAP product claims and also demonstrate product of different BAP star categories are not mixed.

## A3 2.0 Lot Identification

The  numbered  points  below  contain  information  on  how  facilities  should  set  up  a  traceability system in order to successfully complete the required traceability exercises in Annex 3, below.

- A3 2.1  The facility shall assign a unique code or lot number separately for products of each BAP star category. This unique code or lot number shall be assigned at receiving and carry forward through each step of production, packaging and storage in order to easily identify and trace every lot of BAP 1, 2, 3 and 4-star products from each other, and from non-BAP products.

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard

Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

- A3 2.2  Product shall not be claimed as BAP 2, 3 or 4-star unless the unique code or lot number stated in A3 2.1 appears on all production documents from receiving throughout to shipping.  Or, where product is assigned a different code or number at some stage, the unique code or lot number referenced in A3 2.1 shall also be referenced in the production document(s) together with the new code. These  documents  shall also bear the BAP  certification number  of  the farm(s), hatchery/nursery and/or feed mill the product was sourced from, and the quantity per lot for each BAP star category.
- A3 2.3  Finished product codes and/or lot numbers that appear on the master carton and inner packaging shall either match the unique codes referenced in A3 2.1, or there shall be a reference back to those unique codes in finished product documents so that the packaging codes and the unique codes in A3 2.1 are tied to each other.
- A3 2.4  The codes and lot numbers referenced in A3 2.1 to A3 2.2 shall also be transferred to shipping documents that are provided directly to the purchaser/buyer.  The facility shall provide to the auditor the document being used for this purpose and the auditor shall record this information on the audit report.
- A3 2.5  For  each  shipment,  the  documents  referenced  in  A3  2.4  shall  also  record  the  breakdown  of quantities for each BAP star category and its unique code or lot number.

## Mass Balance for Verification of BAP Star Status Claims

The facility shall demonstrate that the traceability system is effective, and that product identity preservation has been maintained through conducting and documenting mass balance as described below.

- A3 2.6 The facility must record and provide to the auditor evidence of a documented relationship with all BAP facilities to which the facility is linked for purposes of star status claims, including the names of all supplying facilities, names of all receiving facilities, and the corresponding annual volume of BAP product exchanged between the named BAP facilities in metric tons/year.
- A3 2.7 Where the facility is eligible to produce BAP 2-star product(s), the facility shall keep an up-todate list of all of the BAP-certified farms that are supplying them since the last BAP audit.  This information  shall  also  include  the  quantity  by  species  actually  supplied  by  each  farm,  the productive capacity of each farm, and the BAP facility certification number for each farm.
- A3 2.8 Where the facility is eligible to produce BAP 3 and/or 4-star, the facility shall keep an up-to-date list of the BAP certified farms that are supplying them since the last BAP audit.
- A3 2.9 In addition, facilities producing  3-star product  shall require supplying  farms  to provide documentation  verifying  of  their  BAP  3-star  eligible  lots.  Likewise,  facilities  producing  4-star product  shall  require  supplying  farms  to  provide  documentation  verifying  of  their  BAP  4-star eligible lots.
- A3 2.10 The facility shall also conduct mass balance tests on a per lot basis for each star category per species and product form. Per lot mass balance verification data shall be provided to the auditor for verification.
- A3 2.11 Results from A3 2.10 and 9.6.2 shall clearly show that the quantity of inputs versus the outputs for  each  test  are  appropriate,  and  that  no  mixing  of  BAP-certified  products  with  non-certified products and no mixing of wild-caught with BAP eligible species occurred. (If the facility mixes product  of  different  BAP  star  categories  together  in  a  lot,  this  situation  shall  be  handled  as described  under  A3  1.2).    Calculations  shall  also  reflect  what  the  expected  recovery/yield percentage for each final product form is and how they were derived. (See Appendix 1, Glossary, for definition of Mass Balance).

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

A3 2.12 The facility shall provide the auditor a summary of the quantities for each BAP-certified species, broken down into their respective Star Status categories and this data shall be included in the audit report.

## Additional Auditor Guidance

Mass Balance Calculation:

- · Make reference to Mass Balance definition in Annex 1, and provide example calculation formula, such as: % Process Yield = Quantity of Finished Product/Quantity of Raw Material.
- · Mass  Balance  per  Lot  Code:  Note  that  Auditor  might  make  reference  to  examples generated during Facility Traceability Exercises and Presented in Annex 3.

## A3 3.0 Traceability Exercises

As required in Section 9 - Traceability Management of the SPS standard, the traceability system at each facility shall include all relevant inputs and outputs. This includes not just the information about the farm source of raw material and date code and lot information for the plant, but also for packaging, ingredients, and the entities to which the product was shipped.

The minimum number of traceability exercises to be performed by the auditor during the SPS facility audit is defined in the tables below. The results of these exercises shall be documented and shall demonstrate compliance with the standard.

- A3 3.1   The results of the trace-forward and trace back exercises shall be recorded for each star category the facility is authorized to produce. 100% accountability shall be achieved during the exercises.
- A3 3.2   Once the lots are selected by the auditor for tracing, the results for all of them combined shall be achieved in no more than one half-day (4 hours).
- A3 3.3   Mass balance shall also be recorded for each exercise. The auditor shall also record in the audit report what percent and tonnage of product the facility produced during the previous calendar year for  each  star  category  so  as  to  verify  the  selection  of  lots  and  the  number  of  exercises  were appropriate as described in the above table instructions. Final results for all exercises shall be in line with expectations.

## ANNEX 4 - Sampling and Testing Verification Requirement

Under the requirements of the current Standard, the auditor has a role during the annual audit, to arrange for the selection and collection of samples to be sent to a Third-party Laboratory for testing. Plants are responsible for all testing costs related to certification. SPS sampling requirements do not override legal sampling and testing obligations.

For aquaculture products, samples from different species are not to be mixed (i.e., composited), nor are samples of different Primary Product Forms to be mixed for microbiological testing.  Exceptionally, for drug testing, laboratories may be allowed to mix samples from different Primary Product Forms if there are not enough samples of raw frozen forms available. Compositing of samples is no longer to be done at the plant but must instead be done at the Third-party Laboratory.  No compositing between aquaculture (farmed) products and wild-caught fishery products is allowed.

## A4 1.0 During the Audit - Collection of Product Samples and Review of Test Results by CB-assigned Auditor

During the annual audit of seafood processing plants, GSA auditors or sampling personnel authorized by GSA  shall  collect  samples  of  finished  product  and  forward  them  directly  to  an  approved  ISO-17025 laboratory for testing.  Under normal circumstances, it is the CB-assigned auditor who must arrange and supervise  the  collection,  labeling,  and  shipment  to  a  qualified  Third-party  Laboratory,  of  samples  as described in this section.

## Auditor Guidance: (not auditable)

- A4 1.1 Auditors shall provide a narrative description of the process used to select samples, and any difficulties encountered in assembling the requisite number of samples.
- A4 1.2 Auditors must supply documentation associated with the samples collected, to include:
- · A copy of the plant inventory sheet in use on the day samples are collected, against which the selection of samples was made (supply as an Excel or Word file, or as a legible scanned file or photo)
- · List of samples collected, facility and laboratory details (as an Excel file), detailing the following:
- · Facility name and GSA ID number
- · Third-party laboratory name and contact details
- · Sampling date and times
- · Species (scientific name)
- · Primary Product Form description (per sample)
- · Alphanumeric Sample Code assigned by auditor - as written on sample bags (per sample)
- · Production lot ID or date code (per sample)
- · Description  of  product,  including  product  specifications  such  as  size  or  count, supplier code, etc. (per sample)

•

Photos of each sample collected, showing the assigned alphanumeric code and any other tracking information visible on the bag (per sample).

- · A description of how the samples were packed and shipped shall be provided to GSA.

Once testing has been completed, the laboratory must forward an original copy of the analytical results directly to the CB and GSA, with a copy to the facility. Results must be documented in the certification records, and CB's must supply GSA with copies of the test results.

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

If any positive results are detected in a composited sample, laboratories will be required to utilize the retained  portions  of  individual  samples  to  determine  which  production  lot(s)  were  the  cause  of  the positive results. Facilities shall launch an investigation into the root cause of such contamination, and document effective corrective actions to prevent future recurrences.  Positive test results will normally result  in  GSA  assigning  a  more  frequent  level  of  'Plant  Ongoing  Monitoring',  as  is  subsequently described in Section 3 of Annex 4.

## Auditable clauses:

- A4 1.4  The  auditor  shall  confirm  whether  the  tests  carried  out  by  the  Third-party  Laboratory  were complete, that the correct parameters were tested, using testing methods acceptable to GSA, and using the correct levels of sensitivity (LOQ's, MRPL's), as specified in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.
- A4 1.5  The auditor shall confirm whether the results from the tests on samples collected during the audit conform to the GSA limits stated in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.

## A4 2.0 During the Audit - Collection of Product Samples and Review of Test Results by CB-assigned Auditor When a Third-Party Has Been Assigned to Collect Samples

Only in cases where GSA has specifically notified the facility and the CB in advance that a Third-party Laboratory  or  GSA-approved  Sampler  must  be  present  during  the  audit,  will  the  sampling  process  be carried out by Third-party personnel. This will normally only occur when a facility has had a confirmed report of contamination in a shipment of finished products, such as might occur under USFDA, USDA, CFIA, EU, or other such competent authorities' testing programs, or when GSA sampling has resulted in a positive test result. If such notification has not been given to the facility or to the CB, this Section (Annex 4 Section 2) will be N/A.

When this sampling approach has been invoked, GSA will arrange for a Third-party Laboratory accredited to ISO 17025 or equivalent, or for a GSA-approved Sampler, to be present during the audit for the collection and transport of samples.

The auditor shall review production records to determine the types of products in active inventory and the quantity  of  each  (as  described  in  Annex  4  Section  1  above).  From  this  information  the  auditor  shall designate which lots shall be sampled.  The Third-party Laboratory or GSA-approved Sampler shall collect the samples from the lots the auditor designates.  The auditor shall supervise the collection of product samples during the GSA audit.  The documentation steps outlined in Annex 4 Section 1 above are to be followed.

The auditor shall provide the Third-party Laboratory or GSA-approved Sampler the Certification Body's contact information and email address for directly forwarding the test results to them in a timely fashion.

Once testing has been completed, the laboratory must forward an original copy of the analytical results directly to the CB and to GSA, with a copy to the facility. Results must be documented in the certification records, and the CB must supply GSA with copies of the test results.

Laboratories are required to partition incoming samples as needed for completing microbiological and drug testing as outlined in Annex 4, and a portion of each individual sample must be retained for follow-up testing, in case any positive result is detected in a composited sample .  In case of positive findings in a composited sample, laboratories must utilize the retained individual sample portions to determine which production lot(s) was the cause of the contamination. In cases of positive findings, facilities are required to launch an investigation into the root cause of the contamination, and document effective corrective actions to prevent future recurrences.  Positive test results will normally result in GSA assigning an accelerated frequency of 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring', as is subsequently described in Section 3 of Annex 4 and Annex

4 Tables I and II and Annex 4 Figure I. Plants will be responsible to pay for any additional testing costs in case such supplemental testing is required due to positive results being obtained in a composited sample.

## Auditable clauses (when Third-Party sampling has been invoked):

- A4 2.1  The  auditor  shall  record  the  name  and  contact  details  for  the  Third-party  Laboratory  or Sampling company, and the name of the staff member that collected the samples.
- A4 2.2  The  auditor  shall  confirm  whether  the  tests  carried  out  by  the  Third-party  Laboratory  were complete, that the correct parameters were tested, using testing methods acceptable to GSA, and using the correct levels of sensitivity (LOQ's, MRPL's), as specified in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.
- A4 2.3  The auditor shall confirm whether the results from the tests on samples collected during the audit conform to the GSA limits stated in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.

## A4 3.0 Once Certified - Plant Ongoing Monitoring

As with the 'During the Audit' sampling, only in cases where GSA has specifically notified the facility that a Third-party Laboratory or Sampler must be involved, will the sampling process be carried out by third-party personnel. This will normally only occur when a facility has had a confirmed incident of contamination in a shipment of finished products that tested positive for contamination, such as might occur under USFDA, USDA,  CFIA,  EU,  or  other  such  competent  authorities'  testing  programs.    If  such  GSA  has  not communicated in advance that a facility is to be following a more accelerated frequency of testing, the facility will themselves be responsible to collect samples for testing to be performed under this Section.

Facilities shall carry out Plant Ongoing Monitoring at the appropriate frequency as outlined in Annex 4 Table I. This is Quarterly for new facilities, and Semi-annually for facilities that have been in the GSA program for a long period without positive test results.  Facilities that have had repeated incidences of positive test results will be at a Monthly frequency of testing.  If additional positive test results occur for facilities that are on a Monthly frequency, they will be at risk of being Suspended from the GSA certification program (see the illustration of the 'escalation' process in Annex 4 Figure I).

Note: GSA allows the 'During the Audit' sampling and testing required under Section 2 of Annex 4 to  be  counted  towards  the  required  frequency  of  sampling  in  the  'Plant  Ongoing  Monitoring' requirement. (This means for example that if a plant is at the lowest frequency of 'Semi-Annual' sampling, they  fulfill  the  Sampling  requirement  by  conducting  one  set  of  sampling  and  testing  done  in  the  'Plant Ongoing  Monitoring',  and  the  second  set  by  the  sampling  and  testing  done  in  the  'During  the  Audit' monitoring.)

Sampling done under this category is to be conducted in the same manner as has been outlined in Section 1 of Annex 4 above. Facilities are to communicate the periodic results from such testing to the CB that conducted their most recent annual audit, as well as directly to the GSA.  Testing done for the sake of government  sampling  and  testing  programs  can  wholly  or  partially  be  counted  towards  meeting  this 'Ongoing Plant Monitoring' requirement, if such testing includes the same parameters as GSA, and has been conducted using sampling and testing procedures that are equivalent or stricter than what is specified by the GSA program.

Auditors shall verify that the facilities have been carrying out this 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' as required, and document the following points:

Document ID: PI1-0185 Document Name: Seafood Processing Standard Issue Number: 5.1 Effective Date: 16-January-2021

## Auditable clauses when the facility is doing 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' themselves:

- A4 3.1  What is the frequency of 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' the facility is using at the time of the audit? Does the  frequency  of  such  testing  conform  to  what  is  expected  for  the  facility  under  the requirements of Annex 4 Table I?
- A4 3.2  The  auditor  shall  confirm  whether  the  tests  carried  out  by  the  Third-party  Laboratory  were complete, that the correct parameters were tested, using testing methods acceptable to GSA, and using the correct levels of sensitivity (LOQ's, MRPL's), as specified in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.
- A4 3.3  The auditor shall confirm whether the results from the tests on samples collected during the audit conform to the GSA limits stated in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.
- A4 3.4  Were the results of 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' communicated to the CB and to the GSA as required?

## Auditable clauses when 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' is being done by a Third-Party Sampler:

- A4 3.5  What is the frequency of 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' the facility is using at the time of the audit? Does the  frequency  of  such  testing  conform  to  what  is  expected  for  the  facility  under  the requirements of Annex 4 Table I?
- A4 3.6  Did the Facility arrange for a Third-party Laboratory accredited to ISO 17025 or equivalent, or a Sampling Company recognized by GSA to collect samples as required?
- A4 3.7  The  auditor  shall  confirm  whether  the  tests  carried  out  by  the  Third-party  Laboratory  were complete, that the correct parameters were tested, using testing methods acceptable to GSA, and using the correct levels of sensitivity (LOQ's, MRPL's), as specified in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.
- A4 3.8  The auditor shall confirm whether the results from the tests on samples collected during the audit conform to the GSA limits stated in Annex 4 Tables II, III, or IV, as applicable.
- A4 3.9  Were the results of 'Plant Ongoing Monitoring' communicated to the CB and to the GSA as required?

## DEFINITIONS

- · Microbiological Criteria Criteria defining the acceptability of a product, a batch of food stuffs or a process based on the absence, presence or number of micro- organisms and/or on the quantity of their toxins/metabolites, per unit(s) of mass, volume, area or batch.
- · MRPL Minimum Required Performance Limits - minimum limits for analytical methods used for the detection of banned substances. MRPLs are set by the EU for substances that are banned/not allowed to be used. And have set this limit for the analytical method used for substances for which no safe permitted limit has been established.
- · LOQ Limit of Quantification. A laboratory analysing for substances for which an LOQ is stated must utilize an approved method that has a minimum performance level in keeping with the LOQ.
- · Residue analysis involves both screening and confirmatory methods for identifying residues include Gas Chromatography (GC), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/MS).

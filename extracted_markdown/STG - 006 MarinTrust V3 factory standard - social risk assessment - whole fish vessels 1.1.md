## About MarinTrust

MarinTrust is the leading independent business to business certification programme for the marine ingredients value chain. Responsible sourcing and manufacturing are vital if marine ingredients are to remain a relevant ingredient in feed for land animals and agriculture, pet care and directly in the production of consumer products, including cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Fishmeal and fish oil make up the largest share of marine ingredients today, however all marine ingredients are included in MarinTrust's scope .

To enable stakeholders to credibly demonstrate the commitment to responsible practice in areas of feed safety, raw material procurement, delivery, and throughout the production process, MarinTrust developed a robust Certification Programme, consisting of three main components:

-  The MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients: The verification and certification of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from approved fisheries and by-product species.
-  The MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard: The verification and certification of the chain of custody for marine ingredients (products) that come from MarinTrust certified factories along the value chain to the customer.
-  The Improver Programme: The verification and approval of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from accepted MarinTrust Improver fisheries.

## About risk assessment

Risk assessment provides a way for businesses to understand the landscape in which they operate. They are commonly used to help businesses identify where there may be issues, for example in a specific country or a specific supply chain.

Risk assessment is part of a 'toolkit' on due diligence. But it only provides an initial indication of risk. It is not a replacement for understanding specific supply chains or individual companies/suppliers within the supply chain.

Human rights risk assessments commonly cover three levels1:

- 1. Country level
- 2. Sectoral level
- 3. Company level

It is useful to start at the broad country level as this shows which countries may be associated with higher levels of human rights risks. Beyond that, companies can dive deeper into their own sectors and supply chains.

Risk assessment can use different measures and indicators, depending on what is relevant to include. And there are many different risk assessment methodologies available. However, many of these use common indicators.

## The MarinTrust social risk assessment

This MarinTrust social risk assessment combines country and sectoral level indicators i.e. indicators specific  at  both  the  country  and  seafood  levels.  The  indicators  (Table  1)  are  well  established  and commonly used in seafood specific risk assessments.

The method and the results are used in specific areas within the MarinTrust Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients (the factory standard). These are described in the following sections.

## Risk assessment methodology

A risk assessment methodology has been developed, using the indicators in Table 1.

Each of the five indicators in Table 1 is allocated a range of scores (0 to 4), with 0 the best score (Table 2) and 4 the worst. The total score of all five indicators provides an overall score, which provides the risk rating (Table 3).

## Table 2: Scoring criteria of each country risk indicator

## Table 3: Total risk scores and rating

| High           | Medium Risk      | Low Risk      |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Sum ≥ 5 points | Sum &gt;1&lt; 5 points | Sum ≤ 1 point |

The individual indicators are updated periodically, typically each year or as/when a new dataset is available. As such, scores will vary.

## Country risk ratings

Using the described methodology, each country achieves a total score and associated risk rating. See Annex 2 for full list of countries and ratings (correct at the time this document was produced).

Depending on which part of the Standard the country denotes either:

-  The flag state of the vessel supplying whole fish, or
-  The location of the production facility (factory).

Country risk scores and ratings can change depending on the performance of each indicator. Sores and ratings are updated annually, typically in June-July after the latest TIP report is issued. However, updates may be completed after other information sources are revised. A revised version of this document will be created to include the latest country ratings. This will be available from the MarinTrust website.

The country risk ratings are used as a starting point by the production facility. Depending on which part of the Standard is under consideration or the rating itself, the production facility will be required to take different actions, for example implement additional checks.

## Social risk assessment for vessels supplying whole fish

This section provides an overview of the requirements for social responsibility for vessels supplying whole fish directly to marine ingredient producers.

It is related to Section 2, Clause 2.11.2.1:

The facility shall complete and document the results of the MarinTrust Social Responsibility Risk Assessment for all vessels supplying whole fish.

## Rationale

Assurance is required from vessels supplying whole fish. This has always focused on the integrity of the raw material, but V3.0 has introduced additional requirements relating to the fishing crew.

The requirements for additional assurance from vessels supplying whole fish depends on the level of risk and type of vessel ownership. The assurance comes in the form of supplier agreements and the requirement for fishing vessels supplying whole fish to have a policy on social responsibility, covering a number of areas of effective social practice and human rights.

This section of the guidance provides information on what is required from vessels supplying wholefish.

## For auditing purposes:

-  Facilities are required to document the risk assessment results and the sourcing arrangements in place with vessels supplying whole fish.
-  Facilities must be able to show copies of vessel agreements to the auditor.
-  Facilities must be able to demonstrate they have agreements in place with vessels as applicable. These must include the relevant content.

## Part A: Risk rating for vessels supplying whole fish

All facilities which receive whole fish directly from fishing vessels shall start with identifying the risk rating of each vessel, based on the vessel flag state.

## The facility shall:

- 1. Compile a list of vessels from which whole fish are sourced.
- 2. Include the flag state of each vessel i.e. the country the vessel is officially registered in for commercial fishing.
- 3. Use the Table in Annex 2 to find the risk rating for each country or flag state.
- 4. Add the risk rating for each country to the collated list.
- o Where a rating is low , the facility is not required to take further action.
- o Where a rating is medium or high , the facility is required to go to the next stage of this assessment (Part B) .

The details for the vessels shall be documented as evidence for the auditor. See Annex 4 for an example of the information required.

## Part C: Assurance required from vessels not under existing agreements

If a facility is sourcing whole fish from a vessel and there is no existing supplier agreement with that vessel, this must be put in place.

For social accountability, vessels supplying whole fish shall include a social accountability selfdeclaration / policy which is communicated to all crew. This requirement is phased in over six years (two certification cycles) to enable a facility time to introduce the requirement with all vessels it sources from.

The agreement with each vessel shall include, as a minimum, the wording in Annex 3.

Agreements are required before accepting landings from each vessel. Noting that these agreements are phased in over time.

Timescale for introducing social accountability into agreements with vessels supplying whole fish The aim is that all vessels supplying whole fish will have a commitment to social responsibility in time. However annual targets are introduced to enable facilities time to meet this requirement.

By the end of the first 3-year certification cycle, the target is to achieve 50% of supplying vessels covered by such a policy / an agreement.

| Percentage of vessels included each year  (first certification cycle)   | Percentage of vessels included each year  (second certification cycle)   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yr 1 = 10%                                                              | Yr 4 = 66%                                                               |
| Yr 2 = 25%                                                              | Yr 5 = 85%                                                               |
| Yr 3 = 50%                                                              | Yr 6 = 100%                                                              |

## The audit

For the purposes of the audit, the auditor will check:

- 1. Whether the facility sources whole fish from fishing vessels.
- 2. That there is a full list of fishing vessels that the facility sources from. And for each vessel, the country they are registered to, and what the risk rating is.
- 3. Whether the fishing vessels:
- a. Are owned by the parent company that owns the marine ingredient facility.
- b. Have an existing agreement in place.
- 4. That supplier agreements are available from fishing vessels that include the social commitment.
- 5. That the number of agreements cover the required number of vessels for that year of the certification cycle.

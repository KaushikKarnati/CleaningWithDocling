## A Introduction

Product Identity  Preserved  (PIP)  foods  are  products  that  make  a  claim  related  to  the  status  of  a  food product or raw material. The Global Seafood Alliance Seafood Processing Standard allows eligible farm species to demonstrate documented linkages to Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) certified farms, as well as BAPcertified feed mills and/or hatcheries , to qualify for the BAP multi-star logo.

## B Scope

This module applies to both farmed and wild captured eligible species. This includes farmed multi star claims that are labeled, claimed, or sold in any way as 2, 3, or 4 star BAP product.

## C Product Identity Preservation Requirements

- PIP1 The  label  control  procedure  shall  include  a  procedure  for  the  proper  labelling  and downgrading  of  the  star  status  of  products.    In  the  event  the  facility  mixes  products  of different BAP star categories, the product can only claim the lowest star category. Records shall be maintained to demonstrate which products of different BAP star categories were mixed, and that the star status of resultant product was properly downgraded.
- PIP2 The facility shall assign a unique traceability code for products of each BAP star category, whether the BAP logo is used on packaging or not. This unique traceability code shall be assigned at receiving and carry forward through each step of production, packaging, and storage in order to easily identify and trace every lot of BAP 2, 3 and 4-star products from each other, and from non-BAP products.
- PIP3 All packaging, including finished product packaging and temporary product packaging , shall retain the original unique code and any subsequent codes assigned.
- PIP4 The  original  assigned  unique  traceability  codes  shall  be  transferred  to  the  shipping documents which are provided directly to the purchaser/buyer. All transactions in the supply chain must be linked to verify chain of custody. All sales from the processor through the supply chain, excluding the consumer, would retain the unique code. In addition, the shipping documents shall  include  the  breakdown  of  quantities  of  each  BAP  star  category  and  its unique code or lot number.
- PIP5 The facility shall record and provide evidence of a documented relationship with all BAP facilities to which the facility is linked for purposes of star status claims.
- PIP6 Mass balance shall be conducted for each star category that is being claimed. The facility shall demonstrate that they purchased enough raw material from each star level to produce the amount of finished product claimed for that star level for the last calendar year.
- PIP7 The facility shall conduct one trace forward and trace back exercise on the highest star product produced since the last GSA Seafood Processing Standard audit.

PIP8

The results of the trace-forward and trace back exercises shall be recorded. 100% accountability shall be achieved during the exercises.

PIP9

The results from the trace exercise shall be achieved in no more than one half-day (4 hours).

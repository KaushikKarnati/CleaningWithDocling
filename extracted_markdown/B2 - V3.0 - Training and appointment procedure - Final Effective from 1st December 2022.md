## 1.  Introduction

As a third-party Certification Programme, the MarinTrust Secretariat, on behalf of the Governing Body Committee,  appoints  third  party  accredited  Certification  Bodies  (CB)  to  carry  out  fishery  and  byproduct assessment and facility audits, and certification activities.

To  maintain  the  credibility,  integrity,  and  consistency  of  the  auditing  process,  the  MarinTrust Secretariat stipulates key criteria, requirements, and appointment process that CB personnel must comply with to provide such services.

## 2. Purpose and scope

This  document  outlines  key  MarinTrust  criteria,  requirements  and  process  for  the  appointment, training, and approval of CB personnel involved in the certification process including:

- · MarinTrust factory auditors (including IP)
- · MarinTrust Chain of Custody auditors
- · Technical Reviewers
- · Auditor trainers
- · Fishery assessors
- · Fishery Assessment Peer Reviewers
- · Fishery assessor trainers

The  requirements  and  procedures  stipulated  herein  are  applicable  to  both  contracted  and subcontracted personnel.

Note: This document does not include criteria of personnel carrying out fishery assessments on behalf of a Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) for the Improver Programme as they are not required to be affiliated with a registered CB. Instead, they should be suitably qualified in line with guidance in Doc IP1 of the Quality Management System (QMS).

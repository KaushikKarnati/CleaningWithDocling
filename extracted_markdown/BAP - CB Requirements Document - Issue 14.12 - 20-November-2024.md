The Seafood Processing Plant Standard's food safety component is Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) recognized. The format and content of each Standard are designed to allow an assessment of  a  company's  premises  and  operational  systems  and  procedures  by  a  competent  third-party ISO/IEC 17065 accredited Certification Body against the requirements of that individual Standard.

To ensure the integrity of the GSA Standards and the associated certification it was imperative for BAP to establish structures with defined responsibilities, procedures, and terms of reference.

As changes are made to this document, the Certification Bodies will be given 30 days to make necessary changes and adaptations. The time allocated to CBs in developing countries will be 60 days and with due consideration to capacity building by the BAP Management.

## 1.4 Standards Development and Ownership

The  GSA  Standards  have  been  developed  by  the  GSA  Standards  Technical  Committees.  Since January 2008, the GSA Standards Oversight Committee has overseen the standards development process and committee selection process. The Standards Oversight Committee membership is drawn from representatives of Industry, NGO's and Academia. The BAP Technical Committees manage the continued operational issues in relation to Standards. Each committee has their own Terms of Reference under which they conduct business.

The Standards remain the property of the Global Seafood Alliance.

## 1.5 BAP Program Management

Once  Standards  are  approved,  the  administration  of  the  BAP  Program  rests  with  the  Best Aquaculture Practices who act as Program Managers for the GSA. Best Aquaculture Practices approves and contracts Certification Bodies (CB) to carry out certification of the Applicants to the Program Standards. CBs are categorized as either Restricted Approved or fully Approved (See 3.3).

Best Aquaculture Practices is responsible for the official training of auditors and maintains a list of approved auditors from all CBs for the GSA Standards.

Best Aquaculture Practices conducts regular reviews of the operation of the scheme to protect program integrity and ensure compliance with the requirements of global standards including, as applicable, examples such as ISO/IEC 17065, ISO 17011, GFSI, etc. These reviews are conducted in multiple ways including internal audits, CB and auditor performance monitoring, consult with the GSA and SOC in Standards review and revision, and so forth.

## 1.6 Certification and Audit Scope

Certification of applicants wishing to be assessed against the GSA Standards is carried out by approved CBs. CBs assess the Applicant's facility and determine if the said facility meets all the requirements of the applicable Certification Standard.

The certification and audit scope of a facility for SPS audits would be 'Processing of Perishable Animal Products' which is per GFSI CI scope of industry sector as SPS is benchmarked to CI scope. This is the food safety pillar of the GSA-BAP Program. In addition, SPS has requirements from other pillars of the GSA-BAP Program - social, environmental, and animal welfare. These would also be audited within the scope selected.

Within the certification scope, the GSA Standards do not allow for exclusions in conducting audits of any facilities against any of the standards. All facilities seeking certification against any of the GSA Standards, and CBs performing assessments, must conduct a full audit against all parts of the  facility  and  eligible  species  and  product  forms  that  the  facility  produces.  All  applicable requirements of the standards must be audited as well.

The Seafood Processing Standard (SPS) does allow for a selection of scope for certification to farm raised product, wild caught, or both (see section 4.5); however, if a seafood processing facility is  processing  both  and  has  opted  for  only  one  category  (e.g.  farm  raised)  as  their  scope  of certification, they cannot restrict the auditor to enter the frozen storage for the other category (e.g. wild caught). The facility must allow access to such frozen storage areas, and it is for the auditor to determine whether the storage units can be excluded from the audit upon verification that the facility has stored only products from wild caught species and may in fact be excluded from the audit and certification.

The CBs who wish to gain approval to audit against the GSA Standards must fully understand their responsibility and role to provide assurances that required Standards are monitored and maintained.

These  Terms  of  Reference  will  include  CB  performance  review  and,  where  necessary,  Best Aquaculture Practices will draw to the attention of the CB and their Accreditation Body any matters requiring investigation or action.

## 2.0 Standards Background and Program Overview

## 2.1 Purpose

This document has been prepared by the BAP division of the GSA, the designated BAP Program Managers.

The purpose of the document is to ensure that CBs and Accreditation Bodies are fully aware of:

- · The role of the Best Aquaculture Practices
- · The importance of the GSA Standards
- · Their responsibility with respect to legal liability
- · The procedures supporting the GSA Standards and the obligation to comply with all requirements toward protection of the integrity of the scheme.

Significant efforts have been made to promote openness and transparency in the development and implementation  process  and  to  work  closely  with  all  stakeholders  to  ensure  the  integrity  and robustness of the system.

It is of the utmost importance that those involved with certification and accreditation are included in the continued development and implementation of the GSA Standards. This document will assist with the understanding of the aims of the GSA Standards and their significance.

## 2.2 Update to Standards, Protocols and Procedures

Best Aquaculture Practices will periodically issue new or revised requirements to this document, the GSA  Standards,  and/or  the  various  other  documents  supporting  the  Standards.  Best Aquaculture Practices shall make the CBs aware of these changes and the CB shall ensure these are  communicated  to  applicants  and  the  appropriate  staff,  auditors,  and  subcontract  auditors within their organization. The latest Issue of each Standard will be on the BAP website.

Standards will be identified by an Issue Number. When minor changes (housekeeping) are made to  a  Standard  this  may  result  in  a  subsequent  Revision  Number  e.g.,  Issue  1  Rev.  1.  CBs  are expected to be accredited to the most recent Issue Number.

When a significant change is made to a Standard the Issue Number will change. Applicants and CBs will be given adequate time to make necessary changes and adaptations.

## 2.3 Communications

With Certification Bodies: See 3.4.2.

With Applicants and Certified Sites: Best Aquaculture Practices may contact applicants or certified sites in order to request feedback with regard to the audit and certification process as part of the CB performance monitoring.

With  Accreditation  Bodies:  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  will  expect  to  have  open  channels  of communication with Accreditation Bodies and may share some data with Accreditation Bodies responsible  for  the  accreditation  of  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  approved  CBs.  CBs  will  be expected to facilitate open communication channels with Accreditation Bodies. This may include such items as complaints submitted to Best Aquaculture Practices that are considered to be

justified, or information resulting in suspension or withdrawal of CB approval by Best Aquaculture Practices. Accreditation

Bodies are also required to share information with Best Aquaculture Practices related to CB Compliance and / or notifications of suspension or withdrawal of a CB's accreditation.

## 3.0 Certification Body (CB) Requirements

## 3.1 CB Recognition by Best Aquaculture Practices

Certification Bodies wishing to apply for approval and recognition to audit against one or more of the GSA standards must first, as a pre-requisite, be accredited to the current version of the ISO/IEC 17065 standard with an Accreditation Body per 3.3.1 BEFORE applying to GSA. CBs must also be a  recognized  Member  Firm  with  the  Association  of  Professional  Social  Compliance  Auditors (APSCA).  Only  independent  third-party  Certification  Bodies  not  associated  with  government regulatory  bodies  will  be  accepted  as  CBs  to  audit  conformity  of  facilities  against  the  GSA standards.  CBs  wishing  to  seek  recognition  must  formally  request  Best  Aquaculture  Practices confirming  their  intention  and  submit  a  registration  form.  The  CBs  shall  state  which  of  the Standards they are requesting approval for. If the registration meets the BAP Requirements, the CB will be sent additional materials to initiate the application process.

Certification Bodies will be given 'Restricted Approval' status for each Standard until they achieve full accreditation status for each specific Standard Issue. During this time the CB will be given a restricted number of audits to allow them to gain accreditation.

Note: In addition, once a CB has been approved by BAP, that CB must also seek an extension to scope of their ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation to include the GSA Seafood Processing Standard and other  relevant  GSA  Standard(s).  The  CB  will  remain  on  a  Restricted  CB  Approval  List  for  each Standard until the CB has become accredited for that Standard scope. Once accreditation has been achieved the CB will move to a 'Fully Approved' listing. See 3.3 and 3.4 for more details.

CB Applicants must meet all requirements of this and other relevant BAP documents, including but not  limited  to  the  competency  and  training  requirements  of  Certification  Body  personnel  and individual Auditors related to the specific seafood categories covered under GSA.

Only Certification Bodies that are registered and formally recognized by Best Aquaculture Practices are authorized to conduct audits against any of the GSA Standards. Any and all offices that offer and  make  certification  decisions,  and/or  issue  certification  to  GSA  Standards  shall  be  duly registered with Best Aquaculture Practices.

Approval of a Certification Body will only take place if their Accreditation Body is recognized by Best Aquaculture Practices. See 3.3.

The CB will have a named representative responsible for dealing with all aspects of GSA Standards, Certification and Accreditation and these persons shall be named on the registration form. In the event that a named representative leaves the employment of the CB, Best Aquaculture Practices shall be informed accordingly and provided with the name and details of the replacement.

Best Aquaculture Practices recognizes the importance of accreditation and during the development of all the Standards and Certification Process it has consulted with (IAF) national accreditation bodies and experienced CBs to ensure that all the requirements of product/process certification are met.

## 3.3 CB Accreditation Body Requirements, and Accreditation Scope Extension to BAP

There are two levels of CB approval for each Standard:

- 1) Restricted CB Approval Listing - for CBs seeking accreditation extensions of scope for specific Standards. This 'Restricted' level allows the CB enough assessments to gain accreditation.
- 2) Full  Approval  Listing  -  for  CBs  which  have  gained  accreditations  for  the  specific standards.

The BAP Team will maintain an up-to-date list of CB Approval listings for each category.

## 3.3.1 CB's Accreditation Body

The CBs Accreditation Body shall be a member of the IAF (International Accreditation Forum) and a signatory to the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA). CBs registering/applying for BAP recognition shall disclose at that time whether or not they are aware of any circumstances that  would  reasonably  or  may  reasonably  lead  to  the  withdrawal  or  suspension  of  their Accreditation. GSA shall have an open communication channel with the Accreditation Body as part of the arrangement with the CB.

## 3.3.2 Accreditation Extension to Scope against the GSA-BAP Standard(s)

As stated under 3.1, accreditation by a recognized AB to ISO/IEC 17065 is a pre-requisite for any CB to apply for recognition to BAP. Once a CB has been approved for listing by BAP, that CB must also seek an extension to scope of their ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation to include the GSA Seafood Processing Standard and the relevant GSA Standard(s). The CB will be put on a 'Restricted CB Approval List' until each specific extension of accreditation scope has been achieved.

Best Aquaculture Practices recognizes that to achieve an extension to their scope of accreditation, CBs must be able to carry out evaluations against the Standard(s) they are seeking approval for. Therefore, a CB shall be allowed to carry out BAP audits, on a restricted number basis, prior to achieving accreditation extension, where they can demonstrate the following.

- · An active application for an extension to scope against ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation to include the GSA Standard(s).
- · Accreditation scope extension must be expected within a target of 12 months of the date of application to the Accreditation Body. An Accreditation plan shall be submitted to the BAP Team.
- · Compliance with scheme and competency requirements.

Should accreditation to the scope of the GSA Seafood Processing Standard and/or other Standards not be granted within the time frame specified above, the CB's approval shall be reviewed based on a formal risk assessment, and the CB shall resubmit a plan to the GSA for approval to achieve accreditation. GSA will decide on of the following after consultation with the relevant Accreditation Board:

- · Allowance of a further set amount of time to gain accreditation.
- · Termination of contract.

A CB which has accreditation extension for a given standard will remain in Full Approval for 12 months after the publication of a new issue of the standard. After that period the approval rating of the CB will move from Full to Restricted and the CB's contract will be reviewed.

## 3.4 Accreditation and Membership Status

CBs seeking Full Approval Listing to assess against any GSA Standard must supply a copy of their ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation certificate to BAP. The CB shall only be placed on the Restricted CB List when it has applied for a new scope extension to a specific Standard(s).

A  CB  shall  only  be  placed  on  the  Full  Approval  List  for  a  new  Standard  when  it  has  gained, accreditation for that specific standard. A copy of the accreditation certificate shall be provided to Best Aquaculture Practices, with reference to the version number or date of the Standard(s) made.

The CB shall make Best Aquaculture Practices immediately aware of any change of accreditation status or changes to ownership, management structure, of staff involved in the BAP certification process.

CBs will maintain membership for itself and any of its auditors performing services hereunder with the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (APSCA), and any other organization as reasonably required by GSA at GSA's discretion.

The Certification Body shall have a publicly available and clear listing on their website of the range of accredited BAP certification services and what BAP certification services are not.

## 3.4.1 Scope of Expertise

CBs shall only work within the specific fields of expertise relating to the BAP seafood categories for  which  they  are  approved.  CBs  must  demonstrate  that  their  staff  has  the  knowledge  and expertise to work within these fields. CBs must also demonstrate appropriate training for auditors has been undertaken before requesting an extension to scope of an auditor's approval categories.

Note:  Categories/fields  of  expertise  under  the  BAP  pertain  to  the  scope  of  the  Standards,  i.e., seafood experience in categories: farms, hatcheries, feed mills, and seafood processing plants. Refer to the 'BAP Auditor Competency and Course Approval Requirements' document where the specific BAP competency categories are defined.

The importance of fields of evaluation and auditor competence cannot be over emphasized and for Best Aquaculture Practices, their members, and other users, these are critical criteria, which are essential to support a legal due diligence defense.

## 3.4.2 Communication

Best  Aquaculture  Practices  welcomes  CB  communications  and  information  exchange.  Best Aquaculture  Practices  will,  from  time  to  time,  seek  CB  input  into  the  GSA  Standards,  related documents, and audit process.

The CB must warrant and communicate to Best Aquaculture Practices that:

- · Any  and  all  offices that offer and  make  certification  decisions,  and/or  issue certification to GSA shall be duly registered with Best Aquaculture Practices.
- · Each auditor is qualified to perform the audit services he/she performs on behalf of the  company  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set  our  herein  and  other  related  BAP documents and has complied with all training and competency requirements.
- · It maintains an accurate record of the qualifications of each auditor and the training undertaken by such auditors.
- · All factual information supplied to Best Aquaculture Practices and/or the Accreditation Body by the company is, or was when given, true, accurate and not misleading.
- · The  CB  has  the  power  and  all  necessary  consents,  licenses,  and  registrations  to conduct their business and to enter into and perform the contract; and;
- · The CB has read, understood, and shall comply with their obligations and requirements as laid out in this document and other BAP documents.

The Certification Body (CB) must demonstrate that it will carry out audits:

- · With all due diligence, skill, and care.
- · In accordance with the relevant Standard(s).
- · In accordance with any conditions attached to their Accreditation and only in respect of the BAP Categories for which they are approved.
- · Using only auditors who are trained and registered with Best Aquaculture Practices and meet the competencies of each of the relevant Standard(s) for undertaking such audits.

## 3.5 Extensions to Scope of BAP Recognition of Certification Bodies

Where a BAP recognized/approved Certification Body wishes to extend their scope to include a new  GSA  Standard,  the  request  for  an  extension  to  the  scope  or  recognition  will  need  to  be submitted to Best Aquaculture Practices. BAP will acknowledge and hold written notification from the CB of such a circumstance. The process for extending the scope of CB assessment is the same as for initial registration.

## 3.6 Management of Certification

## 3.6.1 Transfer of Certifications when facilities switch between GFSI-recognized Certification Programs.

Facilities certified to other GFSI benchmarked programs 1  may request to switch their certification to the GSA-Program. Since other GFSI benchmarked programs do not address the full scope of all GSA standard pillars, a scope evaluation is required.  Criteria within this section describes how this may be achieved.

Any such transfer request will be communicated and agreed upon by the facility, the CB, and BAP.

Certification Bodies shall conduct an evaluation before accepting the facilities into BAP Program. The evaluation must include, but is not limited to the following:

- · The facility's audit history
- · Validity and terms of the certification being transferred
- · Details of previous announced and unannounced audits of the certification being transferred

- · Ensuring the CB is accredited to the facility's scope of certification and product category
- · Ensuring CB auditors are approved to the scope of the GSA standard for which the certification is being transferred
- · Complaints and/or grievances made against the facility during the current certification cycle
- · Whether the facility has had food safety issues in its current certification cycle such as failed product testing or listing on international Import Alerts/ Refusals (e.g. US FDA Import Refusal)
- · Whether product sampling and testing under the current certificate meets GSAtesting requirements
- · Ensuring that, either through certification transfer or follow up audit, that the facility is in full compliance to the entire scope of the GSA standard for which it being transferred to, and how and when this can be verified.

The CB shall obtain and review, under consent by the facility, the following documents:

- · Full audit report of the current certification
- · Non-conformities and the associated corrective action documentation
- · Current GFSI benchmarked program certificate
- · Product and effluent test reports, if available.

Upon  completion  of  the  evaluation,  the  CB  shall  determine  whether  the  request  for  certificate transfer  is  to  be  accepted,  denied,  or  whether  a  supplemental  audit  is  necessary  for  further assessment.  This shall be communicated to BAP.

If a supplemental audit is required, the audit process, including disposition of NCs if applicable, shall be conducted per the Supplementary Audit Policy 2

Once the certificate transfer has been accepted by the CB, the current certificate issued by the existing CB will be valid until the expiration stated on the certificate.

## 3.6.2 Transfer of GSA-BAP Certifications between CBs

There may be circumstances where a certificate needs to be transferred from one GSA-approved CB to another CB prior to start of a certification cycle, or a facility may make a request to the CB and GSA for such transfer.

Under this scenario:

- · All non-conformities from a previous audit and/or investigations under the current certificate must be closed.
- · The certification must be in good standing without any current or pending suspensions/withdrawals.
- · Any ongoing Program Integrity investigation initiated by GSA must be completed before any such transfer can be made.

Competency and Course Requirements' document. That is, the CB must first verify that the above competency requirements have been met for the new category. This includes the experience and training  requirements,  attending,  and  passing  a  BAP  course,  and  undergoing  of  the  required training/shadow and witness audits described below in 3.8.1.

## 3.8 CB Auditor Experience

## 3.8.1 Initial Audit Experience - Shadow and Witness Audit Requirements

Note:  See  3.10  for  the  competency  requirements  of  the  assessor  conducting  the  shadow  and witness audits.

Once an auditor has met the competency requirements and passed the BAP auditor course, they are not fully approved to audit on their own until they have successfully completed a series of supervised shadow and a final sign off (witness) audits against the relevant GSA Standard/competency category to the CB's satisfaction. The number of shadow and witness audits per BAP category are as noted below.

CBs shall conduct more than the minimum number where the auditor performance during shadow and/or witness assessment indicates the auditor is not ready for approval and needs additional training and supervision. This is particularly relevant for auditor candidates that qualified almost entirely on industry/practical experience with no auditing experience.

'Shadow' audits are audits where training, discussion and direction can be provided to the auditor in training. In these audits the auditor-in-training passively observes (without interference to the audit process and/or the outcome of the audit) the already approved BAP auditor (Lead Auditor) conducting the audit. Based on the auditing experience of the auditor-in-training, the BAP approved auditor  may  assign  some  auditing  tasks  to  the  auditor-in-training  (these  are  sometimes  called observation audits by the CBs - this varies from CB to CB). However, the responsibility of the audit entirely  rests  with  the  Lead  Auditor,  including  audit  reporting,  verification  of  CA  evidence  and closure of NCs.

'Witness' audits are audits where the final sign-off of the auditor-in-training occurs so he/she can audit independently. Therefore, the auditor-in-training must conduct the entire audit by himself/herself with no direction or commentary from the witness assessor. The witness assessor only  observes  and  documents  the  witness  audit  outcome.  Based  on  the  report  with  all  of  the information and the witness assessor's recommendation, the CB makes the decision, if the auditor is to be signed off and given final approval to audit on his/her own as Lead Auditor (independently) or undergo more shadow audits and another sign off (witness audit).

For  Seafood  Processing  Plants: After  passing  the  BAP  course,  newly  approved  auditors  must successfully  complete  a  series  of  supervised  training  (shadow  audits)  and  a  final  'sign  off' (witness  audit)  conducted  on  site  at  a  number  of  different  plants  against  the  GSA  Seafood Processing Standard. The total number and duration of these audits shall be a minimum of 10 audit days and 5 audits. Every shadow/witness audit shall be conducted by an assessor that meets the competencies  defined  in  3.10.  BAP  will  accept  up  to  two  GFSI  'C1'  (Processing  of  Animal Perishable  Products,  which  presently  includes  us,  FSSC  22000,  GRMS,  SQF,  IFS,  and  BRC) benchmarked  scheme  shadow/witness  audits  as  equivalent  to  BAP  shadow  witness  audits. Shadow audits conducted to the standards of other GFSI recognized schemes for category C1 Processing  of  Animal  Perishable  Products  and  conducted  at  a  processing  plant  for  animal perishable products can also count toward the shadow audit requirements but not the final 'sign

off' (witness audit). If BAP accepts two GFSI C1 audits, the auditor will be required to complete two BAP shadow audit and one BAP final sign off witness audit.

For Auditors Meeting the Combined Competency Requirements for Farms and Hatcheries:

As  described  above,  for  a  total  of  2  (1  shadow,  1  witness),  conducted  on  site  at  a  number  of different facilities (e.g. 2 farms, or 2 hatcheries, or 1 farm and 1 hatchery) against a relevant GSA farm  or  hatchery  standard.  (The  similarity  in  farm  and  related  hatchery  competencies  are recognized and therefore allowed to overlap / replace one another for the purposes of Shadow / Witness).  The  relevant  BAP  standard  shall  be  in  compliance  with  the  auditor  competency categories  as  described  in  'BAP  Auditor  Competency  and  Course  Approval  Requirements' document. The auditor shall then be signed off, where competency has been demonstrated. Every shadow / witness audit shall be conducted by an assessor that meets the competencies defined in 3.10.

## 3.8.2 Submittal to BAP of Documented Proof of Final Auditor Sign off by the CB

The CB shall document the dates, duration, and location of the supervised shadow and witness audits described above along with their outcome. The CB shall submit to BAP this document or spreadsheet  showing  the  status  and  progress  of  shadow  and  witness  audit  activities  at  BAP Request.

In any case, the CB shall submit to BAP, in writing, the notice of final approval of the auditor and the complete shadow and witness history upon final CB approval. This is required with or without BAP request. This information is necessary for BAP to maintain verification records of the auditor competency and in order to update the BAP auditor status records from 'pending shadow and witness' to 'approved.' The shadow and witness assessments must include specific comments by the witness auditor assessing the trainees attributes and competencies as described in Section 3.8.5 of this document regarding their professional conduct during the audit. Refer to section 3.8.5 for specific examples of expected auditor attributes.

## 3.8.3 Maintain Audit Experience

The  CB  shall  have  in  place  an  annual  program  to  maintain  experience  in  the  relevant  GSA standard(s).

Seafood Processing Plants: To include at least 5 on site audits annually at a number of different organizations,  against  the  GSA  Seafood  Processing  Standard.  In  specific  situations  where  this requirement cannot be met, the CB shall ensure that auditors complete at least 5 on site audits against  a  GFSI  approved  standard,  and  at  least  one  on  site  audit  against  the  GSA  Seafood Processing Standard annually.

Farm/Hatcheries: At least 2 farm audits annually for each of the GSA farm/hatchery competency categories the auditor is approved for. As described in the 'BAP Auditor Competency and Course Requirements' document.

Feed Mills: At least 1 per year to the GSA Feed Mill Standard and/or any credible International Feed Standard/Scheme.

## 3.8.4 Continuing Training, Refresher Training, and Competency Monitoring

BAP approved auditors shall attend a BAP auditor course for refresher training in the categories they are approved for at a minimum, every 3 years. The auditor will need to attend the refresher training course by either June 30 th  or December 31 st  of the respective 3 rd year.

If an auditor attends initial BAP auditor training course from January-June in year one, they must attend the 3-year refresher training course by June 30 th  of year three. If they do not attend the refresher training course, they will become inactive and suspended effective July 1 st .

If an auditor attends initial BAP auditor training course from July-December in year one, they must attend the 3-year refresher training course by December 31 st  of year three. If they do not attend the refresher training course, they will become inactive and suspended effective January 1 st .

If  an  auditor  does  not  attend  the  refresher  training  course  by  the  respective  deadline,  they  will become inactive and suspended immediately according to the dates mentioned above and will remain inactive and suspended until attending and passing the next training course. If an auditors' credentials do lapse, they will have to register for the next training course as a 'new' auditor and be subject to the new auditor pricing. They will not need to complete the respective shadow/witness training though.

Auditors shall attend refresher training more often where the CB determines, during performance monitoring and calibration, that the auditor needs refresher training sooner. CBs shall promptly notify BAP where an auditor is unable to attend the required refresher training by the 3-year date. In such cases the auditor may be suspended until such time as the refresher training is successfully completed, depending on circumstances.

The auditor must be kept up to date with category best practice, and have access to and be able to, apply relevant laws and regulations.

Auditors  shall  undergo  additional  training  by  the  CB  whenever  a  new  version  of  the  GSA Standard(s), checklist, policies, guidance documents, etc. are issued. The CB shall maintain written records of all relevant training undertaken. It is the responsibility of the CB to ensure any auditor they  are  using  undergoes  proper  and  effective  training  in  between  attending  full  BAP  auditor refresher courses.

Training and monitoring shall also include calibration across auditors and to the Standard(s), report reviews and comparisons, and so on.

Auditors shall be subjected to periodic testing by Best Aquaculture Practices against the relevant BAP Standard in addition to course attendance, at BAP discretion.

Note: It is STRONGLY advised that CBs use a non-local (out of country) auditor every third time, or whenever auditor performance may be questionable, to prevent potential local bias from affecting the integrity of the audit outcome. (Combining audits to save cost when flying someone in should be done where possible).

## 3.12 Competency Requirements for Assessors Used by CBs to Conduct BAP Training/Shadow and Witness Audits

For BAP related training/shadow and witness auditing: the training/shadow and witness audits performed against the BAP scheme by the CB are crucial in protecting the integrity of the scheme by  ensuring  the  competency  and  proper  interpretation  of  the  Standard(s)  by  the  auditor  under assessment. For that reason, CBs are required to ensure that personnel they use to conduct such training/shadow and witness audits under BAP have a high level of experience and proper training in order to ensure the robustness of these assessments.

## 3.12.1 Training/Shadow and Witness Assessor Training and Reporting

The CB shall ensure the personnel conducting assessment audits of other BAP auditors have been properly trained in conducting such assessments. The CB shall further ensure that a report format, checklist  or  template  is  provided  for  documenting  the  assessment  outcomes  for  all  relevant categories. The report shall include, but is not necessarily limited to:

- · The facility where the assessment is taking place and the type of facility (farm, plant, etc.)
- · Whether or not the audit is a training/shadow/observation audit, or a witness audit.

## 3.14 Bribery and Fraud

This  policy  has  been  developed  to  establish  controls  defining  ethical  and  acceptable  auditor behavior before, during and after the auditing process of a facility. The ethics of BAP auditors and approved Certification Bodies is at the heart of program integrity.

This policy applies to all BAP approved auditors and Certification Bodies that conduct third party assessments for the Global Seafood Alliance BAP Certification Program.

All BAP approved auditors and Certification Bodies are expected to conduct themselves with the utmost ethical behavior. Auditors shall immediately report to their CB any attempts by a facility to offer  gifts,  money,  or  personal  favors  to  garner  favorable  results  in  the  certification  process. Certification  Bodies  are  to  immediately  inform  the  GSA  Program  Integrity  Department  of  any reported fraudulent, or unethical behavior reported by their auditor.

Auditors shall not accept offers including, but not limited to:

- · Money
- · Personal favors
- · Tickets or access to events
- · Items of material value
- · Off-site meals: It is reasonable for a facility to provide an auditor lunch on site during the assessment, but inappropriate for an auditor to go out with representatives from the facility being audited off premises

Any  claims  by  a  facility  regarding  misconduct  by  an  auditor,  such  as  demanding  a  bribe  for  a favorable audit, shall be investigated by the Certification Body in conjunction with the GSA Program Integrity Department.

It  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Certification  Body  to  investigate  and  ultimately  decide  on disciplinary actions for their employees, or contracted auditors who are accused and or determined to  be  guilty  of  fraud,  bribery,  or  unethical  behavior.  The  results  of  the  Certification  Bodies investigation shall be reported to the GSA Program Integrity Manager.

Facilities  who  are  accused  of  bribery  or  providing  false  documentation  to  an  auditor  shall  be investigated by the BAP Program Integrity Department with the full cooperation of the Certification Body. Ultimately, it shall be the responsibility of the BAP Program Integrity Manager to determine actions against facilities accused of and/or determined to be guilty of unethical behavior, up to and including termination from the BAP Certification Program.

Investigation  results  shall  not  be  disclosed  or  discussed  with  anyone  other  than  those  with  a legitimate  need  to  know.  This  is  to  protect  the  reputation  of  those  who  may  be  accused,  but ultimately found innocent of wrongdoing.

## 4.0 The Audit Process

## 4.1 Information to Applicants

The CB shall ensure the Applicant has or is provided with all relevant and up-to-date information related to the GSA standard(s) including the standard(s) themselves, any interpretation guidelines, and relevant audit policies.

The Certification Body shall also require that each applicant:

- · Always complies with the relevant provisions of the certification program
- · Makes  all  necessary  arrangements  for  the  conduct  of  the  evaluation,  including examination of documents, access to areas, records, personnel, etc.
- · Make claims regarding certification only in respect of the scope for which certification has been granted (see 1.6 'Certification and Assessment Scope').
- · Does not use its certification in such a manner as to bring the CB, BAP Management or any  other  associated  organizations  into  disrepute  and  does  not  make  any statements regarding its certification that the CB may consider to be misleading or unauthorized
- · Upon suspension or withdrawal  of  certification,  discontinues  use  of  all  advertising material that contains any reference thereto and returns any certification documents as required by the CB and Best Aquaculture Practices

## 4.2 Audit Frequency

It is the responsibility of the Applicant facility to maintain valid certification. Generally, the audit frequency for audits against all GSA Standards is once every 12 consecutive calendar months from the date of the initial audit and not the date of the issue of certificate by the CB or date of the BAP validation letter. (Also refer 4.13 - Certificate Validity for further explanation on audit frequency and certification cycle).

Recertification audits must occur per KPIs stated under 5.2. This provides for sufficient time for the submission of corrective actions and closure of nonconformities, if any, and does not affect continued certification. Audits must not occur beyond the abovementioned window as this would affect the certification cycle as well as other program related aspects.

Under  extreme  circumstances  of  'Force  Majeure'  like  weather  events,  public  safety  situations, natural calamities, events that does not allow auditors to travel due to country cross-border close downs, etc., the CBs and/or facilities must formally request the BAP for a written approval to issue a  temporary  extension  to  the  recertification  audit  timeframe  stated  above  and  the  certificate expiration date. In situations that require a permanent change to the recertification audit date, a prior written approval by the BAP Management to the CB and the facility is a must and the facility's new recertification date may be changed. In such a case the new recertification date will be the new initial certification audit date going forward. The timeframe of the temporary extension is to be agreed upon by the CB and BAP Management.

The only exception to the 12-month recertification audit rule is for GSA Salmon Farms Standard under the Group Program where audits occur on a biennial frequency starting from the initial audit date.  In this case a surveillance audit is required at the end of 12 consecutive calendar months from the initial audit date.

In circumstances where the CB technical review committee or CB Certification Committee finds an additional nonconformity upon review of the audit documentation, and/or if the results of effluent and/or product test reports leads to the issue of an additional nonconformity, the CB must issue a temporary  extension  to  the  recertification  audit  timeframe  (stated  above)  and  the  certificate expiration date. The timeframe of the temporary extension is to be agreed upon by the CB and BAP Management.

## 4.2.1 Audit Frequency for Seasonal Facilities

There  are  situations  of  seasonality  where  the  certification  cycle  might  be  affected.  Seasonal processing/production activities are those major production activities that facilities conduct during a short time period of not more than 4 to 5 consecutive calendar months in a 12-month period.

A facility that is open all 12 calendar months per year that processes or produces different products based on different seasonal product availability would not be considered a Seasonal Facility since they operate continuously year-round.

Initial certification and subsequent recertification audits for facilities that are involved in seasonal processing/production activities shall be completed within the operational window of the seasonal production. For example, a seafood processing plant processing product only during winter (some crabbing  facilities/activities  or  lobster  processing  activities)  would  need  to  have  its  audit completed  in  the  winter  while  processing  under  normal  operations.    CBs  and  facilities  must carefully schedule audits so that certifications do not lapse.

In situations where there is a significant temporary change in seasonal facility processing/production  operations  that  would  affect  the  recertification  audit  timeframe,  the

Certification Body and the seasonal facility must formally request from BAP a written approval to issue a temporary extension to the recertification audit timeframe.  The timeframe of the temporary extension  is  to  be  agreed  upon  by  the  CB  and  BAP  Management.    In  situations  that  require  a permanent change to the recertification audit timeframe, the Certification Body and the seasonal facility  must  formally  request  a  prior  written  approval  from  BAP.  In  such  a  case  the  new recertification date will be the new initial certification audit date going forward. Non-conformities issued at the seasonal facilities must be closed out per policies stated in 4.7.

## 4.3 Unannounced Audits (under GFSI benchmark - SPS)

Per  GFSI  benchmark  requirements,  facilities  certifying  under  the  GSA  Seafood  Processing Standard  (SPS)  must  undergo  one  unannounced  audit  every  three  years.  These  unannounced audits  shall  be  planned  and  conducted  by  the  CB.  The  criteria  detailed  below  applies  for  all unannounced audits.

## 4.3.1 Timing of Unannounced Audits

Initial audits of new facilities shall not be unannounced. Initial unannounced audit years shall be confirmed during the recertification application process and requirements shall be agreed upon as stated herein. Once an initial unannounced year is determined, subsequent unannounced audits must be conducted at least once every three-year period. Dates of unannounced audits during corresponding audit cycles shall be determined by the assigned CB. During the unannounced audit cycle the CB shall give notice to the facility that an unannounced audit is pending. Said notification shall:

- · be made by the CB more than ninety calendar days prior to the certificate expiration date.
- · initiate finalization of any agreements and communications required between the CB and the facility to conduct the audit.
- · specify a 60-day window in which the unannounced audit shall take place.
- · communicate to  the  facility  that  adequate  personnel  must  be  available,  during  normal business operating hours, within the 60-day window stipulated for the audit.

Once the communication as cited above is made by the CB to the facility, the facility may elect to request  a  black-out  period  of  two  weeks  (14  calendar  days)  within  the  60-day  window  to accommodate shut-down periods, non-production days, or annual maintenance that the facility might have to undertake. Such request by the facility should be made within 10 calendar days of the notice by the CB described above. Such black-out period must be agreed upon by the CB and the facility.

All pre-audit communications shall cease within 80 calendar days prior to the certificate expiration date. If unforeseen circumstances require additional communications within this time frame, the ability to conduct the recertification audit before the certificate expiration date may be impacted, and all such communications shall be cc'd to GSA Program Integrity.

Unannounced audits must not take place on weekends (or holy/religious days) or official holidays in the region where the facility is located. For seasonal facilities, the 60-day window may be reduced at the discretion of the CB to accommodate seasonal variations.

## 4.3.2 Unannounced Audit Operational Criteria

All unannounced audits shall be conducted either on-site or as a blended audit. Remote audits do not  qualify  for  unannounced  audits.  Unannounced  audits  shall  be  conducted  to  the  standard version to which the facility applied to.

If the  facility denies  the  CB  Auditor  access  to  the  site,  the  facility's  certificate  may  be suspended/withdrawn at the discretion of the CB. The CB must immediately inform GSA. If, due to justifiable reasons (valid reasons beyond the control of the facility), the facility cannot accept the unannounced audit when the auditor arrives at the facility, the auditor shall notify the CB for a determination as to whether the audit may continue or be rescheduled. Rescheduling of the audit makes the unannounced audit invalid. The CB shall inform BAP of any such outcome.

Auditors shall be trained by CBs in unannounced audit protocols. All KPIs and timelines for report submission,  NC  closures,  technical  reviews  and  certification  decisions  are  similar  to  that  of announced audits. 'Certification' and 'No-certification' decision by the CB also shall be determined in a similar manner as that of announced audits.

## 4.3.3 Unannounced Audit Process

Duration  and  process  of  unannounced  audits  shall  be  similar  to  that  of  announced  audits  as specified  in  the  CB  Requirements  document.  Unannounced  audits  shall  follow  the  process  as outlined in the 'Unannounced Audit Policy for SPS Audits' document.

## 4.3.4 Audit Reports and Certification

Audit reports and certificates issued by the CB following a successful unannounced audit must clearly  identify  that  the  audit  was  'Unannounced'  in  addition  to  specifications  in  the  relevant sections of this document. Limited scope, supplemental, or re-audits necessitated based on results of unannounced audits shall be announced unless otherwise specified by GSA.

## 4.4 Audit Duration

Refer to the GSA Audit Duration Policy 3 .

## 4.5 Audit Format

The CB shall be mindful that the audit format consists of systems review, documentation and records  review,  and  physical  inspection  of  the  site  and  production  processes.  Time  allocation during the audit shall be such as to provide sufficient and proportionate time for each activity to be carried out in full. Where appropriate, additional time may be granted for investigations. Formal requests to  extend  allocated  audit  durations  must  be  made  by  the  CB  to  BAP  in  writing.  Such requests shall not exceed 25% of the time initially allocated for the audit in question.

## A. CB responsibilities prior to audit.

- · Review of the facility application to ensure the scope, products, and processes are properly defined and to include resolution of any questions, unclear or missing information prior to assessment.
- · Audit duration is accurate per the scope the facility applied for.
- · Audit preparation, planning and scheduling, including assignment of a qualified auditor that is available within a reasonable time frame.
- · Where possible, preliminary document assessment in advance.

## B. Required auditing elements.

- · Opening meeting
- · Site assessment
- · Collection of necessary Samples for Testing
- · Review of Management systems, records, documents, and procedures
- · Employee interviews
- · Traceability exercises
- · Review of non-conformities identified and prepare NC report
- · Closing meeting
- · Provision of a non-conformance summary to the facility and CB
- · The auditor will complete a formal audit report

All  sections  of  the  standard  shall  be  covered  by  reviewing  the  Applicant  facility's  documents, records, and related procedures, together with an inspection of production facilities.

## C. Seafood Processing Plants

With publication of the Seafood Processing Standard Issue 5.0, facilities that produce both  farm  raised  and  wild  caught  species  have  an  option  to  choose  the  scope  of certification to be either: i) 'only farm raised', ii) 'only wild caught' or iii) 'both farm raised and wild caught' species categories. The auditor shall witness products and processes listed below per scope of the applicant facility during the assessment.

The scope of certification is detailed below.

- 1. Only farm raised - must be processing at least one farm raised species.
- 2. Only wild caught - must be processing at least one wild caught.
- 3. Both farm raised and wild caught - must be processing at least one species from either of the categories (farm raised and/or wild caught).

In  addition  to  the  criteria  stated  for  points  1-3  above,  the  auditor  must  witness,  if  available, production  processes  for  RTE  products  and  high-risk  processes  per  the  scope  of  certification elected by the facility. If the facility has such below stated RTE production processes within the scope of certification but does not have production during the initial audit, the auditor shall note

this in the audit report and the CB shall inform the facility that a supplemental audit is necessary to  review  the  production  of  such  products  and  their  HAACP/food  safety  and  other  related documentation before it can be included in the scope of current certification.

Examples of RTE products and high-risk processes (not an exhaustive list):

- · Processes involving Scombrotoxin formation.
- · Processes involving Clostridium botulinum toxin formation.
- · Specific allergens with processes like breading, battering, marinating with spices - to verify both the allergen cross contamination and change over processes as well as Staphylococcus aureus toxin formation.
- · Processes involving Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Listeria monocytogenes (L. mono)  and  Clostridium  botulinum  (C.  botulinum)  pathogenic  growth  -  e.g.  drying, smoking, LACFs, Acidified Foods.
- · Processes involving Natural Toxins - Molluscan Shellfish, Finfish (primarily reef fish), Dungeness crab or other finfish.
- · Processes involving raw ready to eat products - e.g. Sushi.

Documents,  records,  and  procedures  for  all  species  within  the  scope  of  certification  and  the associated processes and product forms that the facility produces are subject to assessment as part of the traceability and mass balance exercises, whether or not they were produced at the time of the audit.

CBs must understand that though seafood processing plants opting to achieve certification to SPS that produce both farm raised, and wild caught species have an option to choose the scope of certification to be either: i) 'only farm raised', ii) 'only wild caught' or iii) 'both farm raised and wild caught' species categories as stated above. However, within the selected scope of certification and considering exclusions, the CB will conduct an audit to cover all parts of the facility and product forms  that  the  facility  produces.  Within  the  selected  scope  of  certification  and  considering exclusions, Applicants cannot prohibit the CB auditor to particular rooms, process lines, cooked versus raw products and/or species during the assessment.

Example: A seafood processing facility producing both farm raised and wild caught species, and applying  for  SPS  certification,  may  elect  to  certify  only  farm  raised  species  as  their  scope  of certification.    The  scope  of  the  audit  would  therefore  be  limited  to  farm  raised  species  and production  processes  only.  However,  the  auditor  must  be  allowed  access  to  all  rooms  and production lines within the entire facility, including all storage units and production areas, to ensure that the full scope of certification is being met, regardless of facility designations for only farm raised and/or wild caught species production. This is to verify that there is no cross contamination between  farm-raised  and  wild  caught  species  and  their  production  processes,  including  any incidental  or  inadvertent  substitution  where  there  are  similar  species  of  farm-raised  and  wildcaught being processed at the facility.

## D. Farms, Hatcheries and Feed Mills

Applicants must be in operation at the time of the audit. Farms and hatcheries must be stocked and in production. Feed Mills must be producing aquaculture feed (in case they also produce feed for terrestrial animals and/or pet food) per the scope of the certification.

## 4.6 Audit Teams

Audit Team Definition - More than one auditor conducting an audit. One auditor of the audit team is appointed as the audit team leader. NOTE: This section does not apply to Enhanced Social audits.

## 4.6.1 Audit Team Structure

The CB, where there is a necessity for an audit team, must select auditors and allocate them as an audit  team including the appointment of an audit team leader per competence and experience stated under clause 3.12.3 above. The CB must consider the following when assigning an audit to an audit team.

- · Audit duration.
- · The overall competence of the audit team, taking into account audit scope and criteria.
- · Type and complexity of the processes to be audited.
- · The ability of the audit team members to work and interact effectively between themselves and with the audit team leader and with the representatives of the facility and other relevant interested parties.
- · The relevant external/internal issues, such as the language of the audit, and the facility's social and cultural characteristics. These issues may be addressed either by the auditor's own skills or through the need for interpreters.
- · Size and composition of the audit team.

Changes to the composition of the audit team may be necessary during the audit, e.g., if a conflict of interest or competence issue arises. If such a situation arises, the conditions for changes to the audit team must be resolved with the appropriate parties (e.g., audit team leader, the CB, audit client or facility, BAP) before any changes are made.

Shadow and witness audits could be part of the audits involving audit teams per criteria stated in section 3.8.1.

The Audit Team Leader and audit team members must be competent in the scope of the audit and must be approved by BAP for the said category. The assignments of the various audit tasks and/or portions of the standards to be audited is the responsibility of the audit team leader and the audit team members must abide by his/her decision.

Where matters of conflict or other ineffective interaction/communication arise within the audit team  during  the  audit,  the  audit  team  leader  must  resolve  them  so  as  to  not  affect  the  audit process.  The  audit  team  leader's  decision  must  be  respected  by  the  audit  team  and  his/her decision would be final. In case these cannot be resolved the audit team leader must inform the CB who will inform BAP for further resolution of the issues of disagreement.

The audit team leader is the primary contact for the audit and hence must make arrangements for the audit to place in an effective manner to achieve the objectives of the audit including but not limited to the below.

- · confirm communication channels with the facility.
- · confirm the authority to conduct the audit.
- · provide relevant information on the audit objectives, scope, criteria, methods.
- · request access to relevant information for planning purposes including information on the risks and opportunities the organization has identified and how they are addressed.
- · determine applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and other requirements relevant to the activities, processes, products and services of the facility.
- · confirm the agreement with the facility regarding the extent of the disclosure and the treatment of confidential information.
- · make arrangements for the audit including the schedule/plan.
- · determine any location-specific arrangements for access, health and safety, security, confidentiality or other.
- · agree on the attendance of observers and the need for interpreters for the audit team.
- · determine any areas of interest, concern or risks to the facility in relation to the specific audit.
- · resolve issues regarding composition of the audit team with the facility or audit client.

## 4.6.2 Audit Planning

Audit planning must consider the risks of the audit activities on the facility's processes and provide the  basis  for  the  agreement  among  the  audit  client,  audit  team  and  the  facility  regarding  the conduct of the audit. Planning shall facilitate the efficient scheduling and coordination of the audit activities in order to achieve the objectives effectively.

The amount of detail provided in the audit plan must reflect the scope and complexity of the audit. In planning the audit, the audit team leader shall consider the following:

- · The composition of the audit team and its overall competence.
- · The appropriate audit sampling techniques.
- · Opportunities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit activities.
- · The risks of not achieving the audit objectives due to ineffective audit planning.
- · The risks to the facility due to the audit team approach (e.g., presence of the audit team members adversely influencing the facility's arrangements for health and safety, environment and quality, and its products, services, personnel or infrastructure).

Audit planning and preparation must address the need for the audit team to familiarize themselves with facility's facilities and processes. Audit plans must be presented to the facility ideally prior to the audit.

The audit team leader, in  consultation with the audit team, shall assign to each team member responsibility for auditing specific processes, activities, functions or locations and, as appropriate, authority  for  decision-making.  Such  assignments  must  take  into  account  the  impartiality  and objectivity and competence of auditors and the effective use of resources.

## 4.6.3 Audit Process

During the opening meeting, which must be chaired by the audit team leader where he/she must make arrangements to introduce the audit team and their roles. The audit team leader must also confirm the audit plan and other relevant arrangements as below with the facility.

- · The date and time for the closing meeting.
- · Interim meetings between the audit team and the facility's management.
- · Any changes needed to the audit plan.
- · Keeping the facility informed of audit progress during the audit.
- · Availability of resources needed by the audit team.
- · Confidentiality and information security.
- · Access to all areas of the facility.
- · Health and safety, security, emergency, and other arrangements for the audit team.

Audit team meetings must be held, as appropriate, by the audit team leader in order to allocate work assignments and decide possible changes. Changes to the work assignments can be made as the audit progresses in order to ensure the achievement of the audit objectives. The audit team members must collect and review the information relevant to their audit assignments and prepare documented information for the audit, using any appropriate media. The documented information for the audit can include but is not limited to:

- · physical or digital checklists.
- · audit sampling details.
- · audio visual information.

During the audit, it may be necessary to make formal arrangements for communication within the audit  team,  as  well  as  with  the  facility.  The  audit  team  must  confer  periodically  to  exchange information,  assess  audit  progress  and  reassign  work  between  the  audit  team  members,  as needed.  The  audit  team  leader  must  periodically  communicate  the  progress,  any  significant findings and any concerns to the facility, as appropriate.

All audit team members must submit their portion of the audit evidence to the audit team leader for him/her to collate compliance as well as non-compliance issues and prepare the final audit report per clause 4.8. The audit team leader must check with the audit team members from time to time as to the progress of the audit. The closing meeting is always chaired by the audit team leader.

The audit team leader may seek the assistance of the audit team members review of objective evidence obtained to close non-conformities identified, if any and it is obligatory for the audit team members to assist the audit team leader until the certification decision is made by the CB.

The CB must have a process in place to evaluate the outcome of the audits conducted by audit teams. The results of such evaluations must be documented and shared with BAP as and when requested. Also, the results must be used to effect improvements of the audit process.

(Generally,  policy)                                                                                    | Objective evidence verifying the proper  implementation of corrective action and  closing of non-conformities shall be  submitted to the Certification Body in  accordance with BAP certification  management rules.                    | Major             |
| Where absolute compliance with  requirements and/or the intent of any  clause in the Standard has not been  demonstrated. The matter does not rise  to the level of Major or Critical and tends  to be lower risk issues or isolated  instances rather than patterns. Not  indicative of an overall breakdown in  compliance and systems. | Objective evidence verifying the proper  implementation of corrective actions and  closure of non-conformities shall be  submitted to the Certification Body in  accordance with BAP certification  management rules.                   | Minor             |

The  CB  auditor  must  record  this  in  the  audit  report  and  communicate  the  details  to  the  CB. Objective evidence which properly verifies corrective action implemented, including addressing of root cause, shall be submitted to the CB by the facility (all facilities - processing plants, farmsstandalone, groups, clusters, hatcheries, feed mills) within 35 calendar days from the day following the end of the audit.

At the closing meeting, the auditor shall present his/her findings, and discuss all nonconformities that have been identified during the audit but shall not make comment on the likely outcome of the certification status. A written summary of the nonconformities discussed at the closing meeting shall be left with the facility upon completion of the audit.

A written non-conformance summary shall be provided to the CB by the auditor within 48 hours of the  audit  completion.  This  time  frame  may  be  extended  by  1  or  2  days  under  extenuating circumstances.

The CB technical person or committee shall review the non-conformance summary promptly within the allocated timeframes stated under clause 5.2 below.

This  review  shall  ensure  the  non-conformance  statements  are  clear,  the  severity/rating  of nonconformity assigned is appropriate to the non-conformance statement and intent of the clause, and the auditor has not cited multiple non-conformities for the same deviation at multiple clauses.

Once the non-conformance summary has been approved by the CB technical committee, it shall be immediately forwarded to Best Aquaculture Practices along with page 1 of the audit report. BAP shall  receive  this  information  no  more  than  10  calendar  days  from  the  date  the  audit  was completed.

All nonconformities issued during the audits must be closed prior to granting the certification for all  facility  types.  In  circumstances  where  the  corrective  action  involves  structural  changes, engineering modifications, and for seasonal facilities when nonconformities cannot be corrected within a 35-calendar day timeframe due to lead times for structural improvements and equipment installation, any extraordinary circumstances and/or due to seasonal production shutdown prior to the deadline for submitting corrective action evidence, the nonconformities shall be conditionally closed out pursuant to the below conditions:

- · CB must notify the BAP.
- · The nonconformity must be of a Minor rating.
- · The nonconformity must not be for a deviation related to food safety and/or legal issues.
- · Temporary action is taken by the facility to correct the deviation and a detailed plan with a definitive timeframe for closure must be sought by the CB from the facility.
- · CB must approve the temporary corrections, the corrective action plan and timeframe.
- · CB must periodically verify the actions taken by the facility per their CA plan.
- · CB auditor and/or technical committee shall document all details of justification of the conditional closure, how the risk is being controlled, and the agreed completion date.
- · Such nonconformities along with their corrective actions shall be verified during the subsequent recertification audit and for facilities under group scheme these shall be verified during the surveillance audits.
- · Any  nonconformities  that  are  not  closed  out  during  the  subsequent  recertification audit shall be escalated to the next higher NC rating (e.g. a minor NC will be escalated to a Major NC).

Major NCs must be closed out within the timeframe of 42-calendar days and/or prior to the end of the season for seasonal facilities. These cannot be left open to achieve certification.

Repeat nonconformities from the previous audit are to be cited as repeats in the nonconformity summary  report  and  audit  report  of  the  next  audit.  Repeat  nonconformities  where  CA  is  not implemented adequately during the subsequent recertification audit shall be escalated to the next higher NC rating (e.g., a minor NC will be escalated to a Major NC). CBs and their auditors must exercise caution when assessing repeat nonconformities as they must be the exact same deviation to be assigned as repeat NCs. For example, a hose on the floor at room A during the previous audit was issued a minor NC and the auditor again found a hose on the floor during the current audit and was in room B. Hence, this cannot be considered as a repeat as the NC is not exactly the same. If many such similar deviations are noted, then the auditor may assess a nonconformity against the management commitment requirement of the standard. The nonconformity rating must be decided

by  the  auditor  and  CB  depending  on  the  risk  of  such  deviations  to  the  products  and  the  BAP scheme.

## 4.8 Audit Reporting

The  auditor  shall  provide  a  full  report  of  the  audit.  The  auditor  shall  submit  the  report  to  the Technical Manager or committee of the CB.

The report shall follow the format specified by Best Aquaculture Practices and shall provide full details  of  the  audit.  The  report  shall  be  issued  whether  certification  is  granted  or  not,  and  in accordance  with  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  guidelines.  The  applicant  who  commissioned  the audit owns the Audit Report, however, an agreement shall be in place between the applicant and the CB for the authorization of the provision of a report to Best Aquaculture Practices.

The details/comments section of the Audit Report shall be in open text format and in English. Reports shall also include comments both where criteria have been met, and not met. Objective evidence to support both conformance and any non-conformances that have been identified shall be referenced within the report. Within the Audit Report there shall be a record of the duration of the audit and any reason for the lengthening or shortening of the duration from that of typical or expected audit duration.

Audit reports must clearly identify whether certification audits are unannounced.

The Audit Report must accurately reflect the findings of the auditor during the audit.

## 4.9 Corrective Action of Non-Conformities

All  non-conformities  for  all  facilities,  standards  and  audit  formats  shall  have  facility  corrective action responses and objective evidence submitted of effective correction and implementation. Such evidence is essential for  the  audit  and  Certification  Body  to  verify  that  the  applicant  has properly closed out the non-conformance and that the Applicant meets the requirements of the Standard.

Verification  may  take  the  form  of  further  on-site  assessment  or  of  objective  evidence  such  as submitted paperwork including updated procedures, records, and photographs etc. The evidence must be assessed by a technically competent member or group within the Certification Body. Note, that  statements  of  intent  alone  by  the  facility  to  correct  a  non-conformance  do  not  qualify  as objective  evidence.  For  evidence  to  be  acceptable,  it  must  address  the  root  cause  of  the  nonconformity.

All evidence of corrective action must be returned, completed, and verified by the Certification Body within a timescale defined by BAP before certification can be awarded.

## 4.10 Technical Review of the Audit Results, and the Certification Decision Making Entity

The audit report, test result and corrective action evidence must be considered by a Certification Manager or Committee of the CB. Audit results must undergo a technical review prior to granting, suspending, withdrawing or renewing certification.

Certification decisions shall be made by a person, persons or committee that were not involved in the facility audit. The Certification Body and the decision-making process shall be impartial and free from any conflict of interest to include any commercial or financial pressures or gains.

The certification review/decision making group/team/committee shall be adequately staffed to ensure timely reviews and decision making. The committee make up shall be:

- · Minimum 2 persons;
- · At least 1 at all times having experience and competence in the BAP scheme.

## The review shall ensure:

- · That reviewers are impartial and technically competent to understand the content of reports, corrective action evidence and test result. And that these data are accurately assessed to demonstrate satisfactory evidence of compliance with the scheme
- · That all requirements of the standard have been fully covered, using any supporting notes made during the assessment by a suitably qualified auditor
- · That the scope of the report covers the scope applied for by the client and that the report  provides  satisfactory  evidence  that  all  areas  of  the  scope  have  been  fully investigated
- · That all areas of non-conformity have been identified, and effective corrective action has been taken to resolve these non-conformities including the addressing of  root cause

The result of the certification decision will be either:

- · Applicant meets the Standards
- · Applicant fails to meet the Standards

## 4.11 Complaints, Appeals and Disputes

Complaints,  appeals,  and  disputes  brought  before  the  Certification  Body  by  facilities,  Best Aquaculture Practices or other parties shall be addressed in accordance with the Certification Body procedure  and  in  compliance  with  this  section.  The  applicant  has  the  right  to  appeal  the certification decision of the Certification Body. The Certification Body shall have a documented appeals process in place that is publicly available, and ensure the facility has a copy of that policy upon request and/or in the event of a complaint. Appeals shall be made in writing within the time frame set by the CB. Actions taken and their effectiveness must be documented.

A  full  investigation  shall  be  conducted,  and  a  written  response  provided  by  Certification  Body personnel and that are independent of the auditor and Certification decision maker(s). Appeals and complaints  must  be  resolved  within  the  time  frame  set  by  the  CB.  Actions  taken  and  their effectiveness must be documented.

## 4.12 Certificate Content

The CB will issue certificates that shall conform to the following content requirements:

- · Name and address of the facility
- · Standard and version number to which the certificate applies
- · Scope of certification, species and category (e.g., farm raised, wild caught or both for SPS)

The  Certificate  is  the  property  of  the  CB  and  the  control  and  management  of  the  status  of  a certificate shall be in place. Copies of certificates shall be provided to Best Aquaculture Practices for verification and consistency of content.

Certification shall not be awarded where any non-conformances requiring corrective action, remain outstanding.

Ongoing certification is maintained where there is substantive and demonstrable evidence that the Applicant remains in compliance with the criteria of the Standard in question.

When timescales, verification and/or corrective actions are not completed as required, suspension and/or withdrawal of facility certification may be implemented.

## 4.13 Certification Validity

For new facilities the certificate validity or expiration date shall be 12 consecutive calendar months from the date of the issue of certificate.

The recertification certificate validity or expiration date shall be 12 consecutive calendar months from the previous certificate validity or expiration date.

The CB acknowledges that the certification of a facility continues after a certificate is issued and during the period of time for which such certificate is in effect. Therefore, the CB is responsible for, including responding to, acting on or rectifying, any instances of non-conformity or non-compliance that may arise during such period of time.

## 4.14 Document Control and Document Registry

All records and documentation related to GSA Standard's audits shall be retained by the CB for a minimum of five years. Internal documentation will also be included such as personnel and training records.

CBs shall ensure that their agreements with Applicants dictate that all documents in relation to the audit shall be made available to Best Aquaculture Practices upon request. The Certification Body shall have in place a document control procedure that ensure all documents and records related to the CBs BAP certification process and to the GSA Standards and procedures are up to date and

## 4.15 Changes in Certification Requirements

The CB shall give due notice of any changes it intends to make in its requirements for certification and that  any  time  frames,  where  applicable,  for  adjustments  to  such  changes  are  defined  and reasonable.

## 5.0 Certification Body (CB) Performance Monitoring

## 5.1 CB Internal Monitoring

Certification  Bodies  shall  have  an  internal  audit  program  which  includes  internal  audits  of  its Quality  Management  System  (see  3.1.2)  as  well  other  systems,  records,  processes,  staff  and auditor  competency  programs,  and  all  other  aspects  of  the  certification  system  to  ensure compliance and consistency in the application of the GSA Standard(s). This internal monitoring program shall also include on site assessments, shadow and/or witness assessments of auditors in  accordance  with  the  scope  of  every  type  or  category  of  assessment  for  which  the  CB  is approved/accredited under the GSA Standard(s).

The internal audit frequency of the CB's systems shall be defined and shall occur, at minimum, annually. The CB shall also conduct internal monitoring of the effectiveness of auditor training and competency requirements and assessments as described under 'auditor competency' and other parts of this document. Auditor assessments shall be conducted on an ongoing basis to include monitoring  of  the  type  and  number  of  nonconformities,  competence  in  evaluating  objective evidence,  the  audit  process,  the  proper  application  of  the  GSA  Standard(s),  auditor  calibration, training, and knowledge, and so on. These reviews shall include review of documents, interviews, meetings, etc.

## 5.2 Best Aquaculture Practices Performance Monitoring

The  credibility  of  the  GSA  Standard(s)  is  directly  related  to  the  competence,  integrity  and performance of the approved Certification Bodies and their auditors.

Therefore, Best Aquaculture Practices will monitor the performance of Certification Bodies (as per the  CB  Review  Procedure)  and  their  auditors  to  ensure  that  the  Standards  are  being  applied consistently, auditor and CB personnel competence are properly ensured, and that reports, and certification decisions are completed accurately and timely.

## 5.2.1 Complaints Investigation

In the event that Best Aquaculture Practices is made aware of any failure or potential failure by the CB to apply the principles and criteria of any of the GSA Standards during the conduct of an audit or otherwise, Best Aquaculture Practices will request a documented report of the reasons for the complaint. This report will be referred to the CB conducting the Certification.

Best  Aquaculture  Practices  will  require  a  full  investigation  of  the  report  by  the  CB  and,  where applicable, the certified site and a response shall be submitted to Best Aquaculture Practices for consideration  within  28  days.  If  the  issues  raised  in  the  complaints  are  not  addressed  to  the satisfaction of Best Aquaculture Practices, the CB will be sanctioned.

Best  Aquaculture  Practices  may,  at  their  discretion,  suspend  or  revoke  CB  approval  if  in  Best Aquaculture Practices' opinion, the CB fails to properly address matters raised or if the CB's actions may bring the Certification Scheme into disrepute.

For the avoidance of doubt the CB may not undertake any audits while the contract is suspended or following any termination.

Where a complaint is considered, at the discretion of Best Aquaculture Practices, to have been justified,  the  information  relating  to  the  complaint  may  be  made  available  to  the  Certification Bodies Accreditation Body.

Best  Aquaculture  Practices  will  notify  the  person  referring  the  issue  of  the  outcome  of  the investigation.

## 5.2.2 Review of Audit Reports

Audit report formats are determined by Best Aquaculture Practices and only authorized versions are  to  be  used.  A  sampling  of  reports  will  be  monitored  by  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  for completeness as part of the Best Aquaculture Practices' performance monitoring procedures. Best Aquaculture Practices takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the content and information, or omissions contained in each audit report, which are the responsibility of the Certification Body.

Where  audit  reports  do  not  conform  to  the  agreed  standard,  this  will  be  discussed  with  the Certification Body responsible. Where BAP requests further information related to the content of a report, such as notes, records or evidence observed, this information shall be provided within 15 working days. If extra time is needed the CB is to notify Best Aquaculture Practices immediately as to the reason and time frame for completion. Approval of delay is at Best Aquaculture Practices discretion.

The CB shall at a minimum provide the below to BAP Office after Certification Decision as part of the audit pack as applicable to facility types

- · NC Summary Report
- · Final Audit Report
- · Product Test Reports
- · Effluent Test Reports
- · Corrective Action Evidence and NC Closure Reports
- · Certificate

## 5.2.3 Sanctioning, Suspension, and Withdrawal

Certification  Body  performance  monitoring  by  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  is  intended  to  help Certification Bodies ensure compliance with the requirements of the Standard(s) in order to protect the integrity of the scheme.

Wherever a Certification Body's performance at the discretion of Best Aquaculture Practices, falls short of a requirement this will be brought to their attention and may lead to suspension. Monitoring of CBs for compliance may result in shortfalls in, for example, areas such as adherence to time frames, auditor competency, confidentiality, or code of ethics breaches, CB personnel competency, improperly closed nonconformities, improperly trained auditors, and so forth.

The Certification Body shall submit a response to the deficiencies along with a corrective action plan to Best Aquaculture Practices describing steps taken or to be taken, and the time frames. The response  and  plan  shall  be  provided  within  15  working  days  of  receipt  of  notification  of  Best Aquaculture Practices of the deficiency. Objective evidence of proper correction may be requested by Best Aquaculture Practices and must be provided promptly.

Repeated failures, a failure to co-operate in the investigation of an issue, failure to address an issue satisfactorily, potential breaches of ethics, confidentiality, or the terms of agreement between Best Aquaculture Practice sand the CB, or the occurrence of a significant failure which could bring the scheme into disrepute or other serious incidences as determined by Best Aquaculture Practices will result in the sanction, suspension, or withdrawal of a Certification Body.

For the avoidance of doubt the CB may not undertake any audits while the contract is suspended. The Certification Body's Accreditation Body will be notified of the suspension or withdrawal and the reasons.

## 6.0 Information Management and Security

## 6.2 Confidentiality of Information

During the period of CB approval and for a period of 3 years after termination of approval for any reason, each party shall:

- · Keep all confidential information confidential;
- · Not disclose the confidential information to any other person without the prior written consent of the other; and
- · Not use the confidential information for any purpose except the performance of their obligations under the contract

## 7.0 Legal and Liability Management

## 7.1 Legal Challenge

In the event that the applicant becomes aware of the notification of an impending prosecution with respect to product safety or legality, they shall immediately make the CB aware of the situation.

The CB in turn shall take steps to assess the implications of the situation and take appropriate actions. If there is likelihood that the legal proceedings will lead to adverse publicity or government intervention, the CB will immediately inform Best Aquaculture Practices of the incident.

## 7.2 Liability Insurance

The CB shall ensure that appropriate liability insurance is in place. This insurance shall incorporate employer's liability, public and product liability and professional indemnity, errors and omissions. A copy of the relevant insurance certification must be submitted to Best Aquaculture Practices upon request.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  approved  CB  to  ensure  that  the  referenced  insurance  covers  all activities, regardless of where performed, or whether carried out directly or subcontracted. Where CB's require subcontract auditors to carry their own insurance, it is the responsibility of the CB to inform them.

The CB must agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the GSA and Best Aquaculture Practices from and against any costs, claims, demands, liabilities, expenses, damages, or losses (including without limitation consequential losses and loss of profit, and all interest, penalties and reasonable legal  and  other  professional  costs  and  expenses)  arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  BAP certification activities, including CB and/or auditor negligence, default or breach of the contract.

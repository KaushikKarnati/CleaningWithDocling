## We need your feedback!

## Help us finalise the new ASC Farm Standard

This year we are finalising the new ASC Farm Standard.

The Standard brings together a wealth of expertise and insight from previous rounds of stakeholder consultation and other inputs.

Please complete our survey to have your say on the Standard's final content.

These slides summarise the ASC Farm Standard's key requirements, tools and benefits. You will find information about each of the four principles that underpin the Standard and their key criteria. Please use the following symbols as a guide:

## Farm Standard Interpretation Manual

## Guidance to support implementation

## The Interpretation Manual is an informative guide containing four main sections:

- 1. Intent : Indicates the aim and intention behind  the indicator. This helps to deliver clarity about the reason why a certain requirement is in place.
- 2. Interpretation of requirement: Provides information about the context and rationale of the topic addressed by the indicator and guidance to assist farmers with the interpretation and implementation of the requirements. The guidance includes best practices and, when possible, examples.
- 3. Auditor considerations :  Contains guidance and suggestions for CAB's auditors on the evidence for the verification of compliance with the requirements of the standard.
- 4. Useful resources: Provides information or references to further assist in the implementation of a particular requirement.

The  IM  will  be updated  annually to  include learnings  from  the  implementation  of  the  FS. It  is currently  in development and the structure may be subject to change once all consultation feedback has been considered.

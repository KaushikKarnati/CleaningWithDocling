## PREFACE

From ancient  times,  fishing  has  been  a  major  source  of  food  for  humanity  and  a provider of employment and economic benefits to those engaged in this activity. The wealth of aquatic resources was assumed to be an unlimited gift of nature. However, with  increased  knowledge  and  the  dynamic  development  of  fisheries  after  the second  world  war,  this  myth  has  faded  in  face  of  the  realization  that  aquatic resources, although renewable, are not infinite and need to be  properly managed, if their contribution to the nutritional, economic and social well-being of the growing world's population is to be sustained.

The  widespread  introduction  in  the  mid-seventies  of  exclusive  economic  zones (EEZs)  and  the  adoption  in  1982,  after  long  deliberations,  of  the  United  Nations Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  provided  a  new  framework  for  the  better management of marine resources. The new legal regime of the ocean gave coastal States  rights  and  responsibilities  for  the  management  and use  of  fishery  resources within their EEZs which embrace some 90 percent of the world's  marine fisheries. Such extended national jurisdiction was a necessary but insufficient step toward the efficient  management  and  sustainable  development      of  fisheries.  Many  coastal States continued to face serious challenges as, lacking, experience and financial and physical resources, they sought to extract greater benefits from the fisheries within their EEZs.

In recent years, world fisheries have become  a market-driven, dynamically developing  sector  of  the  food  industry  and  coastal  States  have  striven  to  take advantage  of  their  new  opportunities  by  investing  in  modern  fishing  fleets  and processing factories in response to growing international demand for fish and fishery products. By the late 1980s it became clear, however, that fisheries resources could no longer sustain such rapid and often uncontrolled exploitation and development, and  that  new  approaches  to  fisheries  management  embracing  conservation  and environmental  considerations  were  urgently  needed.  The  situation  was  aggravated by  the  realization  that  unregulated  fisheries  on  the  high  seas,  in  some  cases involving  straddling  and  highly  migratory  fish  species,  which  occur  within  and outside EEZs, were becoming a matter of increasing concern.

The Committee on Fisheries (COFI) at its Nineteenth Session in March 1991 called for  the  development  of  new  concepts  which  would  lead  to  responsible,  sustained fisheries. Subsequently, the International Conference on Responsible Fishing, held in  1992  in  Cancún  (Mexico)  further  requested.  FAO  to  prepare  an  international Code  of  Conduct  to  address  these  concerns.  The  outcome  of  this  Conference, particularly the Declaration of Cancún, was an important contribution to the 1992 United  Nations  Conference  on  Environment  and  Development  (UNCED),    in particular  its  Agenda  21. Subsequently,  the United

Nations  Conference  on  Straddling  Fish  Stocks  and  Highly  Migratory  Fish  Stocks was convened, to which FAO provided important technical back-up. In   November 1993, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High  Seas  was  adopted  at  the Twenty-seventh Session of the FAO Conference.

Noting  these  and  other    important  developments  in    world    fisheries,  the    FAO Governing Bodies recommended the formulation of a global Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries which would be consistent with these instruments and, in a non-mandatory manner, establish principles and standards applicable to tile conservation, management and development of all fisheries.   The Code, which was unanimously  adopted  on  31  October  1995  by  the  FAO  Conference,  provides  a necessary  framework  for  national  and  international  efforts  to  ensure  sustainable exploitation of aquatic living resources in harmony with the environment.

FAO, in accordance with its mandate, is fully committed to assisting Member States, particularly  developing  countries,  in  the  efficient  implementation  of  the  Code  of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and will report to the United Nations community on the progress achieved and further action required.

## INTRODUCTION

Fisheries,  including  aquaculture,  provide  a  vital  source  of  food,  employment, recreation, trade and economic well-being for people throughout the world, both for present and future generations and should therefore be conducted in a responsible manner. This Code sets out principles and international standards of behaviour for responsible practices with a view to ensuring the effective conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources, with due respect for the ecosystem and biodiversity. The Code recognizes the nutritional, economic, social, environmental  and  cultural  importance  of  fisheries  and  the  interests  of  all  those concerned  with  the  fishery  sector.  The  Code  takes  into  account  the  biological characteristics of the resources and their environment and the interests of consumers and other users.  States and all those involved in fisheries are encouraged to apply the Code and give effect to it.

## ARTICLE 1 - NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE CODE

- 1.1 This Code is voluntary. However, certain parts of it are based on relevant rules  of  international    law,  including    those  reflected  in  the  United  Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 . The Code also contains 1 provisions that may be or have already been given binding effect by means of other obligatory legal instruments amongst the Parties, such as the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels  on  the  High  Seas,  1993,  which,  according  to  FAO  Conference  resolution 15/93, paragraph 3, forms an integral part of the Code.
- 1.2 The  Code  is  global  in  scope,  and  is  directed  toward  members  and  nonmembers of FAO, fishing entities, sub regional, regional and global organizations, whether  governmental  or  non-governmental,  and  all  persons  concerned  with  the conservation  of  fishery  resources  and  management  and  development  of  fisheries, such  as  fishers,  those  engaged  in  processing  and  marketing  of  fish  and  fishery products and other users of the aquatic environment in relation to fisheries.
- 1.3 The Code provides principles and standards applicable to the conservation, management and development of all fisheries. It also covers the capture, processing and  trade  of  fish  and  fishery  products,  fishing  operations,  aquaculture,  fisheries research and the integration of fisheries into coastal area management.

- 1.4 In this Code, the reference to States includes the European Community in matters  within  its  competence,  and  the  term  fisheries  applies  equally  to  capture fisheries and aquaculture.

## ARTICLE 2 - OBJECTIVES OF THE CODE

The objectives of the Code are to:

- a) establish principles,  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  rules  of  international law, for responsible fishing and fisheries activities, taking into account all their  relevant  biological,  technological,  economic,  social,  environmental and commercial aspects;
- b) establish principles and criteria for the elaboration and implementation of national  policies  for  responsible  conservation  of  fisheries  resources  and fisheries management and development;
- c) serve as an instrument of reference to help States to establish or to improve the legal and institutional framework required for the exercise of responsible fisheries and in the formulation and implementation of appropriate measures;
- d) provide guidance which may be used where appropriate in the formulation and implementation of international agreements and other legal instruments, both binding and voluntary;
- e) facilitate and promote technical, financial and other cooperation in conservation of fisheries resources and fisheries management and development;
- f) promote  the  contribution  of  fisheries  to  food  security  and  food  quality, giving priority to the nutritional needs of local communities;
- g) promote protection of living aquatic resources and their environments and coastal areas;
- h) promote the trade of fish and fishery products in conformity with relevant international  rules  and  avoid  the  use  of  measures  that  constitute  hidden barriers to such trade;

- i) promote  research  on  fisheries  as  well  as  on  associated  ecosystems  and relevant environmental factors; and
- j) provide standards of conduct for all persons involved in the fisheries sector.

## ARTICLE 3 - RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS

- 3.1 The Code is to be interpreted and applied in conformity with the relevant rules of international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982. Nothing in this Code prejudices the rights, jurisdiction and duties of States under international law as reflected in the Convention.
- 3.2 The Code is also to be interpreted and applied:
- a) in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Agreement  for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks;
- b) in accordance with other applicable rules of international law, including the respective obligations of States pursuant to international agreements to which they are party; and
- c) in the light of the 1992 Declaration of Cancún, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment  and  Development,  and  Agenda  21  adopted  by  the  United  Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), in particular Chapter 17 of Agenda 21, and other relevant declarations and international instruments.

## ARTICLE 4 - IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND UPDATING

- 4.1 All members and non-members of FAO, fishing entities and relevant subregional, regional and global organizations, whether governmental or nongovernmental,  and  all  persons  concerned  with  the  conservation,  management  and utilization  of  fisheries  resources  and  trade  in  fish  and  fishery  products  should collaborate  in  the  fulfillment  and  implementation  of  the  objectives  and  principles contained in this Code.
- 4.2 FAO, in accordance with  its  role  within  the  United  Nations  system,  will monitor the application and implementation of the Code and its effects on fisheries and the Secretariat will report accordingly to the Committee on Fisheries (COFI).

- All  States,  whether  members  or  non-members  of  FAO,  as  well  as  relevant  international organizations, whether governmental or non-governmental should actively cooperate with FAO in this work.
- 4.3 FAO,  through  its  competent  bodies,  may  revise  the  Code,  taking  into account developments in fisheries as well as reports to COFI on the implementation of the Code.
- 4.4 States and  international organizations,  whether  governmental  or  nongovernmental, should promote the understanding of the Code among those involved in  fisheries,  including,  where  practicable,  by  the  introduction  of  schemes  which would promote voluntary acceptance of the Code and its effective application.

## ARTICLE 5 - SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

- 5.1 The capacity of developing countries to implement the recommendations of this Code should be duly taken into account.
- 5.2 In order to achieve the objectives of this Code and to support its effective implementation,  countries,  relevant  international'  organizations,  whether  governmental or non-governmental, and financial institutions should give full recognition to the special circumstances and requirements of developing countries, including in particular the least-developed among them, and small island developing countries. States, relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and financial institutions should work for the adoption of measures to address the needs of developing countries, especially in the areas of financial and technical assistance, technology transfer, training and scientific cooperation and in enhancing their ability to  develop  their  own  fisheries  as  well  as  to  participate  in  high  seas  fisheries, including access to such fisheries.

## ARTICLE 6 - GENERAL PRINCIPLES

- 6.1 States  and  users  of  living  aquatic  resources  should  conserve  aquatic  ecosystems.  The  right  to  fish  carries  with  it  the  obligation  to  do  so  in  a  responsible manner so as to ensure effective conservation and management of the living aquatic resources.
- 6.2 Fisheries  management  should  promote  the  maintenance  of  the  quality, diversity and availability of fishery resources in sufficient quantities for present and future generations in the context of food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development.  Management  measures should  not only  ensure  the conservation  of

target species but also of species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target species.

- 6.3 States should prevent over fishing and excess fishing capacity and should implement management measures to ensure that fishing effort is commensurate with the  productive  capacity  of  the  fishery  resources  and  their  sustainable  utilization. States should take measures to rehabilitate populations as far as possible and when appropriate.
- 6.4 Conservation and management decisions for fisheries should be based on the best scientific evidence available, also taking into account traditional knowledge of the resources and their habitat, as well as relevant environmental, economic and social factors. States should assign priority to undertake research and data collection in  order  to  improve  scientific  and  technical  knowledge of fisheries including their interaction  with  the  ecosystem.  In  recognizing  the  transboundary  nature  of  many aquatic ecosystems, States should encourage bilateral and multilateral cooperation in research, as appropriate.
- 6.5 States  and  subregional  and  regional  fisheries  management  organizations should  apply  a  precautionary  approach  widely  to  conservation,  management  and exploitation  of  living  aquatic  resources  in  order  to  protect  them  and  preserve  the aquatic  environment,  taking  account  of  the  best  scientific  evidence  available.  The absence  of  adequate  scientific  information  should  not  be  used  as  a  reason  for postponing  or  failing  to  take  measures  to  conserve  target  species,  associated  or dependent species and non-target species and their environment.
- 6.6 Selective  and  environmentally  safe  fishing  gear  and  practices  should  be further  developed  and  applied,  to  the  extent  practicable,  in  order  to  maintain biodiversity  and  to  conserve  the  population  structure  and  aquatic  ecosystems  and protect  fish  quality.  Where  proper  selective  and  environmentally  safe  fishing  gear and practices exist, they should be recognized and accorded a priority in establishing conservation  arid  management  measures  for  fisheries.  States  and  users  of  aquatic ecosystems should minimize waste, catch of non-target species, both fish and nonfish species, and impacts on associated or dependent species.
- 6.7 The  harvesting,  handling,  processing  and  distribution  of  fish  and  fishery products should be carried out in a manner which will maintain the nutritional value, quality and safety of the products, reduce waste and minimize negative impacts on the environment.

- 6.8 All critical fisheries habitats in marine and fresh water ecosystems, such as wetlands,  mangroves,  reefs,  lagoons,  nursery  and  spawning  areas,  should  be protected and rehabilitated as far as possible and where necessary. Particular effort should be made to protect such habitats from destruction, degradation, pollution and other significant impacts resulting from human activities that threaten the health and viability of the fishery resources.
- 6.9 States  should  ensure  that  their  fisheries  interests,  including  the  need  for conservation  of  the  resources,  are  taken  into  account  in  the  multiple  uses  of  the coastal zone  and  are  integrated  into  coastal  area management,  planning  and development.
- 6.10 Within their respective competences and in accordance with international law, including within the framework of subregional or regional fisheries conservation and management organizations or arrangements, States should ensure compliance with and enforcement of conservation and management measures and establish effective mechanisms, as appropriate, to monitor and control the activities of fishing vessels and fishing support vessels.
- 6.11 States  authorizing  fishing  and  fishing  support  vessels  to  fly  their  flags should  exercise  effective  control  over  those  vessels  so  as  to  ensure  the  proper application of this Code. They should ensure that the activities of such vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels. States should also ensure that vessels flying their flags fulfill their obligations concerning the collection and provision of data relating to their fishing activities.
- 6.12 States should, within their respective competences and in accordance with international  law,  cooperate  at  subregional,  regional  and  global  levels  through fisheries management organizations, other international agreements or other arrangements to promote conservation and management, ensure responsible fishing and  ensure effective conservation and  protection of living aquatic resources throughout their range of distribution, taking into account the need for compatible measures in areas within and beyond national jurisdiction.
- 6.13 States  should,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  national  laws  and  regulations, ensure that decision making processes are transparent and achieve timely solutions to urgent matters. States, in accordance  with  appropriate  procedures,  should facilitate consultation  and  the  effective  participation  of industry, fishworkers, environmental and other interested organizations in decision-making with respect to the

development of laws and policies related to fisheries management, development, international lending and aid.

- 6.14 International  trade  in  fish  and  fishery  products  should  be  conducted  in accordance with the principles, rights and obligations established in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement and other relevant international agreements. States should ensure that their policies, programmes and practices related to trade in fish and  fishery products  do  not  result in obstacles to this trade, environmental degradation or negative social, including nutritional, impacts.
- 6.15 States should cooperate in order to prevent disputes. All disputes relating to fishing  activities and  practices  should  be  resolved  in  a  timely,  peaceful  and cooperative  manner,  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  agreements  or  as may otherwise be agreed between the parties. Pending settlement of a dispute, the States concerned should make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a  practical  nature  which  should  be  without  prejudice  to  the  final  outcome  of  any dispute settlement procedure.
- 6.16 States, recognising the paramount importance to fishers and fishfarmers of understanding the conservation and management of the fishery resources on which they depend, should promote awareness of responsible fisheries through education and  training.  They  should  ensure  that  fishers  and  fishfarmers  are  involved  in  the policy formulation and implementation process, also with a view to facilitating the implementation of the Code.
- 6.17 States  should  ensure  that  fishing  facilities  and  equipment  as  well  as  all fisheries activities allow for safe, healthy and fair working and living conditions and meet internationally agreed standards adopted by relevant international organizations.
- 6.18 Recognizing  the important contributions of artisanal and small-scale fisheries  to  employment,  income  and  food  security,  States  should  appropriately protect the rights of fishers and fishworkers, particularly those engaged in subsistence,  small-scale  and  artisanal  fisheries,  to  a  secure  and  just  livelihood,  as well  as  preferential  access,  where  appropriate,  to  traditional  fishing  grounds  and resources in the waters under their national jurisdiction.
- 6.19 States should consider aquaculture, including culture-based fisheries, as a means  to  promote  diversification  of  income  and  diet.  In  so  doing,  States  should ensure that resources are used responsibly and adverse impacts on the environment and on local communities are minimized.

## ARTICLE 7 - FISHERIES MANAGEMENT

## 7.1 General

- 7.1.1 States  and  all  those  engaged  in  fisheries  management  should,  through  an appropriate  policy,  legal  and  institutional  framework,  adopt  measures  for  the longterm conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources. Conservation and management  measures,  whether  at  local,  national,  subregional  or  regional  levels, should be based on the best scientific evidence available and be designed to ensure the  long-term  sustainability  of  fishery  resources  at  levels  which  promote  the objective of their optimum utilization and maintain their availability for present and future generations; short-term considerations should not compromise these objectives.
- 7.1.2 Within  areas  under  national  jurisdiction,  States  should  seek  to  identify relevant domestic parties having a legitimate interest in the use and management of fisheries  resources  and  establish  arrangements  for  consulting  them  to  gain  their collaboration in achieving responsible fisheries.
- 7.1.3 For transboundary fish stocks, straddling fish stocks, highly migratory fish stocks and high seas fish stocks, where these are exploited by two or more States, the States concerned, including the relevant coastal States in the case of straddling and highly migratory stocks, should cooperate to ensure effective conservation and management of the resources. This should be achieved, where appropriate, through the  establishment  of  a  bilateral,  subregional  or  regional  fisheries  organization  or arrangement.
- 7.1.4 A subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement  should  include  representatives  of  States  in  whose  jurisdictions  the resources occur,  as well as representatives from States which have a real interest in the fisheries or  the resources outside national jurisdictions. Where a subregional or regional  fisheries  management  organization  or  arrangement  exists  and  has  the competence  to  establish  conservation  and  management  measures,  those  States should  cooperate  by  becoming  a  member  of  such  organization  or  a  participant  in such arrangement, and actively participate in its work.
- 7.1.5 A  State  which  is  not  a  member  of  a  subregional  or  regional  fisheries management organization or is not a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management  arrangement should nevertheless cooperate, in accordance with relevant  international  agreements  and  international  law,  in  the  conservation  and management of the relevant fisheries resources by giving effect to any conservation and management measures adopted by such organization or arrangement.

- 7.1.6 Representatives  from  relevant  organizations,  both  governmental  and  nongovernmental, concerned with fisheries should be afforded the opportunity to take part in meetings of subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements  as  observers  or  otherwise,  as  appropriate,  in  accordance  with  the procedures  of  the  organization  or  arrangement  concerned.  Such    representative should be given timely access to the records and reports of such meetings, subject to the procedural rules on access to them.
- 7.1.7 States should establish, within their respective competences and capacities. effective mechanisms for fisheries monitoring, surveillance, control and enforcement to ensure compliance with their conservation and management measures,  as  well  as  those  adopted  by  subregional  or  regional  organizations  or arrangements.
- 7.1.8 States should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources as a means of ensuring the effectiveness of conservation and management measures.
- 7.1.9 States and subregional or regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements should ensure transparency in the mechanisms for fisheries management and in the related decision-making process.
- 7.1.10 States and subregional or regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements should give due publicity to conservation and management measures and ensure that laws, regulations and other legal rules governing their implementation  are  effectively  disseminated.  The  bases  and  purposes  of  such measures  should  be  explained  to  users  of  the  resource  in  order  to  facilitate  their application and thus gain increased support in the implementation of such measures.

## 7.2 Management objectives

- 7.2.1 Recognizing  that  long-term  sustainable  use  of  fisheries  resources  is  the overriding  objective  of  conservation  and  management,  States  and  subregional  or regional  fisheries  management  organizations  and  arrangements  should, inter  alia, adopt appropriate measures, based on the best scientific evidence available, which are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable  yield,  as  qualified  by  relevant  environmental  and  economic  factors, including the special requirements of developing countries.

- 7.2.2 Such measures should provide inter alia that:
- a) excess  fishing  capacity  is  avoided  and  exploitation  of  the  stocks  remains economically viable;
- b) the  economic  conditions  under  which  fishing  industries  operate  promote responsible fisheries;
- c) the interests of fishers, including those engaged in subsistence, small-scale and artisanal fisheries, are taken into account;
- d) biodiversity of aquatic habitats and ecosystems is conserved and endangered species are protected;
- e) depleted stocks are allowed to recover or, where appropriate, are actively restored;
- f) adverse environmental impacts on the resources from human activities are assessed and, where appropriate, corrected; and
- g) pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of nontarget  species,  both    fish    and  non-fish  species,  and    impacts  on    associated  or dependent  species  are minimized,  through  measures  including,  to the extent practicable, the development and  use of selective, environmentally safe and  costeffective fishing gear and techniques.
- 7.2.3 States should assess the impacts of environmental factors on target stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent upon the target stocks, and  assess the relationship among  the  populations  in  the ecosystem.

## 7.3 Management framework and procedures

- 7.3.1 To be effective, fisheries management should be concerned with the whole stock unit over its entire area of distribution and take into account previously agreed management measures established and applied in the same region, all removals and the biological unity and other biological characteristics of the stock. The best  scientific  evidence  available  should  be  used  to  determine, inter  alia ,  the  area  of  distribution of the resource and the area through which it migrates during its life cycle.
- 7.3.2 In order to conserve and manage transboundary fish stocks, straddling fish stocks, highly migratory fish stocks and high seas fish stocks throughout their range,

conservation and management measures established for such stocks in accordance with  the  respective  competences  of  relevant  States  or,  where  appropriate,  through subregional  and  regional  fisheries  management  organizations  and  arrangements, should be compatible. Compatibility should be achieved in a manner consistent with the rights, competences and interests of the States concerned.

- 7.3.3 Long-term  management  objectives  should  be  translated  into  management actions, formulated as a fishery management plan or other management framework.
- 7.3.4 States and, where appropriate, subregional or regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements should foster and promote international cooperation  and  coordination  in  all matters related to fisheries, including information gathering and exchange, fisheries research, management and development.
- 7.3.5 States seeking to take any action through a non-fishery organization which may  affect  the  conservation  and  management  measures  taken  by  a  competent subregional  or  regional  fisheries  management  organization  or  arrangement  should consult with the latter, in advance to the extent practicable, and take its views into account.

## 7.4 Data gathering and management advice

- 7.4.1 When considering the adoption of conservation and management measures, the  best  scientific  evidence  available  should  be  taken  into  account  in  order  to evaluate  the  current  state  of  the  fishery  resources  and  the  possible  impact  of  the proposed measures on the resources.
- 7.4.2 Research  in  support  of  fishery  conservation  and  management  should  be promoted,  including  research  on  the  resources  and  on  the  effects  of  climatic, environmental and socio-economic factors. The results of such research should be disseminated to interested parties.
- 7.4.3 Studies should be promoted which provide an understanding of the costs, benefits  and  effects  of  alternative  management  options  designed  to  rationalize fishing, in particular, options relating to excess fishing capacity and excessive levels of fishing effort.
- 7.4.4 States  should ensure that timely, complete and reliable statistics on catch and fishing effort are collected and maintained in accordance with applicable international  standards  and  practices  and  in  sufficient  detail  to  allow  sound  statistical analysis. Such data should be updated regularly and verified through an appropriate

system. States should compile and disseminate such data in a manner consistent with any applicable confidentiality requirements.

- 7.4.5 In order to ensure sustainable management of fisheries and to enable social and economic objectives to be achieved, sufficient knowledge of social, economic and institutional  factors  should  be  developed  through  data  gathering,  analysis  and research.
- 7.4.6 States  should  compile  fishery-related  and  other  supporting  scientific  data relating  to  fish  stocks  covered  by  subregional  or  regional  fisheries  management organizations or arrangements in an internationally agreed format and provide them in  a  timely  manner  to  the  organization  or  arrangement.  In  cases  of  stocks  which occur  in  the  jurisdiction  of  more  than  one  State  and  for  which  there  is  no  such organization or arrangement, the States concerned should agree on a mechanism for cooperation to compile and exchange such data.
- 7.4.7 Subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements should compile data and make them available, in a manner consistent with  any  applicable  confidentiality  requirements,  in  a  timely  manner  and  in  an agreed format to all members of these organizations and other interested parties in accordance with agreed procedures.

## 7.5 Precautionary approach

- 7.5.1 States  should  apply  the  precautionary  approach  widely  to  conservation, management and exploitation  of  living  aquatic  resources  in  order  to  protect  them and preserve the aquatic environment. The absence of adequate scientific information  should  not  be  used  as  a  reason  for  postponing  or  failing  to  take conservation and management measures.
- 7.5.2 In implementing  the  precautionary  approach,  States  should  take  into account, inter alia, uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference  points,  stock  condition  in  relation  to  such  reference  points,  levels  and distribution  of  fishing  mortality  and  the  impact  of  fishing  activities,  including discards, on non-target and associated or dependent species as well as environmental and socio-economic conditions.
- 7.5.3 States and subregional or regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements should, on the basis of the best scientific evidence available, inter alia , determine:

- a) stock specific target reference points, and, at the same time, the action to be taken if they are exceeded; and
- b) stock specific limit reference points and, at the same time, the action to be taken  if  they  are  exceeded;  when  a  limit  reference  point  is  approached,  measures should be taken to ensure that it will not be exceeded.
- 7.5.4 In the case of new or exploratory fisheries, States should adopt as soon as possible  cautious  conservation  and  management  measures,  including, inter  alia , catch limits and effort limits. Such measures should remain in force until there are sufficient data to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the long-term sustainability  of  the  stocks,  whereupon  conservation  and  management  measures based  on  that  assessment  should  be  implemented.  The  latter  measures  should,  if appropriate, allow for the gradual development of the fisheries.
- 7.5.5 If  a  natural phenomenon has a significant adverse impact on the status of living aquatic resources, States should adopt conservation and management measures on an emergency basis to ensure that fishing activity does not exacerbate such adverse impact. States should also adopt such measures on an emergency basis where  fishing  activity  presents  a  serious threat to the sustainability of such resources. Measures taken on an emergency basis should be temporary and should be based on the best scientific evidence available.

## 7.6 Management measures

- 7.6.1 States  should  ensure  that  the  level  of  fishing  permitted  is  commensurate with the state of fisheries resources.
- 7.6.2 States  should  adopt  measures  to  ensure  that  no  vessel  be  allowed  to  fish unless so authorized, in a manner  consistent with international  law  for the  high seas or in conformity with national legislation within areas of national jurisdiction.
- 7.6.3 Where excess fishing capacity exists, mechanisms should be established to reduce  capacity  to  levels  commensurate  with  the  sustainable  use  of  fisheries resources  so  as  to  ensure  that  fishers  operate  under  economic  conditions  that promote  responsible  fisheries.  Such  mechanisms  should  include  monitoring  the capacity of fishing fleets.
- 7.6.4 The performance of all existing fishing gear, methods and practices should be examined and measures taken to ensure that fishing gear, methods and practices

which are not consistent with responsible fishing are phased out and replaced with more acceptable alternatives. In this process, particular attention should be given to the  impact  of  such  measures  on  fishing  communities,  including  their  ability  to exploit the resource.

- 7.6.5 States  and  fisheries  management  organizations  and  arrangements  should regulate fishing in such a way as to avoid the risk of conflict among fishers using different vessels, gear and fishing methods.
- 7.6.6 When  deciding  on  the  use,  conservation  and  management  of  fisheries resources,  due  recognition  should  be  given,  as  appropriate,  in  accordance  with national  laws  and  regulations,  to  the  traditional  practices,  needs  and  interests  of indigenous  people  and  local  fishing  communities  which  are  highly  dependent  on fishery resources for their livelihood.
- 7.6.7 In  the  evaluation  of  alternative  conservation  and  management  measures, their cost-effectiveness and social impact should be considered.
- 7.6.8 The efficacy of conservation and management measures and their possible interactions  should  be  kept  under  continuous  review.  Such  measures  should,  as appropriate, be revised or abolished in the light of new information.
- 7.6.9 States should take appropriate measures to minimize waste, discards, catch by  lost  or  abandoned  gear,  catch  of  non-target  species,  both  fish  and  non-fish species,  and  negative  impacts  on  associated  or  dependent  species,  in  particular endangered  species.  Where  appropriate,  such  measures  may  include  technical measures  related  to fish size, mesh size or gear, discards, closed seasons and areas and  zones  reserved  for  selected  fisheries,  particularly  artisanal  fisheries.  Such measures should be applied, where  appropriate, to protect juveniles  and spawners. States and sub-regional or regional fisheries management  organizations and arrangements should promote, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environ-mentally safe and cost effective gear and techniques.
- 7.6.10 States  and  subregional  and  regional  fisheries  management  organizations and  arrangements,  in  the  framework  of  their  respective  competences,  should introduce  measures  for  depleted  resources  and  those  resources  threatened  with depletion  that  facilitate  the  sustained  recovery  of  such  stocks.  They  should  make every effort to ensure that  resources and  habitats critical  to the  well-being of such resources  which have been adversely affected  by fishing or other human activities are  restored.

## 7.7 Implementation

- 7.7.1 States should ensure that an effective legal and administrative framework at the  local  and  national  level,  as  appropriate,  is  established  for  fisheries  resource conservation and fisheries management.
- 7.7.2 States  should  ensure  that  laws  and  regulations  provide  for  sanctions applicable  in  respect  of  violations  which  are  adequate  in  severity  to  be  effective, including  sanctions  which  allow  for  the  refusal,  withdrawal  or  suspension  of authorizations  to  fish in the event  of  non-compliance  with  conservation  and management measures in force.
- 7.7.3 States, in conformity with their national laws, should implement effective fisheries monitoring, control, surveillance and law enforcement measures including, where appropriate, observer programmes, inspection schemes and vessel monitoring systems.  Such measures should be  promoted and, where appropriate, implemented by subregional or regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements in accordance with procedures agreed by such organizations or arrangements.
- 7.7.4 States and subregional or regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, as appropriate, should agree on the means by which the activities of such organizations and arrangements will be financed, bearing in mind, inter alia , the relative benefits derived from the fishery and the differing capacities of countries to provide financial and other contributions. Where  appropriate, and when possible, such  organizations  and  arrangements  should  aim  to  recover  the  costs  of  fisheries conservation, management and research.
- 7.7.5 States  which  are    members  of  or  participants    in  subregional  or  regional fisheries  management  organizations    or  arrangements  should  implement  internationally  agreed  measures  adopted  in  the  framework  of  such  organizations  or arrangements and consistent with international law to deter the activities of vessels flying the flag of non-members or non-participants which engage in activities which undermine the effectiveness  of conservation and management measures established by  such organizations or arrangements.

## 7.8 Financial institutions

- 7.8.1 Without  prejudice  to  relevant  international  agreements,  States  should encourage banks and financial institutions not to require, as a condition of a loan or mortgage, fishing vessels or fishing support vessels to be flagged in a jurisdiction other    than  that    of  the  State  of    beneficial  ownership  where    such  a  requirement would

have  the  effect  of  increasing  the  likelihood  of  non-compliance  with  international conservation and management measures.

## BACKGROUND TO THE ORIGIN AND ELABORATION OF THE CODE

- 1. This  annex  describes  the  process  of  elaboration  and  negotiation  of  the Code, which led to its submission for adoption to the Twenty-eighth Session of the FAO Conference. It has peen felt useful to annex this section as a reference to the origin and the development of the Code and thus reflect the interest generated and the spirit of compromise of all the parties involved in its elaboration. It is hoped that this will contribute to the promotion of the commitment  necessary  for its implementation
- 2. At various international fora, concern had 'long been expressed regarding the clear signs of over-exploitation of important fish stocks, damage to ecosystems, economic losses, and issues affecting fish trade - all of which threatened the longterm sustainability of fisheries and, in turn, harmed the contribution of fisheries to food  supply.  In  discussing  the  current  state  arid  prospects  of  world  fisheries,  the Nineteenth  Session  of  the  FAO  Committee  on  Fisheries  (COFI),  held  in  March 19111, recommended that FAO should develop the concept of responsible fisheries and elaborate a Code of Conduct to this end.
- 3. Subsequently,  the  Government  of  Mexico,  in  collaboration  with  FAO, organized an International Conference oil Responsible Fishing in Cancún, in May 1992. The Declaration of Cancún endorsed at that Conference further developed the concept of responsible fisheries, stating that "this concept encompasses  the sustainable utilization of fisheries resources to harmony with the environment; the use  of  capture  and  aquaculture  practices  which  are  not  harmful  to  ecosystems, resources or their quality; the incorporation of added value to such products through transformation  processes  meeting  the  required  sanitary  standards;  the  conduct  of commercial practices so as to provide consumers access to good quality products'.
- 4. The Cancún Declaration was brought to the attention of the UNCED Rio Summit in June 1992, which supported the preparation of a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, The FAO Technical Consultation on High Seas Fishing, held in September 1992, further recommended the elaboration of a Code to address the issues regarding high seas fisheries.
- 5. The  one  hundred  and  Second  Session  of  the  FAO  Council,  held  in November 1992, discussed the elaboration of the Code, recommending that priority be given to high seas issues and requested that proposals for the Code be presented to the 1993 session of the Committee on Fisheries.

- 6. The  Twentieth  Session  of  COFI,  held  in  March  1993,  examined  general principles for such a Code, including the elaboration of guidelines and endorsed a timeframe for the further elaboration of the Code. It also requested FAO to prepare, on a "fast track" basis, as part of the Code, proposals to prevent reflagging of fishing vessels which affect conservation and management measures on the high seas.
- 7. The further development of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries was accordingly carried out in consultation and collaboration with relevant United Nations Agencies and other international organizations including non-governmental organizations.
- 8. In  pursuance  of  the  instructions  of  the  FAO  Governing  Bodies,  the  draft Code was formulated in such a way as to be consistent with the 1982 United Nations Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea,  taking  into  account  the  1992  Declaration  of Cancun, the 1992 Rio Declaration and the provisions of Agenda 21 of UNCED, the conclusions and recommendations of the 1992 FAO Technical Consultation on High Seas  Fishing,  the  Strategy  endorsed  by  the  1984  FAO  World  Conference  on Fisheries Management and Development, and other relevant instruments including the  outcome  of  the  then  ongoing  United  Nations  Conference  on  Straddling  Fish Stocks  and  Highly  Migratory  Fish  Stocks  which,  in  August  1995,  adopted  an Agreement  for  the  Implementation  of  the  Provisions  of the United  Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Concerning Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.
- 9. The FAO Conference, at its  Twenty-seventh  Session  in  November  1993, adopted the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas and recommended  that the  General    Principles  of  the  Code  of  Conduct  for    Responsible  Fisheries  be prepared  on  a  "fast  track"  in  order  to  orientate  formulation  of  thematic  articles. Accordingly,  a  draft  text  of  the    General  Principles  was  reviewed  by  an  informal Working Group of  Government nominated experts, which met in Rome in February 1994.  A  revised  draft  was  widely  circulated  to  all  FAO  Members  and  Associate Members  as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. Comments  received on the second version of the General Principles were incorporated in the draft Code together with proposals for  an alternative text. This document  was  also  the    subject  of'  informal  consultation  with  non-governmental organizations on  the occasion  of the Fourth  Session  of the United  Nations Conference  on  Straddling  Fish  Stocks  and  Highly  Migratory  Fish  Stocks,  held  in August 1994 in New York.
- 10. In  order  to  facilitate  consideration  of  the  full  text  of  the  draft  Code,  the Director-General proposed to the Council at its Hundred  and Sixth Session in

June 1994, that a Technical Consultation on the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing be organized, open to all FAO  Members,  interested non-members, intergovernmental  and  non-governmental  organizations,  in  order  to  provide  an opportunity for the widest involvement of all concerned parties at an early stage of its elaboration.

- 11. This Technical Consultation took place in Rome from 26 September to 5 October 1994 and a draft for the entire Code and a first draft of technical guidelines to support most of the Thematic Articles of the Code were presented. Following a thorough  review  of  all  the  Articles  of  the  complete  draft  Code  of  Conduct,  an Alternative  Secretariat  Draft  was  then  prepared  on  the  basis  of  comments  made during the discussions in plenary and specific drafting changes submitted in writing during the Consultation.
- 12. The Consultation was able to review also in detail an alternative draft for three  of  the  six  Thematic  Articles  of  the  Code,  i.e.,  Article  9  "Integration  of Fisheries  into  Coastal  Area  Management",  Article  6  "Fisheries  Management", Article 7 "Fishing Operations", except for those principles which were likely to be affected by the outcome of the ongoing UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. A short Administrative Report was prepared and presented to the FAO Council and to COFI.
- 13. The  Technical  Consultation  proposed  to  the  Council  at  its  Hundred  and Seventh Session, 15-24 November 1994, that the final wording of those principles dealing mainly with high seas issues be left in abeyance pending the outcome of the UN  Conference.  The  Council  generally  endorsed  the  proposed  procedure,  noting that  following  discussions  at  the  next  session  of  COFI,  a  final  draft  of  the  Code would be submitted to the FAO Council in June 1995 which would then decide upon the  necessity  for  a  Technical  Committee to  meet in parallel to that Session of the Council in order to elaborate further the detailed provisions of the Code if required.
- 14. Based upon the substantial comments and detailed suggestions received at the Technical Consultation, the Secretariat elaborated a revised draft of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which was submitted to the Twenty-first Session of the Committee on Fisheries, held from 10 to 15 March 1995.
- 15. The Committee on Fisheries was also informed that the UN Conference   was  expected  to  conclude  its  work  in  August  1995.  It  was  proposed that    principles  left  in    abeyance  in    the  draft  text  of  the    Code  could  then  be reconciled  with  the language   agreed upon at the UN Conference in accordance with a  mechanism to  be decided upon by the Committee and the Council, before

submission of the complete Code for its adoption at the Twenty-eighth Session of the FAO Conference in October 1995.

- 16. The  Committee  was  informed  of  the  various  steps  the  Secretariat  had undertaken in preparing the draft Code of Conduct. The Committee established an open-ended  Working  Group  in  order  to  review  the  draft  text  of  the  Code.    The Working  Group,  which  met  from  10  to  14  March  1995,  undertook  a  detailed revision of the draft Code in continuation of the work carried out by the Technical Consultation. It completed and approved the text of Articles 8 to 11. In view of the time constraints, the Working Group provided directives to the Secretariat to redraft Articles  1  to  5.  It  was  also  recommended  that  the  elements  of  research  and cooperation as well as aquaculture be included in Article 5, General Principles, to reflect issues developed in the Thematic Articles of the Code.
- 17. The  Committee  supported  the  proposal  endorsed  by  the  Hundred  and Seventh  Session  of  the  Council  oil  mechanism;  to  finalize  the  Code.  The  final wording of those principles dealing mainly With issues concerning straddling fish stocks  and  highly  migratory  fish  stocks,  ,which  formed  only  a  small  part  of  the Code, should be re-examined in the light of the outcome of the UN Conference. The Group  also  recommended  that  once  agreement  was  reached  on  the  substance,  it would be necessary to harmonize legal, technical and idiomatic aspects of the Code, in order to facilitate its final approval.
- 18. The  Report  of  tile open-ended  Working  Group  was  presented  to  a Ministerial  Meeting  on  Fisheries,  held  on  14  and  15  March  1995,  in  conjunction with the COFI Session. The Rome Consensus oil World Fisheries emanating from this  meeting urged that "Governments and international organizations take prompt action to complete the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries with a view to submitting the final text to the FAO Conference in October 1995"
- 19. The  Hundred  and  Eighth  Session  of  the  Council  was  presented  with  a revised  version  of  the  Code  of  Conduct.  The  Council  established  an  open-ended Technical Committee, which held its First Session from 5 to 9 June 1995, with a broad regional representation of members and observers. A number of intergovernmental and  non-governmental organizations also participated.
- 20. The  Council  was  informed  by  the  Technical  Committee  that  it  had undertaken a thorough review of Articles 1 to 5 including the Introduction. It had also  examined,  amended  and  approved  Articles  8  to  11.  The  Council  was  also informed that the Committee had started the revision of Article 6.

- 21. The  Council  approved  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Technical  Committee and  endorsed  its  recommendation  for  a  Second  Session  to  he  held  from  25  to  29 September  1995  to  complete  the  revision  of  the  Code  once  the  Secretariat  had harmonized the text linguistically and juridically, taking into account the outcome of the UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.
- 22. A revised version of the Code as approved by the Open-ended Technical Committee at its First Session (5-9 June 1995) and endorsed by the One Hundred and Eighth Session of the Council was issued, both as a Conference document (C 95/20) and as a working paper for the Second Session of the Technical Committee. Elements pending agreement were clearly identified.
- 23. In  order  to  facilitate  the  finalization  of  the  entire  Code,  the  Secretariat prepared the document "Secretariat Proposals for Article 6, Fisheries Management, and  Article  7, Fishing  Operations,  of  the  Code  of  Conduct  for  Responsible Fisheries",  taking  into  account  the  Agreement  relating  to  the  Conservation  and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, adopted by the UN Conference in August 1995. The Secretariat also completed proposals for the harmonization of the text on legal and linguistic aspects and made this available to the Committee in three languages for the session (English, French and Spanish).
- 24. A Second Session of the Open-ended Technical Committee of the Council met  from  25  to  29  September  1995,  with  a  wide  representation  of  regions  and interested  organizations.  The  Committee,  working  in  a  full  spirit  of  collaboration, successfully  concluded  its  mandate,  finalizing  and  endorsing  all  Articles  and  the Code as a whole. The Technical Committee agreed that the negotiations of the text of the Code  were  finalized. An  Open-ended  Informal Group  on Language Harmonization  held  an  additional session and, together with the Secretariat, completed  the  harmonization  on  the  basis  of  the  text  as  adopter:  at  the  closing session.  The  Technical  Committee instructed tile Secretariat to already submit the finalized  version  as  a  revised  Conference  document  to  the  Hundred  and  Ninth Session of the Council and to the Twenty-eighth Session of the Conference for its adoption. The Council endorsed the Code of Conduct as finalized by the Technical Committee. The Secretariat was requested to prepare the required draft  resolution for  the  Conference,  including  also  a  call  on  countries  to  ratify,  as  a  matter  of urgency, the Compliance Agreement adopted at the last session of the Conference. The  Twenty-eighth  Session  of  the  Conference  adopted  on    31  October  1995,  by consensus,  the  Code    of  Conduct  for  Responsible  Fisheries  and    the  respective Resolution shown in Annex 2.

## Annex 2

## RESOLUTION

## THE CONFERENCE

Recognizing  the  vital  role  of  fisheries  in  world  food  security,  and  economic  and social  development,  as  well  as  the  need  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  living aquatic resources and their environment for present and future generations,

Recalling  that  the  Committee  on  Fisheries  on  19  March  1991  recommended  the development of the concept of responsible fishing and the possible formulation of an instrument on the matter.

Considering that the Declaration of Cancún, which emanated from the Inter-national Conference on Responsible Fisheries of May 1992, organized by the Government of Mexico  in  collaboration  with  FAO,  had  called  for  the  preparation  of  a  Code  of Conduct on Responsible Fisheries.

Bearing in mind that with the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, and the adoption of the Agreement for the implementation of  the  provisions  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  of  10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks  and  Highly  Migratory  Fish  Stocks,  as  was  anticipated  in  the  1992  Rio Declaration and the provisions of Agenda 21 of UNCED, there is an increased need for  subregional  and  regional  cooperation,  and  that  significant  responsibilities  are placed upon FAO in accordance with its mandate,

Recalling  further  that  the  Conference  in  1993  adopted  the  FAO  Agreement  to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing  Vessels  on  the  high  Seas,  and  that  this  Agreement  would  constitute  an integral part of the Code of Conduct,

Noting with satisfaction that FAO, in accordance with the decisions of its Governing Bodies,  had  organized  a  series  of  technical  meetings  to  formulate  the  Code  of Conduct and that these meetings have resulted in agreement being reached on the text of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,

Acknowledging  that  the  Rome  Consensus  on  World  Fisheries,  which  emanated from the Ministerial Meeting on Fisheries of 14-15 March 1995, urged governments and  international    organizations  to    respond    effectively  to  the    current    fisheries situation, inter alia ,  by   completing   the  Code  of  Conduct  for  Responsible

The remainder of this document includes each section and its clauses, including guidance and conformance ratings for each clause.

## Section 1: Responsible sourcing pre-requisites

Factories (facilities) may source multiple types of raw material; approved or recognised as equivalent by MarinTrust, sourced from an accepted Fishery Improvement Project, or non-approved i.e. raw materials that have not been assessed and successfully passed the requirements of MarinTrust. The requirements of this section are applicable only to MarinTrust raw materials i.e. those included within the scope of the application submitted by the facility.

For non-approved raw materials, the facility shall provide evidence that those species are also not sourced from illegal, unregulated, or unreported (IUU) fishing or include endangered species. This is included in Clause 2.11.3.1, where the facility is required to obtain from its suppliers, a list of all sources of whole fish and by-products and assurance that no raw materials are sourced from IUU fishing or include endangered species.

Section 1 links directly to the initial MarinTrust fishery or by-product assessments which must be conducted before a facility can be audited. Clauses in this section are essential foundations upon which all approved / accepted raw materials are based.

For Section 1, the facility is required to show evidence that it is sourcing approved/accepted raw materials. The auditor will verify this information. If there is no evidence that the facility is sourcing approved / accepted raw materials or that any raw materials are from suspected IUU fishing or endangered species, then this is a critical failure, and the audit shall not continue.

## 1.1. Responsible sourcing

In this Standard to comply with the definition of responsible sourcing, the facility shall be able to demonstrate:

## 2.7 Control of product and process non-conformities

2.7.1

The facility shall have a documented procedure to address non-conformities raised against this Standard.

Guidance

:

Non-conformities can be related to, for example, raw material that has been declared as MarinTrust approved/accepted/recognised equivalent compliant but has been mixed with non-approved/accepted/recognised equivalent raw material, thus losing its integrity. Similarly, non-

conformance can apply to marine ingredients declared as MarinTrust certified when this is not the case.

Other types of non-conformances include food safety issues, loss of traceability, incorrect species labelling etc.

The non-conformance/non-conformance procedure should specify what happens if one of these issues are detected.

## Full conformance

There is a written procedure for how to deal with non-conformances because of being audited against this Standard.

| 2.7.2    | Where nonconforming MarinTrust marine ingredients have been identified, the facility shall ensure these are fully segregated from fully  conforming marine ingredients and disposed of in a legal manner where appropriate.   |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guidance | :   Non-conforming MarinTrust marine ingredients are those related to failures in a specific requirement of the Standard. This can include:                                                                                   |

- · A raw material sourcing failure such as raw materials with chemical or physical contamination, or sourced from IUU fishing, or from suppliers which cannot provide all the required information and levels of assurance regarding the origin of the raw materials.
- · A failure in a product specific issue such as a food safety failure or loss of traceability.
- · A loss of eligibility for MarinTrust labelling i.e. when an approved MarinTrust raw material, or recognised equivalent, has been mixed with non-approved/non-recognised equivalent MarinTrust raw material, thus losing the integrity.

Actions in the event of non-conforming products should be included in the procedure. These include:

- · Where marine ingredients are produced from raw materials sourced from IUU fishing or endangered species these must be completely segregated and disposed of (destroyed as stipulated by the competent authority).
- · In issues relating to the safety of the raw materials and marine ingredients, if the issue cannot be resolved through further processing/rework, the raw materials and marine ingredients should be segregated and disposed of.
- · In situations where there is a loss of traceability or mixing of approved/accepted/recognised equivalent raw materials, with raw materials from non-approved/non-accepted/non-recognised equivalent sources, the marine ingredients shall not be labelled or sold as MarinTrust certified.

## Full conformance

## 2.9 Correction and corrective actions

| 2.9              | The facility shall have procedures for the determination and implementation of corrections and corrective actions in place to ensure that in the  event of any nonconformities:  • the potentially nonconforming products are not released   • the cause of the nonconformity is identified  • corrective actions are determined and implemented through root cause analysis, responsible personnel and timelines specified  • the corrective action is verified to prevent this issue from happening again in the future.   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guidance :       | The facility should define in a procedure how it identifies non-conformances and implements corrective actions. This should include how it  undertakes root cause analysis and how it tackles any non-conformances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                  | Root cause analysis is important to be performed in a way that guarantees that the real cause is identified, and the proper actions are taken to  mitigate the problem.

## 2.11 Supplier approval and monitoring

A definition of suppliers is included in the definitions document, available from the MarinTrust website. It includes suppliers of products or service used by the facility in the direct production of marine ingredients, including but not limited to raw materials, processing aids, antioxidants, packaging. A supplier of agency labour is also included if those workers are working within the facility on the production of marine ingredients.

Further information on requirements for suppliers is included in Annex I, including for countries where facilities can only source whole fish from centrally operated purchasing systems (i.e. countries that can only purchase domestic landings through sites registered / operated by industry with regulatory oversight).

|            | By-product suppliers shall provide assurance to the facility that the by-products are not derived from IUU fishing. This can be through a supplier  policy, as well as through the list of species that are supplied that are not approved/accepted/recognised equivalent by MarinTrust. The facility  can provide the by-product supplier with a list of MarinTrust approved raw material species which the by-product supplier can use for  reference. |
|            | Note: examples of incomplete or inaccurate records are that some of the details are not visible at the time of the audit. Suppliers that have  changed their address or activity without affecting the by-product sourcing, there are missing records: the by-product supplier is unlicensed, or  there is no evidence of documentation for a particular species.                                                                                        |

## Full conformance

All this information is clearly identified for all suppliers of MarinTrust approved by-products used within the facility.

| 2.11.3.2   | For wild-capture by-products identified in the MarinTrust by-product assessment as having a medium risk of coming from IUU fishing activity  (MarinTrust 'Approved Source with Caution'), the facility shall: ·         have supplier agreements for all suppliers of those by-products  ·         obtain assurance from the suppliers that the by-products are not from IUU fishing sources  ·         verify this information with the suppliers                                                                                                                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guidance : | It is important that facilities check with their suppliers regarding their raw materials particularly if there is a perceived risk of sourcing from a  known or suspected IUU fishing activity. This requires checking supplier records or procedures in place to understand how the supplier can  ensure there is no IUU in the raw material they provide. For raw materials risk rated medium, additional, or more frequent checks may be  required until the facility is certain that the raw materials are not from IUU fishing activity.                                   |
|            | By-product suppliers shall provide assurance to the facility that by-products do not stem from IUU fishing.   It is essential that a facility verifies any by-products with its suppliers. This requires the facility to check supplier records and/or procedures to  understand how the supplier ensures there is no by-product from IUU fishing sources. By-product suppliers shall provide assurance to the  facility that the by-products are not derived from IUU fishing. This shall be through the supplier agreement, which must include the list of  species supplied. |
|            | The facility should check the list of by-products sourced from each supplier to identify by-products which are approved/recognised as  equivalent according to MarinTrust requirements. This list can also be checked / updated to facilitate checking of raw materials from IUU  fishing.   For the audit, the auditor will check how the facility manages by-products deemed medium risk. A ny by-products downrated from high to  medium risk will require additional verification. Refer to the byproduct assessment methodology on the MarinTrust website for further      |

## 2.11.4 Third-party suppliers of raw materials

A definition of third-party suppliers is included in the definitions document available from the MarinTrust website. Further details on third-party suppliers are available in Annex 1.

| 2.11.4.1   | MarinTrust compliant raw materials that are purchased via a third-party supplier that does not physically handle or own the raw materials shall  meet all the requirements of this Section (2.11.4) including subclauses.   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guidance   | :   There shall be a list of third-party suppliers of raw material, which may be included as part of the list of suppliers from clause 2.11.1.1.                                                                            |

The third-party suppliers are aware that they must provide information about the whole fish or by-products provided to the facility, to allow traceback of these raw materials to an approved or recognised equivalent source, or from an accepted MarinTrust FIP. The facility shall be able to show requirements of any third-party suppliers including raw materials received and associated records. If the facility does not work with third party suppliers of raw material this section 2.11.4 and subclauses does not apply.

## Full conformance

The facility has documentary evidence that third party suppliers provide all the details required.

Note:  If any clause in Section 2.11.4 receives a non-conformance rating, this clause 2.11.4.1 automatically is a non-conformance.

| 2.11.4.2         | There shall be documented evidence from the suppliers to verify the raw materials are:  • whole fish from either an approved whole fish fishery and/or MarinTrust recognised equivalent fishery, or from aquaculture  • by-products from approved wild capture by-product species and/or MarinTrust recognised equivalent by-product species, or from  aquaculture  • sourced from an accepted MarinTrust Fishery Improvement Project (FIP)   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guidance         | :   The third-party supplier can provide information for each type of raw material supplied to confirm it is from an approved, recognised, or  accepted source. This is essential to allow traceback of raw materials to the respective source.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Full conformance

There is evidence that all third-party suppliers have been informed of the requirement to keep raw materials from a MarinTrust approved fishery or byproduct and/or from a MarinTrust recognised equivalent fishery or by-product separate from other raw materials, including those from an accepted MarinTrust Fishery Improvement Project (FIP).

## Section 5: Good manufacturing practices

A facility can demonstrate good manufacturing practices (GMP) through other means, for example, through recognised certification to another standard or third-party audit. Where applicable, these separate approvals/certifications may be used to demonstrate compliance to certain parts of this Section 5. These separate approvals/certifications are specified in the section headings (5.1, 5.2).

A facility with certification approved as equivalent by MarinTrust recognition procedures shall meet all the requirements of section 5.1.

For auditing purposes, facilities must be able to show copies of their certificates and scope to the auditor.

Refer to the MarinTrust website for further information on the recognition procedure and for a list of recognised standards / certifications.

## 5.1 A facility with certification approved as equivalent by MarinTrust recognition procedures

A facility with certification approved as equivalent by MarinTrust recognition procedures shall meet all the requirements of Section 5.1.

| 5.1.1 Certification shall be administered by one of the following:  • a Certification Body with its scope of accreditation that includes the recognised equivalent  • a standard certification process that has been approved by the MarinTrust equivalency procedure  • a standard that is recognised by a benchmarking tool that has been approved by the MarinTrust equivalency procedure   Guidance   |

| Guidance         | For production areas where water is used in direct contact with the raw materials or products, it is essential it is of potable standard. However,  water used for other purposes e.g. steam production (use in boilers), is not mandatory to be potable.  Note: Some facilities use osmosis and chlorination systems to achieve the desired results which will be acceptable. |

5.3.8.4

Environmental analysis for relevant microorganisms shall be carried out in storage areas according to the HACCP based risk assessment.

Guidance

:

The HACCP risk assessment will identify if storage areas are at risk of causing contamination of marine ingredients. For example, if there are open storage areas, or the entry of sources of contamination are not managed. Relevant indicators of contamination should be used, including

which microorganisms are important to monitor. For example, salmonella is an indicator of food safety including marine ingredients, and it should not be present in storage areas or marine ingredients.

Full conformance procedures.

Guidance

:

If the HACCP risk assessment identifies a risk of contamination in the storage areas, environmental analysis is conducted according to a sampling plan.

Samples of all marine ingredients must be retained. As a minimum, it is essential to take samples at the point of dispatch as this covers what  the customer receives. Ideally samples of marine ingredients taken just after production and at point of dispatch are retained to cover all  situations, but this is the decision of the facility.  If the shelf life of the product is longer than six months, the retention of samples over the shelf life of the products should also be considered. |

| Acceptable storage conditions include that the sample containers are sealed, tamper resistant and stored in indirect light, protected from  sources of moisture. Label should not be removable or modified.   |

| Guidance : | Workers are typically employed based on the number of hours worked. These can be set hours each week, or may vary depending on overtime  etc. It is essential that records of hours worked, and rest periods are kept ensuring workers are paid in line with their work  agreement/contract, are not working too many hours and are able to take sufficient rest breaks. |

| Guidance :       | The principle of freedom of association is essential for effective and fair workplaces and is one of the ILO's fundamental labour rights. Facilities  shall permit workers to organise and form employers' and workers' organisations, without any interference.  Representation may be provided by organisations of the employees' own choosing. representation can take different forms either formally or  informally. Examples include employee groups or committees, or nationally recognised worker representative organisations.  Ref: ILO. |
|                  | A facility shall be able to show that it does not impede any worker representation. There are ways that a workplace can demonstrate this. For  example, there may be a written statement demonstrating worker representation in the workplace included within work  agreements/contracts, or in an employee handbook. New employees may be informed about the provisions of worker representation as part  of their induction etc. There can be information provided on posters / noticeboards etc.                                                |

| 7.9.2      | The facility shall have documentation which demonstrates that a clearly identified, named employees' representative and / or  a workers  committee representing the interests of the employees to the management is elected, or appointed, or nominated by all employees, and  recognised by the management.   |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guidance : | Worker representation is typically undertaken by a worker elected by fellow employees. There may be a single worker representative or a  representative group i.e. a workers' committee.                                                                                                                       |

The selection of worker representatives should be undertaken by a workplace ballot. Typically, there is a formal statement / agreement provided by the employer recognising the role and remit of the representative individual or group, and how management will engage with that group.

The facility should also be able to provide information on how the worker representative or committee is recognised by management or how it operates e.g. through a formal group, workplace forum etc.

## Full conformance

There is evidence of either an elected workplace representative OR an elected workplace committee.

AND

There is a recognition agreement of that representative or committee by senior management.

| Guidance | If the preceding sections of this Standard have been effectively implemented, remediation procedures may not be required in practice.  However, they are important to have in place to demonstrate that a facility has a zero-tolerance approach towards modern slavery and  ensures any employees found in this situation are managed in line with best practice and that they are protected.  A remediation policy / procedure provides clarification of how a facility deals with situations if/when the listed forms of severe human rights  or labour rights abuses have been identified. If such a situation ever arises, it is important that the facility is prepared to rectify and remediate  the situation. And most importantly, look after the employee concerned.  Procedures shall specify the types of actions expected for adults and children, such as resolving debts or other forms of bondage, and enabling |

## Annexes

## Annex 1: Suppliers

This Annex summarises the main requirements for managing suppliers.

## Supplier approval

Supplier approval and monitoring is an essential part of due diligence checks and verification.

All facilities will need to have a supplier approval and monitoring system, including a documented and up to date list of suppliers. This applies to suppliers of raw materials and ingredients used directly in the production of marine ingredients.

For each supplier there shall be a supplier agreement covering all the requirements for this MarinTrust standard. A supplier agreement is essential to ensure consistent understanding of what the Facility expects and what the supplier shall provide.

Exclusions: There are some countries in which facilities are only permitted to purchase whole fish from online systems operated by industry organisations / regulators. In these countries, the requirement for suppliers excludes whole fish suppliers. If the facility is purchasing whole fish from other sources, these must be covered by a supplier agreement.

This guidance provides an explanation of what should be covered in supplier agreements, based on the essential requirements of this MarinTrust standard. Additional requirements may be included in supplier agreements.

Requirements for suppliers of raw materials and products/ingredients used directly in the production of marine ingredients

## Annex III: Recognition of GMP and HACCP equivalent requirements

(Section 5)

This Annex provides an overview of the criteria regarding Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and food safety if the facility produces marine ingredients, either for feed and/or for human consumption (i.e., crude fish oil, hydrolysed products, etc.).

It covers the main requirements in section 5 good manufacturing practice that may or may not be audited if the facility has a certification recognised as part of the MarinTrust recognition procedure.

## Recognition of other standards / schemes

MarinTrust has a 'recognised equivalency procedure' to enable other schemes and benchmarking tools to be recognised, thus enabling those to be used as an alternative to facilities being audited against every section of the Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients.

In Section 5, there is a basis for recognising GMP and / or HACCP systems which are approved by national authorities, or third-party certification that includes GMP.

## Demonstration of GMP through other certification

A facility with GMP certification approved as equivalent by MarinTrust recognition procedures shall meet all the requirements of section 5.1.

For auditing purposes, facilities must be able to show copies of their certificates and scope to the auditor. Facilities must be able to demonstrate they have a specific HACCP plan covering all the marine ingredients produced for feed and/or for human consumption.

## Demonstration of HACCP through other certification

A facility may have HACCP plans approved or certified through other means. If there is a third-party certification of HACCP plans for food and/or feed, in facilities where one or both are produced, the facility will not be audited against HACCP section / clauses.

If a facility has third-party HACCP certification:

- · The facility will be audited against section 5.3.
- · The facility will not be audited against section 5.4 and subclauses.
- · The rest of section 5 will not be audited but the auditor will check the pre-requisites if there are specific additional issues regarding feed and/or human consumption marine ingredients.

Facilities without certification to a recognised equivalent standard are required to be audited against the whole of section 5.3 and 5.4. Is essential to have a HACCP plan that is specific to the end use of the marine ingredients i.e. separate HACCP plans for either food or feed use.

## Annex IV: Tolerance for composition of raw material batches Background

For the purposes of MarinTrust certification, it is essential that raw materials are sourced from approved / accepted / recognised equivalent (hereafter 'approved') sources.

MarinTrust has criteria for assessing and approving whole fish and by-products to ensure they are sourced in line with MarinTrust requirements. Section 1 of the Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients (the Standard) covers the sourcing pre-requisites for raw materials.

The ultimate aim is to have all MarinTrust certified marine ingredients produced from approved raw materials. However, variability in species composition of discrete intake events will be dependent on e.g. seasonality, the source fisheries utilised or the type and number of suppliers of the raw material.

It is expected that it may be unavoidable to fully exclude all non-approved species from every batch. On this basis, MarinTrust allows a small percentage of non-approved species in raw materials.

## Assurance for non-approved species in raw materials

A tolerance is provided for situations where the inclusion of non-approved species is unavoidable at certain times in the raw materials supplied. It is not to cover the inclusion of non-approved species on a systematic basis.

Non-approved species shall be sourced in line with Section 1.1, Clauses 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 of the Standard which require they are:

Included on a list of species provided by the supplier.

- · Not sourced from IUU fishing.
- · Not species that:
- o are a marine mammal, reptile, amphibian or bird
- o stem from fisheries that use dynamiting, poisoning and other comparable destructive fishing practices
- o appear in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix 1 or 2
- o are categorised as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

## Exclusions

The following are excluded from the tolerance:

- · Raw materials which have been assessed and which have failed the applicable assessment. For example, any species from a failed whole fish assessment or a high-risk by-product species.

- · Raw materials from different sources or batches which are non-approved / non-accepted / not recognised equivalent which are deliberately mixed with approved/accepted/recognised equivalent raw materials to achieve the tolerance.

## The tolerance levels for raw material

The 'acceptable maximum tolerance' is:

- · 5% for whole fish.
- · 10% for by-products.
- · 10% total for mixed whole fish and by-products (noting whole fish should be the minority).

If the raw material batch is comprised of at least 90% approved by-product, or 90% approved byproduct and whole fish combined, or 95% whole fish raw materials the whole batch shall be classed as approved.

## How the tolerance is calculated

- · The tolerance is based on the total weight of all non-approved species in each batch of raw materials received.
- · The tolerance is not for each individual species.
- · The acceptable maximum tolerance must not be exceeded in a 12-month period (verified by species data in the mass balance).

## Monitoring of raw materials by a facility

It is the responsibility of a facility to monitor the sourcing of its raw materials and to know the types and weight of species received.

As a facility monitors its raw material intake on an ongoing basis, where there is a likelihood of the tolerance being exceeded, the facility shall apply for the species to be formally assessed and approved.

If it is a start of a new fishing season and the tolerance level is exceeded in received raw materials, the facility can apply for extension to scope of application, to include the non-approved species which are over the tolerance limit.

If a received batch has over the tolerance level of non-approved species, the facility can manually remove those non-assessed species to reduce the quantity to below the tolerance level.

## How tolerance levels are assessed during an audit

During an audit, an auditor may identify that the composition of a batch of raw materials may include species that are not covered by a MarinTrust assessment i.e. non-approved.

- 1. The auditor reviews the intake raw materials batch during the audit.
- 2. Based on observations, the auditor records the findings:

Marine Ingredients Certifications Ltd (09357209) | Doc STG-003 - Issued May 2024 -Version 1.0 | Approved by Governing Body Committee Controlled Copy- No unauthorised copying or alteration permitted.

- I. If the non-approved species are less than the maximum tolerance level by weight / volume observed (by the auditor), this is acceptable.
- II. If the weight of non-approved species is deemed to be greater than the maximum tolerance level, the auditor will check the species listed in the annual mass balance provided at the time of the audit. The mass balance is used to check how common it is for the tolerance to be exceeded.
- 3. After checking the annual mass balance, if the tolerance level is exceeded for a non-approved species, the auditor shall record this during the audit.
- 4. The auditor shall notify the facility of the findings.

## Impacts on raw material approval and certification status of marine ingredients

If the quantity of non-approved species remains under the tolerance level, it is acceptable to continue to receive that species and use it in the production of MarinTrust certified marine ingredients. This is on the basis that it continues to satisfy the assurance requirements.

If the tolerance level is exceeded for a non-approved species , it is no longer acceptable for that species to be treated as 'non approved'. This means the non --approved species is no longer able to be included in MarinTrust approved raw materials. The non-approved species which have exceeded the tolerance, must be included in an application to MarinTrust to be formally assessed and approved.

If a facility reaches and exceeds the tolerance level between the dates of audits, the onus is on the facility to apply for the non-approved species to be formally assessed and approved.

If, during an audit, an auditor identifies that a species is over the tolerance level, the facility shall be apprised of the situation i.e. that the raw material is no longer classified as MarinTrust approved. From that point onwards, any marine ingredients produced from raw materials containing these species shall not be labelled or sold as certified until the over tolerance species is successfully assessed.

The auditor cannot apply this retrospectively.

If the facility believes the auditor is incorrect, it can submit further evidence to the certification body.

## Content of marine ingredients

The tolerance is not applicable to marine ingredients, only the raw materials supplied.

The maximum accepted tolerance will lead to a percentage of the marine ingredients coming from nonapproved raw materials, albeit still sourced with levels of assurance.

It is not permitted to deliberately blend or mix separate batches of certified and non-certified marine ingredients and sell them as certified. This automatically disqualifies those marine ingredients from being sold as MarinTrust certified.

Further information on what claims may be made are available from the 'Guidelines' page on the MarinTrust website, which includes guidance on claims and logo use.

## Future outlook

In the long term it is envisaged that tolerance levels will be reduced and/or eliminated wherever possible.

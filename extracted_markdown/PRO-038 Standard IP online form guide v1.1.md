- · 1.1: The first question is: 'Are you applying for the MarinTrust Standard, the MarinTrust Improver Programme, or both?' Please read up on both the Standard and the Improver Programme below if you are unsure how to answer this question. Be aware that you should only select 'Both' if you are applying for the Standard but are including an accepted Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) in your raw material sourcing.
- o The MarinTrust Standard: https://www.marin-trust.com/marintrust-factorystandard
- o The MarinTrust Improver Programme: https://www.marin-trust.com/improverprogramme
- o Accepted FIPs: https://www.marin-trust.com/programme/improverprogramme/accepted-fips-marintrust-ip
- · 1.2 - 1.4: You will now need to answer three Yes/No questions relating to the raw materials used in your company's production: whole fish, wild caught by-products, and aquaculture.

<!-- image -->

- · 1.5 - 1.6: The next two questions relate to subcontracted and storage facilities. A subcontractor is a third party or affiliate that is appointed under a contract or agreement to carry out work on MarinTrust compliant material only for the applicant. Please ensure that you differentiate between subcontracted storage facilities and storage facilities which are owned by the company.
- o Subcontracted facilities can be used for the following activities: Storage/Packing/Labelling/Transport. The vast majority of Standard certified facilities use subcontracted facilities for storage.
- o Company-owned storage facilities are facilities that have a different address from the main production facility or facilities .
- · 1.7: You will also need to upload some documents relating to your company's operation: an organigram, a process flow chart, and a description of product specification - fishmeal, fish oil and other marine ingredients you may upload multiple documents here . You can upload any other relevant documents under 'Further documents'. Remember to tick 'Check this box when your answer is complete' before clicking 'Next section'.

<!-- image -->

## 1.4 Facilities and Subcontractors

- · 2.1: In this section you will need to provide details of the key contact for the facility.
- · 2.2: In this section you will need to add contact details for the facility, and information about the marine ingredients that are produced there. If the facility produces 'other' marine ingredients (i.e. not fishmeal or fish oil), please provide these details in the relevant box.
- · 2.3 &amp; 2.4: If you ticked 'Yes' in the previous section to the questions about subcontracted and company-owned storage facilities, then you will be asked to provide further information about these facilities here too.
- · Please remember to tick 'Check this box when your answer is complete' after completing each question and before continuing to the next section.

## 1.5 Raw Material Sourcing

The information you are required to enter here depends on how you answered the questions in 'Structure and Operations'. For example, if you selected that you source from whole fish in 'Structure and Operations', you will be required to fill out the whole fish table.

<!-- image -->

## Whole fish

- · To add a whole fish fishery, click 'Add row' in the table. The menu on the right-hand side displays all the whole fish fisheries that MarinTrust has on record for your country. If the fishery you require is here, click on it and add in further information - including catching method and competent authority contact details.
- · Please confirm whether or not the fishery is MSC certified in the dropdown box. If yes, please provide the relevant certificate number.
- · Please be mindful of the 'approval status' dropdown. Just because the fishery is in our database does not mean that it is automatically MarinTrust approved. Please check the approved whole fish fisheries page on the website. If it is present on this page select 'MarinTrust approved', if not, select 'MarinTrust assessment required'. If the fishery is MSC certified and has already been verified by MarinTrust, please select 'MarinTrust approved'. If the fishery is MSC certified but has not been verified by MarinTrust, please select 'MarinTrust MSC verification required'.
- o MarinTrust approved whole fish: https://www.marin-trust.com/marintrust-factorystandard/approved-whole-fish
- o MarinTrust MSC verification reports: https://www.marin-trust.com/marintrustfactory-standard/msc-verification-reports
- o MSC verification FAQ: https://www.marin-trust.com/marintrust-factorystandard/msc-verification-reports/msc-verification-faq
- · If the fishery you require is not present on this list, click 'Raw materials not listed'. Now enter the species and fishing area of the fishery you require. Enter the additional details as above.
- · Remember to click 'Done' in the side menu when you have entered all the fishery information.
- · If the species and fishing area are not present in our databases, you can enter the details of the fishery you require in the box below the table.
- · If you are applying for the Improver Programme, please enter details of the FIP in the box below the table:
- o Accepted FIPs: https://www.marin-trust.com/programme/improverprogramme/accepted-fips-marintrust-ip

## Wild caught by-products

- · To add wild caught by-product raw material sources, click 'Add row' in the table. Adding a row will give you the option to select a by-product entry from the MarinTrust database for your country. If you cannot find the by-product you require, click 'Raw materials not listed' and select from the species and fishing area available. In both cases you will also need to add details about the flag country or countries. Version 3 of the Standard has introduced changes to the approval process for wild caught by-products. As such, if this is the first time you are applying against Version 3, please select the following approval status for all byproduct species: 'MarinTrust assessment required'. This is subject to change once the Version 3 transition period is over.
- · If the species and fishing area are not in our database, you can enter the details of the byproduct you require in the box below the table.

## Aquaculture

- · For aquaculture, you simply need to click 'Add row' in the table, select a species, click 'Continue' and then enter the country of origin. If the species is not present in our database, you can enter the details in the box below the table.
- · If any of the rows in the tables are blank or incorrect, click back into the entry and scroll down in the side menu and click 'Delete'.
- · Remember to tick 'Check when your answer is complete' at the bottom of each table before clicking 'Next section'.

<!-- image -->

- · On the overview page, all relevant progress bars should now be green. If any are orange, please click on the progress bar to complete the question. Progress bars which are white refer to questions which are not relevant to your application - for example, if in Structure and Operations you ticked that you do not source from aquaculture then the third progress bar in Raw Material Sourcing will be white to indicate that the aquaculture table was not required.
- · Assuming all progress bars are green, click 'Submit' at the bottom of the page. You will receive an email to confirm submission, and you will see the message 'Application is awaiting review by MarinTrust' beneath the application form link(s) on the application homepage.

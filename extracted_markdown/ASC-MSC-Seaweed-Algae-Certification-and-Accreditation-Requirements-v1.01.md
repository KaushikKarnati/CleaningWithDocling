## Responsibility for these requirements

The Seaweed Standard Committee (SSC) of the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) advises the ASC and the MSC Boards (ASC Supervisory Board and MSC Board of Trustees) on this document's content. The ASC and the MSC Boards hold responsibility for this document.

## About this document

This document specifies the mandatory requirements that Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) must follow when carrying out audits of seaweed production units who wish to make a claim that the seaweed product/s they produce are from well-managed and sustainable source/s, as defined by the ASC-MSC Seaweed (Algae) Standard.

Part A provides general requirements relating to CABs offering certifications against the ASC-MSC Seaweed (Algae) Standard, while Part B provides specific operational requirements for CABs conducting seaweed production unit audits. The numbering of the sections follows the ISO 17065 approach.

## Standard development process

The ASC and the MSC have developed a joint standard to certify sustainable and responsible seaweed production units under a single certification system. In accordance with the ISEAL Standard Setting Code, the Standard was developed following a participatory process. A joint governance body, the Seaweed Standard Committee, comprising representatives from the ASC and MSC Technical Advisory Groups, Boards, and additional seaweed industry and NGO stakeholders was formed to guide the standard's development. Joint procedures were developed to ensure a robust, credible process. Notably, stakeholder workshops were held in Indonesia, Japan and China. Two 60-day online consultations were held to seek views on drafts of the Standard and associated assessment process. These were supported by webinars, meetings and local outreach to the seaweed industry and affected stakeholders. Academics provided detailed technical input and a workshop was held with Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) in London.

## Implementation

The Seaweed (Algae) Standard v1.0 ('the Standard' thereinafter) and the Seaweed (Algae) Certification and Accreditation Requirements v1.0 ('the CAR' thereinafter) were approved by the ASC Supervisory Board and the MSC Board of Trustees in July-August 2017. The Standard was published 22 November 2017 and is effective from 1 March 2018. Seaweed production units who wish to enter assessment against the Standard can apply from 1 March 2018, or earlier subject to approval by the ASC-MSC.

## Standard review

The CAR will be reviewed 12 months after the effective date to evaluate the implementation of the program and incorporate outcomes of planned program improvements. Certificate holders will be

required to comply with the most recent version of the Standard and the CAR at recertification (i.e. three years after first certification).

Subsequent reviews of the Standard will occur at least every five years to ensure they continue to be relevant and effective in meeting their stated objectives in accordance with the ISEAL Standard Setting Code.

The ASC-MSC welcomes comments on the Standard and CAR at any time. Comments will be incorporated into the next review process. Please submit comments by email to seaweedstandard@msc.org.

Positive discrimination in favour of people from  certain under-represented groups may be legal in some countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Disciplinary practices              | Disciplinary procedures make sure that a company's standards of  conduct and performance at work are followed. They also provide a fair  and humane method of dealing with workers who fail to meet these  standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## 4 General requirements

## 4.1 Requirements of accreditation

- 4.1.1 The CAB shall have its application for accreditation approved by the ASC-MSC's seaweed accreditation body prior to selling certification services for the scope of the Standard.
- 4.1.1.1 In cases where the CAB is already accredited for ASC farm or MSC fishery, they shall apply for a scope extension and inform the accreditation body before announcing the first audit.

## Guidance 4.1.1.1

The accreditation body will treat seaweed as a scope extension. Where this happens, the accreditation body will undertake a desk review and a risk assessment to decide whether the first seaweed audit undertaken by the CAB should be witnessed by the accreditation body.

- 4.1.2 The CAB shall only award certificates once it is accredited and only within the scope of its accreditation.
- 4.1.3 The CAB shall recognise that certificate holders that have been certified by other accredited CABs conform to the Standard.
- 4.1.3.1 If a CAB believes that the recognition of a certificate issued by another CAB is not warranted, they should write to the accreditation body detailing their concerns.
- 4.1.4 The CAB shall authorise the accreditation body to publish on its website, the CAB's company name, full address and contact persons' details.
- 4.1.5 The CAB shall authorise the accreditation body to publish, including on its website, witness assessment and desk review reports.

## 4.2 Conformity to ISO 17065 and the ASC-MSC seaweed requirements

- 4.2.1 The CAB shall conform to the requirements of ISO 17065 and all other ASC-MSC requirements relevant to the scope of accreditation applied for or held.
- 4.2.1.1 The CAB shall conform to the ASC-MSC requirements specified in this document in case of conflict with ISO 17065.
- 4.2.2 In line with ISO 17065 on public information, the CAB shall make available on request the following information on the fees charged to clients:
- a. An indicative average man-day rate.

## Guidance 4.2.2.a

For example, the CAB could calculate this using all seaweed audits carried out over the past year.

- b. The criteria used for determining the cost of a seaweed initial, surveillance or recertification audit, such as the production unit size, complexity of the unit of certification, number of target species, location, etc.
- c. Likely additional costs of predictable elements such as report production.
- d. An explanation of how subsistence, travel expenses and auditor rates are calculated on a per project basis.

## Guidance 4.2.2.d

Ways in which these rates might be explained are:

- a. Expenses charged at actual cost without overheads, and unless otherwise specified by the client.
- a. The least expensive means of travel practicable should be used wherever possible.
- b. The daily audit fees charged to the client are based on the rates charged by subcontracted auditors and these rates vary regionally. When using subcontracted auditors, every effort is made to use auditors geographically proximate to the location of the audit to minimise excess travel costs and cost of living discrepancies between the auditors' home location and the location of the audit.
- c. Often, assessors from the developing world or areas distant from North America and Europe have lower rates, which can help to reduce audit costs in those areas.
- 4.2.3 The CAB shall have processes in place to:
- a. Calculate individual quotes for specific seaweed clients in line with these criteria.
- b. State all costs clearly in advance of the client signing the seaweed audit contract.

## Guidance 4.2.3

The intent of this requirement is that all costs are laid out as clearly as possible in advance of the client signing the contract in line with the criteria listed in 4.2.2. This includes day rates for any additional work that may be needed.

## 4.3 Normative appendices

- 4.3.1 The CAB shall follow in full all normative appendices of the CAR where they are required to be used.

## 4.4 ISO 19011

- 4.4.1 The CAB audit personnel shall follow guidance on auditing provided in ISO 19011.

## 4.5 Compliance with legal requirements

- 4.5.1 The CAB shall comply with the legal requirements in the countries in which they operate.
- 4.5.2 Key personnel shall show understanding of applicable legislation and regulations.

## 4.6 Certification decision-making entity

- 4.6.1 In addition to the requirements of ISO 17065 clause 7.6, the CAB's decision-making entity shall authorise any changes to the status of certification including changes to conditions.

## Guidance 4.6.1

ISO 17065 Section 7.6 confirms that it is the CAB decision-making entity that decides whether to certify the production unit.

## 4.7 Communication with the ASC-MSC

- 4.7.1 All CAB communication with the ASC-MSC shall be in English.
- 4.7.2 The CAB shall communicate with the ASC-MSC using the:
- a. Formats specified in this document, or
- b. Online templates on ASC-MSC websites.

- 4.7.3 The CAB shall use the:
- a. Interpretation Request Template to request any interpretations of the Standard or the CAR.
- b. Variation Request Template to request any variations to these normative requirements.
- 4.7.4 The CAB shall be responsible for control of all confidential information submitted to the ASC-MSC as specified in any confidential annexes (see 17.9.4).
- 4.7.5 The CAB shall be responsible for keeping their data entries on the ASC-MSC seaweed database up to date.
- 4.7.6 The CAB shall submit all required information using the ASC-MSC seaweed database. 1

## 4.8 Contract

- 4.8.1 The CAB shall have a written contract with the production unit client seeking certification.
- 4.8.2 Prior to signing a contract, the CAB shall verify that:
- a. The applicant is not already certified.
- b. The applicant has not had a certificate suspended or withdrawn, or has failed a certification audit within the previous 12 months.
- 4.8.2.1 If the applicant is currently certified, the CAB shall follow the certificate transfer requirements in Section 4.12.
- 4.8.2.2 If the applicant has had had a certificate suspended or withdrawn, or has failed a certification audit within the previous 12 months, the CAB shall follow the certificate transfer requirements in 4.12.3 (pre-transfer review) before accepting the new contract.
- 4.8.3 The contract shall be signed prior to commencement of the audit.
- 4.8.4 The contract shall specify:
- a. The deliverables that the CAB will produce.
- b. The expected certification timeline.
- c. That the ASC-MSC retains the right to change the Standard and the CAR and that certification is conditional on conforming to any new or revised requirements within the timeframes established by the ASC-MSC.
- d. That the ASC-MSC shall have full access to all audit products including audit evidence, audit findings, audit reports and confidential information.
- e. That the ASC-MSC shall have the right to observe audits conducted by the CAB.

## 4.12 Transfer of certificates

## Guidance 4.12

A decision to transfer CABs is voluntary by the certificate holder/applicant, unless the CAB issuing the current certificate no longer offers seaweed certification services for whatever reason. In this case, the client must transfer to another CAB to keep the certification.

## Principles for transfers of certificates between CABs

- 4.12.1 A CAB shall only accept a transfer of a certificate holder/applicant if:
- a. The certificate holder has not transferred CABs previously within the period of validity of a certificate.
- b. The certificate is not suspended (if already certified), withdrawn, or cancelled.
- c. All critical conditions have been closed.
- 4.12.2 If any of the conditions in 4.12.1 are not met, the succeeding CAB shall treat the certificate holder/applicant as a new client and repeat the full ASC-MSC initial audit.

## Procedure for transferring a certificate - Pre-transfer review

- 4.12.3 On receiving an application for transfer from a certificate holder/applicant, the succeeding CAB shall:
- a. Work together where practical to exchange information about the audit and certification.
- i. The preceding CAB shall share all the documentation about the certificate holder/applicant (records, including reports and history of conditions, confidential information and annexes) with the succeeding CAB, unless it is provided by the certificate holder.
- b. Review the reasons for the requested transfer.
- c. Conduct a desk-based pre-transfer review to:
- i. Confirm that the certificate holders' activities are within the scope of the succeeding CAB's accreditation.
- ii. Confirm that the certificate is valid (authenticity, duration, scope).
- iii. Confirm that the certificate holder is not suspended.
- iv. Consider any audit and surveillance reports, including any certification conditions.
- v. Become aware of any complaints received and actions taken to address complaints.
- vi. Review any other relevant documentation.
- 4.12.4 Depending on the findings from the pre-transfer review, the succeeding CAB shall decline the contract or accept the contract.

## Procedure for transferring a certificate

- 4.12.5 If the succeeding CAB accepts the contract as per 4.12.4, the succeeding CAB shall agree on a transfer date with the preceding CAB and the certificate holder/applicant on which all rights and obligations for maintaining the certificate shall be passed from the preceding to the succeeding CAB.
- 4.12.5.1 The expiry date of the succeeding certificate shall be the same as the expiry date of the preceding certificate.
- 4.12.5.2 Both CABs shall keep a record of the agreed transfer date.
- 4.12.6 The preceding CAB shall:

- a. Before the transfer date, ensure that all the client's records are up-to-date, including those held on the ASC-MSC seaweed database.
- b. On the transfer date, cancel the certificate.
- i. All obligations of the preceding CAB shall end after the transfer date.
- 4.12.7 The succeeding CAB shall:
- a. At least five days in advance of the transfer date, inform the MSC-ASC of the agreed transfer date.
- b. On the agreed transfer date, issue the new certificate (if relevant) in the ASC-MSC seaweed database.
- c. Continue with the certificate holder's existing surveillance or audit program.
- d. Not change the status of certification including any certification condition, until the next surveillance audit following the requirement in Section 17.23.
- i. For applicants that have not published the Public Comment Draft Report (PCDR) at the time of the transfer, 4.12.7.d does not apply
- 4.12.8 The results of any accreditation body assessment regarding the compliance of the certificate holder with the scheme requirements shall be applicable to the succeeding CAB.
- 4.12.9 If the succeeding CAB considers that a change of certification status and/or conditions should be made before the surveillance audit, the CAB shall treat the certificate holder as a new client and conduct an initial audit.

## Guidance 4.12.9

This is to encourage the client to consider the timing issue in the decision to transfer to another CAB. The initial site visit may be combined with the surveillance site visit if well planned.

## 7.2 Suspension, withdrawal and cancellation

## Guidance 7.2

A seaweed certificate may be suspended by a CAB for the reasons outlined in this section. If the terms of the suspension are not met within the allowed response time, the certificate may be subsequently withdrawn by the CAB.  While a suspension may be lifted by the CAB if the issues are resolved, a withdrawn certificate is permanently withdrawn. When an applicant voluntarily decides to interrupt an assessment and leave the audit process, it is considered a cancellation. The term 'self-suspension' is used when a certificate holder (certified client) voluntarily decides to enter a period of suspension. For example, if a client wishes to remain certified but is not selling certified product at the time, the client may enter self-suspension to temporarily avoid the cost of surveillance audits.

## Suspension of a certified production unit

- 7.2.1 A CAB may suspend or withdraw a certificate for contractual or administration reasons.

## Guidance 7.2.1

Some examples of cases where a CAB may suspend or withdraw a certificate for a contractual or administrative reason include:

No additional requirements to Part A.

## 15 Structural requirements

No additional requirements to Part A.

## 16 Resource requirements

## 16.1 Audit teams

16.1.1 Teams shall include a lead auditor and should include additional team member/s.

## Guidance 16.1.1

The number of auditors in the team may vary depending on the size and nature of the Unit of Assessment. In most cases, two to three auditors that meet the competencies specified in this document, will be needed to form a team. However, for small units of assessment in production categories A, Bii or Cii in Table 2 of the Standard, the team may be composed of only one auditor if he/she meets all the competency requirements in Annex A.

- 16.1.2 Teams shall include member/s that have the experience and expertise outlined in Annex A.
- 16.1.3 When translation services are needed, the CAB shall retain translators that are independent of the client and skilled in translation from the national or local language into the operating language of the audit team.

## 17 Process requirements

## Guidance Section 17

Certification is a multi-step process that includes four major steps:

- a. Pre-audit: A confidential report tells a production unit if it is likely to achieve certification. The report may also be used by the client as a guide to preparing for the initial audit.
- b. Preparation: The client prepares for the initial audit in response to pre-audit findings and other relevant information, including completion of the Client Application Checklist.
- c. Initial audit: This stage includes multiple sub-steps leading to a determination of whether the production unit conforms to the Standard. The process is led by an appointed CAB and its expert team. It involves consulting with stakeholders, reviewing evidence to score the Performance Indicators (PIs), evaluating the production unit, identifying areas where the production unit should strengthen its performance (if needed), and making a draft and then final determination about whether the production unit meets the Standard. This is an intensive process that calls for a high level of information to be provided by the client and other stakeholders.
- d. Post-audit: Surveillance audits are conducted by the appointed CAB.

Production units are encouraged to make the most of certification by marketing products using the ASC and/or MSC logos, supported as necessary by the MSC Chain of Custody Standard for seafood traceability (see the MSC Chain of Custody Certification Requirements).

## 17.1 Pre-audit

- 17.1.1 The objectives of the pre-audit stage are to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the production unit and assess the likelihood of achieving certification.
- 17.1.2 The pre-audit stage is optional.

## Guidance 17.1.2

Pre-audit can identify potential issues, the likelihood of a production unit of meeting the Standard, and/or highlight major barriers to achieving certification. It can also assist the team with its planning of the initial audit. Production units may undertake pre-audits themselves or use CABs, independent consultants or another relevant qualified auditor/organisation.

- 17.1.3 The Pre-Audit Reporting Template can be found at www.asc-aqua.org/seaweed-standard.
- 17.1.4 The process and outcomes of the pre-audit are confidential unless otherwise directed by the client.
- 17.1.5 The CAB shall provide the ASC-MSC with a copy of any Pre-Audit Report/s it has written for the production unit.
- 17.1.6 If the CAB is aware of any other Pre-Audit Report/s written by other parties, it shall inform the ASC-MSC of the report's author.

## 17.2 Initial audit timelines

- 17.2.1 The period from the announcement of the initial audit to the receipt of the Final Report shall be no more than 12 months.
- 17.2.1.1 The CAB shall withdraw the applicant from the audit process following Section 7.2 of Part A, if 17.2.1 is not met.

## 17.3 Confirmation of scope

- 17.3.1 When receiving the application, the CAB shall confirm that the production unit is within scope of the Standard and verify that it is eligible for certification by reference to the scope criteria in Section 2 of the Standard.
- 17.3.2 During the audit/validity of the certificate, the CAB shall withdraw/suspend the production unit from the audit process if it does not continue to meet the scope requirements in Section 2 of the Standard.

## 17.4 Unit of Assessment and Unit of Certification

- 17.4.1 The team shall define the Unit of Assessment (UoA) and the Unit of Certification (UoC) based on information provided by the client and as otherwise available, following the requirements in Section 3 of the Standard.
- 17.4.2 The team shall define if the client will be assessed as a single, multi-site or group arrangement, as defined in Section 4 of the Standard. 2

## Guidance 17.4.2

Group certification will enable groups of farms to apply collectively for certification. Multi-site certification has been designed for clients that own or have full operational control of multiple production sites and wish to have them all certified under a single certificate.

## 17.5 Preparation for initial audit

- 17.5.1 The CAB shall ensure that before the initial audit is announced, the applicant receives the following written information:
- a. Expected scope of audit.
- b. That the traceability system will be evaluated to determine whether the applicant is required to obtain a Chain of Custody certificate in addition to a production unit certificate.
- c. Draft work schedule.
- d. Names and affiliations of proposed team members.
- e. An explanation of the requirement/s for and process of stakeholder consultation.
- f. Sufficient information about the audit process so that the applicant can make proper preparations for the audit.
- i. This shall include the Client Application Checklist, listing the type of information that will be required by the team prior to the site visit

## Guidance 17.5.1.f.i

The intent of this checklist is that the client and the CAB ensure that all the information needed for the audit is currently available, and that the production unit is fully prepared to proceed with the audit. To that end, the checklist will identify the type and extent of data and information that will be made available for the audit, and any actions that have been taken by the production unit to address critical issues raised in a pre-audit.

## 17.6 Notice of initial audit

17.6.1 The CAB shall announce the production unit audit once the CAB has received from the client the completed Client Application Checklist.

## Guidance 17.6.1

To ensure all information required at the outset of an audit is provided and to promote consistency across the programme, the ASC-MSC has developed the 'Client Application Checklist' template, which includes guidance, for the provision of information at the outset of a production unit audit.

If the audit reports include confidential annexes, the CAB shall include an the report.

## 17.10 Site visit - Stakeholder consultation and information collection

- 17.10.1 The team shall carry out the site visit as announced.

## Guidance 17.10.1

The team may require further site visits by one or more team members where information is not available or assembled by the client or stakeholders in time for the first site visit to score the production unit.

- 17.10.2 The site visit shall include visits to both production sites and management locations as necessary to review the impacts and management of the production unit.
- 17.10.2.1 If more than one production system is used (as defined in Table 2 of the Standard), the CAB shall plan and execute the site visit so that each production system is fully assessed.
- 17.10.3 The team shall:
- a. Conduct stakeholder interviews to make sure that the CAB is aware of any concerns or information that stakeholders may have.
- b. Allow private interviews with the team for stakeholders who request one.
- c. Use any information provided in private in conformity with the confidentiality requirements in 5.2.1.

## Additional requirements for Principle 4 and 5

17.10.4 Principle 4 and 5 shall be assessed by a social auditor meeting the competencies set out in Annex A.

17.10.5 The production unit shall be visited to assess compliance with the social requirements.

17.10.6 A minimum sample size of 15% of the workforce employed in the UoA up to a maximum of 40 persons shall be interviewed.

17.10.6.1 Candidates shall be randomly selected for interview allowing for any stratification in the UoA workforce.

## 17.11 Audit findings

## Guidance 17.11

The Standard is defined at two levels (minimum and target). Failing to meet the minimum level triggers a critical condition. Meeting the minimum, but failing to meet the target level, triggers a condition. To achieve certification, any critical condition must be closed out during the audit process, such that all PIs meet at least the minimum level and there shall not be more than the maximum number of conditions allowed in each Principle given in Table 4 of the Standard.

- 17.11.1 After the team has compiled and analysed all relevant evidence, they shall assess the conformance of the UoA against the Performance Indicators (PIs) of the ASC-MSC Seaweed Standard.
- 17.11.2 The team shall follow the requirements in Section 6 of the Standard to determine which PIs are to be scored.

- 17.11.3 For each PI, the team shall:
- a. Discuss evidence together, either in person or remotely.
- b. Evaluate the balance of evidence.
- c. Use their judgement to assign a level following the requirements in this section.
- d. Assign conditions or critical conditions as per Section 17.12 and Section 17.13.

## Guidance 17.11.3

The intent is that the evidence is discussed by the full team appointed by the CAB. Although the team members should discuss the evidence together, the auditor assigned for each Principle should determine the scores for that Principle. Discussions on audit findings may begin at the site visit but may often not be completed until after the team has dispersed, when virtual interactions may be needed (e.g. by teleconference and exchange of emails).

- 17.11.4 The team shall assess all individual PIs against each of the scoring issues at the minimum and target levels.
- 17.11.5 All scoring issues shall meet the minimum levels for the PI to achieve the minimum level.
- 17.11.6 If one or more of the scoring issues does not meet the minimum level:
- a. The PI shall be assigned a critical condition/s as per Section 17.13.

## Guidance 17.11.6

For example, if one scoring issue does not meet the minimum, no further scoring is required for that scoring issue. However, the remaining scoring issues within the PI should still be scored against the minimum and target levels (if relevant).

- 17.11.7 If all the scoring issues within a PI meet the target level, the PI meets the target level and no further action is required.
- 17.11.8 If one or more of the scoring issues meet the minimum level but do not meet the target level, the PI shall be assigned a condition/s as per Section 17.12.
- 17.11.9 The team shall provide a rationale to support the team's conclusion.

17.11.9.1 The rationale shall make direct reference to every scoring issue and whether it is fully met.

- 17.11.10 In Principles 1 or 2, the team shall score all scoring elements (species or habitats) affected by the UoA.
- 17.11.10.1 If any single scoring element fails to meet the minimum level, a critical condition

shall be raised, regardless of the situation of other scoring elements, some of which may be at the minimum or target levels.

17.11.10.2

If any single scoring element meets the minimum level, but fails to meet one or more scoring issue at the target level, the PI shall be assigned the minimum level, and a condition shall be raised, regardless of the situation of other scoring elements, some of which may be at the target level.

## Guidance 17.11.10

In some production units, multiple 'scoring elements' may exist within one PI (such as multiple ETP or bycatch species or habitats). For example, if a production unit has impacts on more than one habitat, each habitat should be scored as a different scoring element.

- 17.11.11 The CAB shall not certify a UoA if any individual scoring issue is not met at least at the minimum level.
- 17.11.12 The CAB shall not certify a UoA if it has more than the number of conditions allowed in each Principle given in Table 4 of the Standard.

## 17.12 Setting conditions

- 17.12.1 The team shall set one auditable condition for continuing certification for each individual PI that achieves the minimum level, but not the target level.
- 17.12.2 The team shall draft conditions to follow the narrative of the scoring issue/s not met.
- 17.12.3 The team shall draft conditions to result in improved performance to the target level normally within not more than one year.
- 17.12.3.1

The timeframe may be extended if the CAB determines that achieving the target level may take longer than one year even if the best possible actions are taken.

- 17.12.4 The team shall create a schedule of conditions stating the specific requirements that are to be met within a specified timeframe, using the Summary of Conditions section of the ASCMSC Seaweed Audit Reporting Template.
- 17.12.4.1 The schedule shall confirm which scoring issues need to be met at the target level in each PI, and for which scoring elements, as applicable.
- 17.12.5 The team shall require the client to prepare a client action plan that includes:
- a. A description of the root cause/s of the condition.
- b. The corrective action/s to be taken and how these will address the condition to meet the target level.
- c. Who will undertake the actions in the plan to meet the conditions.
- d. The specified time period within which the conditions will be addressed.
- e. How progress to meeting conditions will be shown to the CAB.
- f. Funding and/or resources of other entities needed to close the condition.
- 17.12.6 The team shall not accept a client action plan if the client is relying upon the involvement, funding and/or resources of other entities without consulting with those entities when setting conditions.
- 17.12.7 If the team cannot find evidence to show that funding and/or resources are, or will be, in place to address conditions, the UoA shall not be certified.

## Guidance 17.12.7

The involvement of external 'entities' in delivering conditions is commonly required in the MSC program, such as where management agencies need to be involved in developing harvest control rules with stakeholders. Such external involvement would not normally be needed for farms, but must still be considered in each case.

## 17.13 Critical conditions

- 17.13.1 If a scoring issue does not meet the minimum level, the team shall:
- a. Issue a critical condition.
- i. Critical conditions shall be issued using the Critical Condition Reporting Template.
- ii. Critical conditions shall be issued to the client not more than 10 days after the site visit.

## Guidance 17.13.1

The CAB needs to send the Client Draft Report for the client review after the site visit and scoring of the production unit. However, the Summary of Critical Conditions section of the report should be sent before the Client Draft Report, within 10 days after the site visit. The client has a timeline for closing critical conditions (see 17.13.1.b) and the PCDR will not be published until these are closed

- (17.13.2). Failing to close the critical conditions within the specified timeline will mean that the production unit must be withdrawn (7.2.8).
- b. Require that at least the minimum level is met within three months from the date that the Critical Condition Reporting Template is sent to the client.
- i. The team may extend the timeline for a critical condition to a maximum of six months if it determines that achieving the target level may take longer than three months even if the best possible actions are taken.

## Guidance 17.13.1.b.i

Situations which could justify extending the timeline to the maximum six-month duration would normally involve something that is outside the client's control, such as natural disasters, etc.

- c. Decide if another site visit is needed to close the critical condition.
- 17.13.2 All critical conditions shall be closed out before the Public Comment Draft Report (PCDR) is published.

## 17.14 Determining the start of the Chain of Custody

- 17.14.1 The team shall determine if separate Chain of Custody (CoC) certification is required before the first point of sale.
- 17.14.2 The CAB shall review and document, in detail, the flow of certified product from harvest to sale within the UoA and the associated traceability system which allows product to be traced from first point of sale back to the harvesting/culturing facilities in the UoA.
- 17.14.3 This shall include:
- a. The traceability documentation at each stage of handling certified product and how product can be linked from each document (e.g. through batch codes, lot codes, etc.).
- b. A detailed description of the systems used to segregate and identify certified product at each stage of handling.
- 17.14.4 The CAB shall document whether each of the following risks are currently or potentially applicable:
- a. The possibility of mixing or substitution of certified and non-certified product, including product of the same or similar appearance or species, produced within the same UoA.
- b. The possibility of mixing or substitution of certified and non-certified product, type of production/harvest, including product of the same or similar appearance or species, present during production, harvest, transport, storage, or processing activities.
- c. The possibility of subcontractors being used to handle, transport, store, or process certified products.
- d. Any other opportunities where certified product could potentially be mixed, substituted, or mislabelled with non-certified product before the point where product enters the Chain of Custody.
- 17.14.5 For each applicable risk, the CAB shall:
- a. Clearly document the risk.
- b. Describe any traceability, segregation, or other systems in place to manage and minimise the risk.
- 17.14.6 If the CAB determines that any risk factors in 17.14.4 are applicable, a separate chain of custody certification should be required, unless the CAB determines that the traceability and segregations systems in place are sufficient to address the risks and to ensure all products identified and sold as certified originate from the harvesting/culturing facilities in the UoA.

- 17.14.7 If the CAB determines that the traceability and segregation systems are not sufficient, separate CoC certification will be required before the first point of sale, before products can be sold as certified or can be eligible to carry the ASC and/or MSC labels.
- 17.14.8 This determination shall remain in force until revised by the CAB in a subsequent audit or until a valid CoC certification is in place.
- 17.14.9 The CAB shall inform the client if separate CoC certification is required for any entity in the UoA and/or UoC.
- 17.14.10 The same CAB that carried out the seaweed assessment shall conduct all necessary CoC audits and certification within the UoA and/or UoC.
- 17.14.11 The CAB shall clearly document in the audit report the determination and the reasons that separate CoC certification is (or is not) required, including a statement confirming whether products are eligible to enter further chains of custody.
- 17.14.12 If the CAB has determined that the traceability systems are sufficient to allow products to enter chain of custody, the CAB shall document:
- a. The intended point of first sale.
- b. The point from which CoC is required to begin.

## 17.15 Setting the Eligibility Date for under-assessment product

- 17.15.1 During the audit, the CAB shall determine the specific date (Eligibility Date) from which product from the operation is eligible to be sold as ASC-MSC certified or with the MSC and/or ASC labels.
- 17.15.2 The Eligibility Date can be set as either:
- a. The date of the certification of the UoA as specified on the certificate, or
- b. The publication date of the PCDR.
- 17.15.3 The Eligibility Date shall be set as the date of the UoA certification where a determination has been made that separate CoC certification is necessary. The CAB shall:
- a. Record this Eligibility Date clearly in the audit report.
- b. Communicate this date to the client and the ASC-MSC within five days of the determination being made.
- 17.15.4 If the Eligibility Date is set before the certification date, the CAB shall inform the applicant of the requirements for under-assessment products in clause 5.5 of the Standard.

## 17.16 Client Draft Report

- 17.16.1 The CAB shall issue a Client Draft Report to the client once the production unit has been scored and any conditions and the point at which the products from the UoA may enter further chains of custody have been determined.
- 17.16.2 The CAB shall use the ASC-MSC Seaweed Audit Reporting Template to create the report.
- 17.16.3 The report shall include:
- a. All written submissions from stakeholders (if any) received during the audit and a summary of verbal submissions received during the site visit.
- b. Explicit responses from the team to these submissions, stating how stakeholder feedback has been taken into consideration.
- c. Any conditions raised.
- d. Any references used to support statements in the evaluation tables of the reports shall be included in the 'References' section of the table and an in-text reference (e.g. number or author, date, etc.) made to the relevant source.

- 17.16.4 The CAB shall give the client time to:
- a. Provide comments and any objective evidence that would lead to a change in the outcome of the audit and/or conditions raised.
- b. Develop and submit the client action plan to address any conditions raised.
- 17.16.5 If an action plan to address any conditions raised is not received, the production unit shall be withdrawn from audit.
- 17.16.6 Any comments made by the client and the team shall be documented and retained by the CAB and shall be available upon request to any party.
- 17.16.7 The CAB shall be solely responsible for the content of all reports, including the content of any confidential annexes.

## 17.17 Public Comment Draft Report

- 17.17.1 Following the submission of client comments and client action plan and the closure of any critical conditions, where appropriate, the team shall prepare the Public Comment Draft Report (PCDR).
- 17.17.2 The PCDR shall include, in addition to the items specified in Section 17.16:
- a. The action plan prepared by the client to address the conditions raised (if any).

- b. The objection procedure has finished in conformity with Annex B.

## 17.20 Public Certification Report

- 17.20.1 At the end of the audit process, the CAB shall finalise a Public Certification Report that shall incorporate the Final Report and, if relevant, any written decisions arising from any objection/s.
- 17.20.2 The CAB shall use the ASC-MSC Seaweed Audit Reporting Template to create the report.
- 17.20.3 The Public Certification Report shall confirm the CAB's determination to either certify or fail each UoA in the production unit.
- 17.20.4 The Public Certification Report shall state which entities are allowed to use the certificate that is issued to the client.

17.20.4.1

- i. The results of the original audit.
- ii. The date of the original determination not to certify.
- iii. Identify those PIs for which scoring and/or the rationale for scoring has changed from the original audit.

## 17.23 Surveillance

## Surveillance audit timing

- 17.23.1 The CAB shall carry out a surveillance audit, which includes a site visit, to monitor the certificate holder's continued conformity with the Standard at least annually from the date of certificate issuance.

## Guidance 17.23.1

The site visit can take place at the location where the production unit takes place, but it can also be where the client is based. Either location is sufficient if the necessary information can be collected

through face to face meetings with stakeholders, including scientists, managers, client employees and community members.

17.23.2 The CAB shall not conduct the annual surveillance audit earlier or later than six months from the anniversary date of the certificate issuance.

## Preparing for a surveillance audit

17.23.3 The CAB shall submit an announcement of the upcoming surveillance audit for posting on the ASC-MSC website.

17.23.3.1

The announcement shall be posted at least 30 days before the date of the site visit.

17.23.3.2

The announcement shall be prepared using the ASC-MSC Seaweed Audit Announcement Template.

17.23.4 The CAB shall appoint an audit team with expertise that is comparable to the original audit team when conducting surveillance audits.

17.23.4.1

If team members are different to the original team, the selection shall be justified in writing in the Surveillance Announcement and their relevant skills and/or expertise documented.

## Guidance 17.23.4

For instance, if the scope of the surveillance audit will not cover social aspects (P4 and P5), a social auditor may not be needed.

## Surveillance audit activities

17.23.5 During each surveillance site visit, the team shall engage face to face with the client and stakeholders.

- 17.23.6 During each surveillance site visit, the team shall assess:
- a. Changes, if any, to the management system.
- b. The capacity of the management system to manage any change in scope, size or complexity within the certified production unit.
- c. Legal and regulatory compliance, including any changes that have occurred in legislation or regulations.
- d. Changes in science relevant to the fishery.
- e. Any complaints or allegations of non-conformity with the ASC-MSC seaweed requirements.
- f. A sample of sites and records to verify that the management systems are effective and consistent covering any high-risk areas or personnel changes,
- g. Any changes affecting the operation's traceability, Chain of Custody, or the ability to trace certified products back to the unit of certification, and
- h. Progress and performance against outstanding conditions.

The team shall:

- a. Examine relevant objective evidence relating to each condition, including the client's delivery of its client action plan.
- b. Close out the condition only if the PI is found to fully meet the target level.
- c. Provide a rationale for re-scoring the PI and closing out the condition in the Surveillance Report.

## 17.23.7

- 17.23.8 In cases where conditions are not closed out within the specified timelines and are considered behind target, the team should either:
- a. Approve an extension of condition timelines (beyond the normal one-year limit as per 17.12.3.1), or
- i. The team should only approve an extension of condition timelines in cases where it is satisfied, based on objective evidence, that all efforts have been made or are being made by the client to demonstrate conformity.
- ii. The team shall record the justification in the Surveillance Report.
- b. Not approve an extension of condition timelines.
- i. If the team determines that condition timelines should not be changed, the team shall specify the remedial actions including any milestones that are required to bring the condition back on track within 12 months.
- ii. If the team determines that progress against a condition is not back 'on target' within 12 months of falling 'behind target', the team shall apply the requirements related to suspension and withdrawal in Section 7.2.
- 17.23.9 If the requirements of any condition are changed, and/or a score changed, the team shall provide written justification for this in the Surveillance Report.

## Surveillance Audit Report

- 17.23.10 Within 60 days of the completing of the site visit the CAB shall submit to the ASC-MSC a Surveillance Report for posting on the website using the ASC-MSC Seaweed Surveillance Reporting Template.
- 17.23.11 The report shall be in English and the national or most common language spoken in the area where the operation is located.
- 17.23.12 The CAB shall send the surveillance report to the client along with any requests or conditions that may arise from surveillance activities.

## Expedited audits

## Guidance

Additional 'expedited' audits may be held in the special situations outlined in this section. They can take the form of a desk review or include a site visit and can be either announced or unannounced depending on the situation.

- 17.23.13 The CAB shall conduct an expedited audit during an initial assessment or when certified for one or more of the following reasons:
- a. The CAB becomes aware of changes in the production unit that may cause a change in the certification status, and/or
- b. Significant new information becomes available in relation to the circumstances of the fishery, including during the period between the initial site visit and the issue of a certificate, which is likely to be material to the certification status.
- 17.23.14 CABs shall ensure that an onsite audit is only triggered when the information available supports the conclusion that an actual material change has taken place in the status or management of the production unit.
- 17.23.15 The CAB may notify the ASC-MSC by submitting the Announcement Template prior to the audit for posting on the ASC-MSC website.
- 17.23.15.1 For expedited audits that are to be announced, the CAB may submit the Announcement Template to the ASC-MSC fewer than 30 days prior to the audit.
- 17.23.15.2 No announcement shall be published prior to an unannounced audit.

- 17.23.16 The CAB may choose to notify none, some, or all potential stakeholders and interested parties prior to an unannounced audit.

- d. Verify that corrective actions taken allows for the closure of open conditions.

## 17.25 Extension of certificate validity

- 17.25.1 The CAB may extend the validity of a certificate, by up to three months in cases where:
- a. The certificate holder has applied to the CAB for recertification and the application has been accepted by the CAB not later than five days before the end of the period of validity of the certificate,
- b. There would be no product present at the time when the recertification site visit would otherwise be due, and
- c. The CAB issued the previous certificate.
- 17.25.2 The CAB shall update the ASC-MSC seaweed database not later than five days before the expiry of the existing certificate, if certificate validity will be extended.

## Annex B - Objection Procedure

## Guidance Annex B - Objection Procedure

The ASC-MSC methodology offers relevant stakeholders the possibility to provide input at various moments in the ASC-MSC certification process. The auditor must take this information into account when assessing the production unit, including when making the certification decision. Although the ASC-MSC's procedures have been developed to be as fair, inclusive and transparent as possible, different views may arise. In these cases, stakeholders that have raised an issue previously during the assessment (announcement, at the site visit or at PCDR) can make use of the objection procedure as set out below.

- B.1 A stakeholder (including the client) (thereinafter 'the objector') shall contact the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) and cc: ASC-MSC, to file the objection.
- B.2 The Notice of Objection must be submitted no later than 10 working days after the date on which the Final Report and Determination is posted on the ASC-MSC website.
- B.2.1 The Notice of Objection must be submitted to seaweedstandard@msc.org using the Seaweed Notice of Objection Template.
- B.3 The objector must set out clearly and precisely the basis of the objection.
- B.3.1 Only topics that were raised by the stakeholder in the written feedback submitted during the announcement of the audit, at site visit or at PCDR can be the subject of an objection.

## Guidance B.3.1

This is to ensure that stakeholders provide all evidence/information to the team at the outset of the audit or during the subsequent input stages, and not only at the objection stage.

- B.4 The Notice of Objection must:
- a. Identify the alleged errors in the Final Report and Determination.
- b. Explain in sufficient detail why it is claimed that the alleged errors were material to the determination or the fairness of the audit.
- c. Include a summary of the evidence to be relied on in support of the objection.
- d. Include only information that existed in final (not draft) form in the public domain at the time the PCDR was published on the ASC-MSC website.
- i. Information that came into existence after that date cannot be used as a basis for objection.
- B.5 The objector and the CAB shall initially strive to settle the objection in an informal manner, e.g. by the CAB considering the additional information provided, etc.
- B.6 If an agreement is reached informally, the CAB, in consultation with the objector, shall make such changes and revisions to the Final Report and determination as agreed and shall proceed to prepare a Public Certification Report (PCR).
- B.6.1 The PCR shall indicate what has been changed as a result of the informal agreement reached with the objector.
- B.7 If the CAB and objector cannot reach an agreement informally within 10 working days of submitting the objections, the objector may re-submit the Notice of Objection, using this CAB's complaint procedure (which all accredited CABs must have in place as per 7.3.3 and 7.3.4).
- B.8 The CAB shall update the Final Report and determination stating the outcome of the complaint procedure in the PCR.
- B.8.1 The PCR shall indicate what has been changed as a result of the CABs complaint procedure.

B.9 If the objector and the CAB cannot reach an agreement by means of the CAB's complaint procedure, the objector can file a complaint against the CAB with Accreditation Services International (see www.accreditation-services.com/dispute-management).

## Guidance B.8

This procedure is expected to result in a satisfactory solution in most of the cases.

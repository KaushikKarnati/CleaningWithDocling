## BEST AQUACULTURE PRACTICES CERTIFICATION

The following Best Aquaculture Practices standards and guidelines apply to the cage and net pen production in marine waters of both final growout and juvenile production stages of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar; chinook salmon, Onchorynchus tshawytscha; coho salmon, Onchorynchus kisutch ; and rainbow trout, Onchorynchus mykiss. Marine waters are defined as waters with average salinity greater than 25 ppt.

The BAP standards are achievable, science-based and continuously improved global performance standards for the aquaculture supply chain that assure healthful foods produced through environmentally and socially responsible means. They are designed to assist program applicants in performing self-assessments of the environmental and social impacts, and food safety controls of their facilities, and to lead to third-party  certification  of compliance,  thereby eliminating the most significant negative impacts. For further information, please refer to the additional resources listed throughout this document.

BAP standards demand compliance with local regulations as the first step toward certification. However, not all regulations are equally rigorous in all aspects. For this reason, BAP standards set out requirements for documentation and procedures that must be in farm management plans, whether they are prescribed by local regulations or not. By so doing, they seek, where possible, to impose consistency in performance among facilities in different producing regions and to engage the industry as a whole in a process of continuous improvement.

In parallel with the implementation of these standards for salmon farms, the Global Seafood Alliance intends to establish a BAP database to which BAP-certified farms will be required to contribute data anonymously for future GSA-sponsored research in the areas of sediment testing, disease outbreaks and treatments, escapes, accidental killing of wildlife and feed-based carbon: nitrogen ratios, as noted in the individual standards that follow. The data used will be protected  so that its source cannot be identified and shall not be used without the agreement of participants in the BAP program.

In common with ISO usage, these standards use the words 'shall'  to mean compliance is required and 'should'  to mean compliance is recommended. Auditable points are 'shall' statements listed at the end of each standard.

To obtain BAP certification, applicants must be audited by an independent, BAP-approved certification body. To apply for certification, contact:

The audit consists of an opening meeting, a site assessment, the collection of necessary samples, a review of management records and procedures, and a closing meeting. All points in the standards shall be addressed. Any non-conformity  raised during the evaluation is recorded by the auditor in the formal report as:

Critical - When there is a failure to comply with a critical food safety or legal issue, or a risk to the integrity of the program, the auditor  immediately  informs  the  certification body,  which  then  informs  the  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  office.  Pending clarifications, failure to certify or immediate temporary suspension can ensue.

Major - When there is a substantial failure to meet the requirements of a standard but no food safety risk or immediate risk to the integrity of the program, the auditor notifies the certification body and records this in the report. Verification of the implementation of corrective actions shall be submitted  to the certification body within 28 days of the evaluation. (Major non-conformities  typically reflect issues with general policies).

Minor - When full compliance with the intent of standards has not been demonstrated,  the auditor notifies the certification  body and records this in the report. Verification of the implementation of corrective actions shall be submitted  to the certification body within 28 days of the evaluation. (Minor non-conformities  typically reflect general housekeeping issues.)

BAP standards are developed by committees of technical experts following a process aligned to the FAO Technical Guidelines on Aquaculture Certification.

## Salmon Farms

## 1. Community

## Property Rights and Regulatory Compliance

Farms  shall  comply  with  local  and  national  laws  and environmental regulations, and provide current documentation that demonstrates legal rights for land use, water use, construction, operation and waste disposal.

## Reasons for Standard

Regulations are needed to assure that farms provide pertinent information  to  governments  and  pay  fees to  support  relevant programs.  The BAP program  requires compliance  with  applicable  business-related  laws  and  environmental,  social  and food  safety regulations, including  those concerning  protection of sensitive habitats, effluents, operation of landfills and predator control,  because it recognizes that  not  all regulations are uniformly enforced.

Some salmon farms and  their support  facilities  may  be  sited in water bodies  or on land to which  farm owners do not have legal rights. These areas may be used by coastal communities for  fishing,  recreation,  tourism  and  other  uses.  Unauthorized installation of farms can interfere with  the use of resources by local communities.

## Implementation

Regulations regarding the operation and resource use of farms vary  significantly  from  place  to  place.  Among  other  requirements, such laws can call for:

- •  business licenses
- •  aquaculture licenses
- •  land deeds, leases or concession agreements
- •  land use taxes
- •  construction permits
- •  water use permits or leases

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

- •  protection of sensitive habitats
- •  therapeutics use
- •  predator control permits
- •  protection of the rights of native peoples
- ·  environmental impact assessments or reporting on fish health
- ·  compliance with zoning or area management programs, where these are in place.

BAP auditors  cannot know  all laws and regulations that  apply to  salmon farming  in all nations.  Participating  farms have the responsibility  to  obtain  all necessary documentation  for siting, constructing and  operating  their  facilities,  and  make  these available to auditors.

Assistance in determining these necessary permits and licenses can  be  sought  from  governmental  agencies responsible for agriculture, environmental protection, fisheries, aquaculture, water management and transportation,  as well as local aquaculture  associations.  Auditors  shall also become  familiar with the legal requirements within the areas they service.

The BAP  program  imposes  repeated  audits  on  participating facilities. It augments existing regulations that may require aquaculture facilities to perform environmental impact assessments before beginning construction  and to  comply  with  regulations during operation.

During the BAP site inspection,  the representative of the farm shall  present  all  necessary  documents,  including  documents relating to local agreements such as Area Management Agreements,  to  the  auditor.  Farms must  be  in  compliance  with  the requirements  stipulated  by  the  documents.  In  cases  where governmental agencies have waived  one or  more  permits,  or the need for  compliance  with  existing permits,  proof  of  these waivers shall be available.

## Standards

- 1.1: Current documents shall be available to prove legal land and water use by the applicant.
- 1.2: Current documents shall be available to prove all business and operating licenses have been acquired.
- 1.3: Current documents shall be available to prove compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations for construction and operation.
- 1.4: Where applicable, current documents shall be available to prove compliance with Area Management Agreements or other local agreements to which the farm has committed. (See also Standard 2.7.)
- 1.5: Where applicable, current documents shall be available to prove compliance with laws protecting the resources of indigenous peoples and/or independent agreements the applicant may have made with them.
- 1.6: Where applicable, current documents shall be available to show compliance with the farm's own industry codes of practice.

## Salmon Farms

## 2. Community

## Community Relations

Farms shall strive for good community relations, conduct their  businesses responsibly and  be  responsive to  those affected by their operations.

## Reasons for Standard

Some salmon farms may restrict access by local people to areas used  for  fishing  or  recreation.  Farmers  should  find  ways  to accommodate these uses, if possible.

## Implementation

Participants in the BAP program shall be good  neighbors and seek to  cooperate  with  other  rightful  users of  land  and  water to earn  community  acceptance. Farm  management  should communicate  regularly  with  local  leaders  and  respond  helpfully to public requests for information.

Farms  shall  post  signs  that  identify  possible  safety  hazards and should provide  barriers to  entry by  unauthorized persons where  this  is  legal  and  practical.   However,  farm  management  should  try  to  accommodate  traditional  uses  of  natural resources by cooperating with established local interests.

During   facility   inspection,   the   auditor   may   verify   compliance with  these standards  through  examination of  maps  that define public  and private zones and concession areas, on-site inspection of fences and other barriers, and interviews with local people and farm workers selected by the auditor.

## Area Management Agreements

The BAP program strongly supports  the concept  of Area Management Agreements (AMAs) among farms to provide a means for  communication  with  the  local  community  and  the  coordination  of  production and  environmental  management  within defined hydrographic areas. Where AMAs already exist, BAPcertified  farms  shall  participate  in  such  AMAs  and  be  able  to demonstrate compliance with the procedures they define.

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

Boundaries  for  AMAs  are  defined  in  different  jurisdictions  by distance  or  hydrographical  characteristics   (tidal  excursion), with  work  ongoing  to  improve  precision.  It  is  probable  that definitions will evolve over time as better tidal models become available and more is learned about the mechanisms of effective farm separation. Therefore, the BAP program does not yet prescribe a single approach to defining management areas, only compliance with existing management area rules in coun- tries where these are established.

The  BAP  program  also  encourages  the  creation  of  AMAs where  they  do  not  exist  and  their  improvement  when  their boundaries  are  not  based  on  hydrographic characteristics. However,   because   the   ability   to   coordinate   management among  farms  is  not  under  the  control  of  a single BAP applicant, the creation of, and/or setting of boundaries for an AMA, is not yet a requirement for initial BAP certification.

Nonetheless,  applicants must  demonstrate  their  concerted effort  to  cooperate  with  other relevant parties, including  regulatory agencies, to define or improve a management area and to coordinate  management activities among farms within it. Such efforts can include, for example, mapping of the hydro- graphic zone of influence of the BAP applicant farm and sub- mission of this data to the other relevant parties.

Further, BAP applicants  in this position  must project  a timeline for  implementation  of  an AMA and  report  on  progress  during the BAP audit. If the timeline has not been met, the farm must provide  documentary  evidence  to  show  why  the  failure  was beyond its control.

Certified farms not within an AMA must also cooperate with other neighboring  BAP-certified  farms  and  work  together  as if part of an AMA to coordinate activities whenever AMAs are required by  these  standards.  As  a  general  rule,  other  certified  farms within an area  twice the regulatory minimum separation distance to an upper limit  of a 5-kilometer  radius of the applicant shall be considered neighboring.

## Standards

- 2.1: The applicant shall accommodate local inhabitants by not blocking access to fishing areas and other public resources. Where access is not direct, the applicant shall provide signage and a written access plan demonstrating  consideration of biosecurity and employee and public safety.
- 2.2: The applicant shall clearly identify farm property lines and post signs that warn the public and staff of potential safety hazards.
- 2.3: The applicant shall demonstrate interaction with the local community to avoid or resolve conflicts through meetings performed annually or more often, committees, correspondence, service projects or other activities.
- 2.4: The applicant shall record, review and respond helpfully to requests for information received from the public, including sharing of non-proprietary farm data, and to reasonable complaints that are specific to the applicant's operation and provide details in writing of the alleged failing.
- 2.5: Where applicable, the applicant shall demonstrate dialogue with local native peoples and a process for conflict resolution with them under the laws governing their rights.
- 2.6: The applicant shall participate in or be working toward participation  in an Area Management Agreement, and shall demonstrate compliance with the terms of such an agreement or a projected timeline for establishment of an agreement.
- 2.7: Where an AMA has not been established, applicants shall nevertheless demonstrate cooperation on matters of stocking, fallowing, fish health and biosecurity with BAP-certified farms within an area twice the regulatory minimum separation distance to an upper limit of a 5-kilometer radius. (See Sections 4 and 10.)

## Salmon Farms

## 3. Community

## Worker Safety and Employee Relations

Farms shall comply with  local and national labor  laws  to assure adequate worker safety, compensation and, where applicable, on-site living conditions.

## Reasons for Standard

Farm work  is  potentially  dangerous  because  of  the  types  of equipment  employed  and  the  nature  of  the  work  in  and  on water. Workers may not fully understand the risks at farms and safety instructions related to them.

Salmon farms may be located  in remote areas, requiring  that staff live on site for periods to provide security and respond to farm emergencies. Conditions  of employment for salmon farm employees or subcontracted workers must reflect these spe- cial demands  in  addition to provision  of  fair  wages  and  other employee benefits.

## Implementation

At a minimum, certified farms shall provide legal wages, a safe working  environment  and  adequate  living  conditions. Farm management must demonstrate that the facility complies  with national  or  local  laws  governing  the  rights  and  conditions  of employment  of  farm  personnel,  including  casual  labor  and work  by  subcontractors.   Efforts  should  be  made  to  exceed the minimum requirements, because certified farms should be progressive and socially responsible.

Laws notwithstanding,  the  farm  shall have a  written  employment policy, verified during the facility audit, that bans forced or bonded  labor and employment of workers under 15 years old outside the existing International Labor  Organization  conventions  and  standards.  Policies  shall  allow  employees  to organize  collective  bargaining  under  the  respective  nations' laws,  and  provide  written  employment  contracts  in  the  predominant language of the employees.

Policies shall enable employees to express grievances to company  representatives  without discrimination or  harassment. Farms shall provide  insurance or  other  means  to  pay  wages to  employees who  cannot  work  because of  injuries sustained at  work  and  for  fair  and  reasonable  severance  payments  to employees who are made redundant.

Staff  shall be  given training  on  the  work  they  are required  to do,  as well as on safety procedures,  with  allowance made as needed for workers whose first language is not the local language. Safety documents shall be available, and workers shall

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

be trained in first aid and be capable of addressing emergency response procedures.

Safety equipment  such as goggles, gloves, hard hats and life jackets shall be provided  when appropriate  and kept  in working order. A plan shall be available for obtaining  prompt  medical assistance for injured or ill workers.

Farms  shall  apply  dive  safety  plans  that  require  adequate training of staff divers and minimize daily dive frequency. Dives shall be conducted  according  to Defense and Civil Institute  of Environmental Medicine  tables  or  equivalent  approved  tables to reduce the risk of decompression illness to minimal levels.

Divers   shall   maintain   procedural   logs   and   maintenance records  for  diving  equipment,  which  shall be  audited  at  least monthly through a documented  internal audit process. Written procedures  and staff  training for dealing with  diving  emergencies such as decompression sickness are also required.

Living quarters, if provided,  shall meet local and national standards  (e.g.,  water-tight  structures,  adequate  space,  heating/ ventilation/cooling),  and  shall  provide  adequate  clean  washing/shower and toilet facilities. Food services, if provided, shall provide  wholesome  meals for  workers  at  prices  that  do  not exceed local standards. Trash and garbage shall not accumulate in living, food preparation or dining areas. (See Section 8.)

For  subcontractors  who  work  on  the  farm,  the  subcontracting companies or individuals shall provide documents to prove they  are legally licensed or  registered  to  work  in  the  relevant jurisdiction.  Records  of  subcontracting   shall  be  maintained, and  individuals  who  work  as  subcontractors more  than  100 hours in any month shall receive the same safety training provided to direct-hire  employees. Individuals or companies contracted  for  diving  work  shall  follow  the  same  procedures  as direct-hire employees.

During  facility inspection, the  auditor  will  evaluate  whether conditions  comply  with  labor laws. The auditor  will also interview  a  random  sample  of  workers  to  obtain  their  opinions about  wages, safety and living  conditions.  Any discrepancies will be investigated.

## 4. Environment

## Implementation

## Sediment and Water Quality

Farms shall be  located  and  operated  in such  a  way  that they  minimize  negative  impacts  on  sediment  quality outside a  defined  sediment impact  zone,  or on water  quality within the general vicinity of the farm.

## Reasons for Standard

Salmon  farms  have  the  potential   to   cause  environmental harm due to  sediment accumulation  under farms. The causes include  settlement  of  feces and uneaten food,  detachment  of fouling  debris  from  nets, or sloughing  of  antifouling  materials. (See Section  8.) Salmon  facilities  can  also  affect  water  quality  near the farm due to  excretion  of metabolic  wastes  by the fish. The occurrence or severity of these effects varies greatly among locations  and regions, and sediment  monitoring  is the most practical means of detecting change.

Water  column  and  benthic  effects  can  be  caused  by  other aspects  of  farm operation,  such as the use of  medicines  and chemicals  to  treat  fish  for  parasites  or  diseases,  careless waste  disposal  or  spills  of  fuel  and  toxic  chemicals.  These matters are addressed in Sections 8 and 10.

## Sediment

Farms are usually located  following  a hydrographic,  biological and  physical  study  of  the  site  to  determine  that  farm  operations will not have significant negative impacts on animal populations that comprise the benthos under or near the farm. Then 'allowable' benthic impacts are  set as  conditions in the operating permits for the farm, which are defined in terms of one or more  of  several  chemical  properties of the  sediments. Sometimes these are then correlated with species density and diversity  determinations,  which  are based  on prior  knowledge of  local  sediment  biology  or  analysis  of  sediment  reference samples collected from the farm location.

Farm   permits   and/or   local   regulations   usually   define   an allowed 'sediment  impact  zone' or 'allowable  zone of effect,' sometimes  also called  the  'footprint  of  deposition,'  and  prescribe  monitoring  protocols to  check  it.  Because  biological sampling   of   sediments   requires   special   expertise   and   is time-consuming  and expensive, chemical sediment properties are usually used  as leading  indicators  of  sediment  condition. Biological  sampling is only required in some jurisdictions  if an indicator trigger point is exceeded.

## Salmon Farms

Chemical  indicators  used  for  this  purpose  include  sulfide, REDOX potential,  total  organic  carbon  or  total  volatile  solids, or visual inspection with documentation  by video. Some methods are better suited to some environments than others.

For  example,  sulfide  determination  works  well  in  silt  or  clay sediments containing  up to 50%  sand, as does determination of  total  organic  carbon.  Above  this  level  of  sand,  an  indicator  such  as  total  organic  carbon  works  better.  On  hard  bottoms  with  over 10%  gravel, visual recording  by  video  is best because  grab  sampling  is  impossible,  and  many  such  sea bottoms are erosional in nature, not depositional.

Since different  methods  or combinations  of  methods  may be required by different jurisdictions,  based on local hydrographic or benthic conditions, no preferred method is specified in these standards, only that whatever method is used shall be undertaken using standard  methods  of sampling and analysis that conform to generally accepted international standards.

Except in situations where sediment monitoring is not required and/or where an allowed sediment impact zone is not defined, provisions  for  which  are  made  below,  all  applicants  for  BAP certification shall:

- ·  Provide documents that describe local standards for benthic impacts under salmon farms.
- ·  Existing farms shall provide at least three years of monitoring data to show that the farms meet or exceed benthic standards required by operating permits at current production levels.
- ·  New farms shall have completed a baseline study, with review by an independent expert, that describes hydrographic and benthic conditions at the farm site, and that in the expert's opinion (given without liability), the farm can meet or exceed the benthic standards required by its operating permits at current or proposed production levels. This opinion shall be verified by reference to sampling results at the next audit.
- ·  Provide documents to show that sediment quality was determined using generally accepted sample collection and analytical methods.
- ·  Collect and store data from which the farm's feedbased carbon and nitrogen discharges can be calculated for possible future submission to the BAP Salmon Database (see Introduction) and which may be used in future GSA-sponsored research. This means recording the carbon and nitrogen content of feed fed, the weight of all fish harvested plus dead fish removed during farming, less the weight of the smolts stocked.

## Regions Where Sediment Monitoring Is Not Required

In  countries or regions  where  sediment  monitoring is not required  as  described  above  and/or  where  an  allowed  sediment  impact  zone  is  not  defined,  applicants  shall  write  and implement a monitoring plan that requires them to:

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

- ·  Nominate an independent individual or company with demonstrated expertise in sediment sampling and analysis to design a sediment sampling and analysis program appropriate to the farm conditions and to conduct sediment monitoring as required below.
- · Chart an allowable sediment impact zone that shall not exceed the total area of the farm plus a boundary zone of 40 meters around it. The footprint may be shifted in any direction to account for normally occurring uneven current patterns, as long as the total area remains the same.
- ·  Monitor the build-up of organic matter and copper, if copper-based  antifoulants are used, on the seabed within this zone by the method deemed best for the type of sediment that exists there. The choice of method shall be justified by prior documentation of the type of sediments over which the farm is located.
- ·  Conduct sediment sampling to coincide with the period of peak feeding during each crop cycle. (Note: Section 10 requires cyclical stocking and harvesting for fish health reasons. Therefore, all BAP-certified farms must operate on a cyclical production  schedule). Samples shall be taken along at least two transects that pass directly through the farm and align with the dominant flow of water at the farm site. One sample with five replicates shall be taken at the edge of the farm and another at the 40-meter boundary.
- ·  Five replicate samples shall also be taken from at least two reference stations within 1 kilometer of the farm that have similar depth and sediment characteristics as occur at the farm and where there is no other salmon production.
- ·  Demonstrate by statistical analysis of the results that there is no organic build-up or increase in the concentration of copper at the boundary of the allowable sediment impact zone by comparison to the reference station, as determined by the monitoring method chosen.
- ·  Collect and store data from which the farm's feedbased carbon and nitrogen discharges can be calculated for possible future submission to the BAP Salmon Database, as required for other farms above.

## Water Quality

Farm operation  effects  on water quality  are usually measured using  internationally  standardized  methods,  but  these  effects are  dependent  on  temporal  and  local  factors,  and  are  often transitory.

Most  farms  measure  dissolved-oxygen levels  frequently  or continuously  to  ensure  the  well-being  of  their  fish,  but  determination  of  metabolites  such  as  phosphates  and  ammonia is  not  considered  necessary  for  BAP  certification  for  a  single farm,  except  where this  is  already required  as a condition  of the farm's operating permits.

However, there may be reasons for concern  about  the cumulative  and  far-field  effects  on  water  quality  of  several  farms in  one area, especially  in  nutrient-poor  areas. In such  cases, coordinated  nutrient  monitoring  shall  be  included  within  the specifications of an Area Management Agreement (Section 2).

## Salmon Farms

## BAP Database

There is considerable  interest in trying  to  develop  one widely accepted, globally applicable protocol for monitoring the impacts  on  sediments  under  marine  fish  farms.  Due  to  differences  in  biological  community  composition, hydrography, water  circulation  and  sediment  type,  however,  this  is  difficult. Nonetheless,  it  is  thought  that  analysis of  monitoring  results from BAP-certified farms might offer insight on how this might be done.

For  this  reason,  farms  will  in  the  future  be  asked  to  submit sediment-monitoring   data  to  the  BAP  database  (see  Introduction)  for  use  in  future  GSA-sponsored  research  to  evaluate the desirability  of  such a protocol.  Development of mechanisms  for  establishing  the  confidentiality  and  anonymity  of the sources of such data shall precede implementation of this requirement  and  be  undertaken  in  cooperation  with  existing BAP-certified farms.

## 5. Environment

## Fishmeal and Fish Oil Conservation

Farms shall use feeds  and  feed  ingredients produced  by responsible methods, accurately monitor feed  inputs and minimize the use of fishmeal and fish oil derived from wild fisheries.

## Reasons for Standard

The majority of feeds manufactured for use in aquaculture contain fishmeal and fish oil as protein and lipid  sources. Although fishmeal and fish oil are renewable resources derived  primarily from populations  of small fish that are not generally utilized for direct  human consumption,  there are limits  to  the  amounts  of these products the world's oceans can supply.

The BAP program  therefore supports  the  use of  feed  ingredients  derived  from  alternative sources, as well as fishmeal and fish oil produced  from fish processing and fishery by-products. Fishery-based  ingredients   from   wild   sources   should   come from  responsibly  managed fisheries and  shall comply  with  the requirements  of  standard  3  of  the  BAP  feed  mill  certification standards.

In addition,  by  improving  the efficiency  with  which  feed is converted into fish biomass, farmers can lessen the amount of fishmeal and fish oil used. More efficient feed conversion also has a direct  beneficial impact  on water quality and limits the release of excess nutrients to the environment.

## Implementation

Aquaculture  feeds  are  typically  manufactured  at  commercial facilities and delivered to  farms. Farmers shall obtain feed from suppliers  that  provide  reliable information  on the crude  protein and fishmeal and fish oil content in the feeds. In addition, all BAPcertified farms shall obtain documents from their feed suppliers that list the type and inclusion rate of all non-marine ingredients used  at  inclusion  rates  over  10%. Farmers  shall  record  the characteristics  of all feeds used, the total amounts of each feed used each year and the total annual fish production.

To  promote  the  responsible  sourcing  of  marine  ingredients, the applicant shall obtain feed from a BAP-certified feed mill or a feed mill that  declares and documents  compliance  with BAP feed  mill  standards 3.1  and  3.3.  These  standards address sourcing policies on marine ingredients, covering traceability for species and origin, and the exclusion of any species designated on the IUCN Redlist as endangered or critically endangered.

The BAP feed mill standards require that after June 2015, for fishmeal and fish oil derived from reduction fisheries, at least 50%  (calculation  based  on  mass  balance)  shall  come  from sources  that  are  either  certified  by  the  Marine  Stewardship Council  (MSC) or  to  the  International  Fishmeal and  Fish  Oil Organization Responsible Supply standards (IFFO RS).

Alternatively,  where  MSC-  or  IFFO  RS-certified  fishmeal  and fish  oil  are  not  produced  nationally,  the  above  minimum

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

percentage can comprise material from active approved improvers  programs  as  verified  by  IFFO  (http://www.iffo.net/ node/493), the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (http://fisheryimprovementprojects.org/view-fips/)  or  World  Wildlife  Fund (https://sites.google.com/site/fisheryimprovementprojects/ home). This  50%  target  will  be  periodically  reassessed  with the ultimate goal that all fishmeal and fish oil are derived from certified sources.

## 'Fish In:Fish Out' Ratio

The so-called 'fish in:fish out' ratio, the calculation of which is explained below,  is one of several means of measuring the ecological  efficiency  of  an  aquaculture  system.  It  compares the amount of fish consumed by the system (usually in the form of fishmeal and fish oil) with the amount of fish produced.

BAP applicants  shall estimate this ratio for each year class of fish once it has all been harvested. This is done by estimating the equivalent amount of whole fish (wet weight) eaten in the form  of  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  by  each  year  class  of  fish  and dividing it by the weight of whole fish harvested from the year class. This is further explained in Equations 1 and 2 below.

Estimation of the equivalent amount of whole fish in the feed fed shall be made based on data provided  by the feed sup- plier on  the  transformation  yields  to  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  for the industrial  fish  used.  In  the  absence  of  such  information, the equivalent amount of whole fish shall be calculated by assuming transformation rates of 22.5% and 5.0% for marine protein and marine oil, respectively.

BAP-certified  salmon  producers  shall  obtain  fish  in:fish  out ratios of 1.5 or less.

## Fish In:Fish Out Calculation

First,  farmers must  estimate  the feed-conversion  ratio (FCR), the  amount  of  feed  needed  to  produce  a  unit  weight  of  the culture species. Farms shall calculate and record  the FCR for each year class using the following  equation,  then apply  that value in Equation 2 for the fish in:fish out ratio:

## Equation 1

Feed-conversion ratio (year class) = Total annual feed use (mt) ÷ [Total harvested fish weight - weight of smolts (mt)]

## Equation 2

Fish in:fish out ratio = Feed fish inclusion factor of feed (from manufacturer) x Feed-conversion ratio

Where feed fish inclusion factor = [Level of fishmeal in diet (%) + Level of fish oil in diet (%)] ÷ [Yield of fishmeal from wild fish (%) + Yield of fish oil from wild fish (%)]

The inclusion  levels in  Equation  2  shall  include  any  meal  or oil  derived  from  wild-caught  fish,  squid,  krill,  mollusks  or  any other  wild  marine animals. However,  they  shall exclude  meal or  oil  derived  from  fishery  by-products  such  as  trimmings, offal  and  squid  liver  powder,   and  aquaculture  by-products such as shrimp head meal.

## Salmon Farms

To  illustrate  the  fish  in:fish  out  (FIFO) calculation,  consider  a salmon feed that  contains  12.0%  fish  oil  and  20.0%  fishmeal, and  assume a  yield  of  fishmeal  from  wild  fish  of  22.5%  and yield of fish oil from wild fish of 5.0%.

Feed fish inclusion factor = (12.0 + 20.0) ÷ (22.5 + 5.0) = 1.16

Thus, for an FCR of 1.2, FIFO = 1.16 x 1.2 = 1.40.

- 5.1: The applicant shall source feed from a BAP-certified feed mill or a feed mill that declares and documents compliance with the BAP feed mill standards criteria for fishmeal and fish oil conservation.
- 5.2: Documents from feed suppliers shall be available that assure the traceability to source of marine protein and lipid ingredients present in feed at levels of 1% and non-marine ingredients at levels of 10% or greater.
- 5.3: The facility shall record the characteristics of all feeds used, and for each year class, shall record the total amounts of each feed used and the total fish production.
- 5.4: The facility shall calculate and record a feed-conversion ratio for each year class.
- 5.5: The facility shall calculate and achieve a final fish in:fish out ratio of 1.5 or less for each year class harvested.

## 6. Environment

shall have three parts and include the following elements:

## Control of Escapes

Salmon  farms  shall  take  all  practical  steps  to  prevent escapes and minimize possible adverse effects on aquatic wildlife if escapes occur.

## Reasons for Standard

Salmon  can  escape  from  farms  under  a  number  of  circumstances.  Typically, escapes occur  when holes develop  in nets due  to  wear  and  tear,  collisions  with  boats,  human  error  or attack by  large  predators. Damage  can  also  occur  during severe weather or  from  vandalism or  robbery,  when nets  are damaged or cut, leading to substantial losses. Escapes sometimes happen when fish are removed from the water for grading or harvesting, or if net meshes are too  large for the smallest fish stocked in the cages.

Escapees can affect wild salmon and other wild fish by competing with them for food and/or habitat, or by transmission of disease. When the escaped fish are the same species as wild salmon in the area, they can interbreed and cause changes in genetic population profile.

## Implementation

## Fish Containment Plan

Applicants  shall  have  a  written  Fish  Containment  Plan  that includes  provisions  stipulated  in  the  farm's  operating  permits as well as the provisions below, if not so stipulated.  The plan

- •   Escape prevention
- •   Dealing with known or suspected escapes
- •   Inventory accounting procedures.

## Escape Prevention

- ·  A classification of the farm site based on expected wave heights and currents based on local estimates of 10- and 50-year maximum wind speeds and durations using the method proposed in NS9415 or equivalent.
- ·  A report from a qualified marine engineer or accredited third party that confirms the farm structure design and installation  are appropriate,  given the 10-  and 50-year site conditions estimated in the site classification.
- ·  Documents that show the farm's moorings were installed according to the manufacturer's and/or marine engineer's specifications.
- ·  A site risk analysis updated at least annually that identifies the potential and actual causes of fish escapes, determines their relative likelihood of occurrence or recurrence at the farm site, and identifies critical control points for effective escape risk monitoring, escape risk reduction and response to escapes by farm staff.
- ·  Procedures based on the risk analysis that include management protocols and actions designed to monitor escape risks, reduce them when identified and respond to escape events in a timely and effective manner. The efficacy of these measures shall be verified and documented through the year.
- ·  Procedures that require the main surface components of the system to be inspected by qualified inspectors

## Salmon Farms

at least annually and repaired or replaced as needed. The sub-surface components must be inspected and replaced, as needed, at least every two years or between each crop cycle, whichever is shorter. Equipment shall be replaced as needed.

- ·  Net inventory management procedures that track the ages of all nets on the farm or in storage, and provide strength tests on all nets between crops or every two years, whichever period is shorter. Nets shall be retired when their strength is below levels specified in local regulations or, where there are none, below the manufacturer's or supplier's recommendations.
- ·  Cage inspection procedures that ensure all operational nets are surface checked for holes at least weekly and checked sub-surface at least every four weeks. Nets and cage superstructure shall be checked for holes and other indications of structural damage after risk events such as storms or big tides.
- ·  Predator deterrence procedures that minimize the risk that predators can make holes in nets. (See Section 7).
- ·  Boat equipment that includes guards on propellers and staff training procedures that minimize the risk of contact between boats and farm nets. (See Section 3.)
- ·  Procedures and equipment consistent with local Coast Guard rules to warn non-farm marine traffic of the farm's presence.
- •  Procedures for handling live fish to prevent 'spillage.'
- ·  A training program for all staff, which shall be part of their initial training, on all procedures in the Fish Health Containment Plan.

## Known and Suspected Escapes

- ·  BAP applicants shall maintain equipment for attempted recapture and have written procedures for its use in situations where it might work. The procedures must enable rapid response, subject to legal constraints on the types of equipment that can be used.
- ·  If an escape is known or suspected to have occurred, the cause shall be investigated immediately, and steps shall be taken to correct  it. These actions shall be documented in farm records.
- ·  If, after investigation, there are grounds for believing that an escape occurred, the fish remaining in the cage or cages shall be counted, if and/or when water and welfare indicators (Section 9) indicate this can be done without causing excessive distress to the fish, and any loss of inventory shall be recorded.
- · BAP certification shall be suspended if three or more escapes of more than 500 fish from individual cages are documented  over two consecutive production  cycles, or if such escapes cumulatively exceed 5,000 fish.
- ·  BAP certification shall also be suspended if there is a single escape of more than 5,000 fish at any time. The escape shall be reported immediately to the regulator with BAP and the certifying body notified accordingly.
- ·  In both cases, reinstatement of BAP certification following such escapes shall be subject to an independent engineering and operational review and risk assessment to determine the cause or causes of the escape(s), and recommend corrective action where

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

these are matters the applicant can reasonably be expected to control. Reinstatement shall also be subject to proof presented by the applicant that corrective action has been taken.

- ·  Details of known escapes shall be collected for possible future entry to the BAP Salmon Database (see Introduction) and shared with other farms in an AMA, where such an agreement is in place, and with BAP-certified farms in the area. (See Section 2.)
- ·  Known escapes shall also be reported to the regulator, proof of which shall be maintained in farm records

## Inventory Accounting Procedures

- ·  A certificate signed by an authorized hatchery representative shall accompany all shipments of juvenile fish (smolts) received that states how many fish are in the shipment and the estimated margin of error in the count. The margin of error shall be verifiable by reference to documented hatchery procedures and records.
- ·  After a year class of smolts is fully stocked, the number shall be recorded, and a projection shall be prepared of the number of fish expected to be harvested from it, based on the number of smolts received and taking into account possible error in the hatchery count, as well as other projected losses during the growth cycle.
- ·  The above projection shall then be compared with the actual number harvested when harvesting of a year class is complete. Any variance shall be explained by reference to farm records of known losses. Variances greater than ± 3% that cannot be explained shall prompt  a secondary audit investigation at the applicant's expense to determine the cause, and, if a satisfactory explanation is not found, shall result in loss of BAP certification.

## Limiting Impacts of Escapes

Farms  shall  not  be  located  in  habitat  areas  officially  designated as 'critical'  or  'sensitive'  (or equivalent regional terminology) with  respect  to  wild  salmon unless it  can be  demonstrated that the situation was considered specifically by regulators  in  granting  operating  permits  and  approvals,  and that  such consideration  was backed  by  an independent  environmental analysis.

For  the  purposes  of  these  BAP  guidelines,  'wild'   salmonids are defined as those naturally spawning salmonid populations that  have  had  little  or  no  direct  stocking  of  hatchery-reared fish for at least two generations.

## Non-native Species

Introductions  of  species  of  salmon  to  countries  where  such species  are either  not  native  or  not  already  farmed  shall  be subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  2005  ICES Code  of  Practice on the Introductions  and Transfers of Marine Organisms.

## Genetically Modified Salmon

Cage farms shall not  stock  transgenic  fish, which  are defined as fish  that  have been genetically modified  by  artificial  transfer  of  genetic  material  from  a different  species.  Sex-reversed salmon and their offspring,  and organisms created by hybridization and polyploidy are not transgenic salmon.

## Salmon Farms

## Technical Notes

Techniques  to  produce  sterile  salmon  that  cannot  interbreed with  local  wild  salmon if  they escape are the  subject  of  current research. This will be kept under review by the BAP program and its advisors, and may be a future requirement for certification.

Methods  for  marking  fish  so  that  farmed  fish  caught  in  the wild can be traced to their source are feasible, but difficult to use on  a  large scale.  Nonetheless,  such  marking  is  a  desir- able goal and thus will also be kept under review as a possible future requirement for BAP certification.

- 6.7: The farm shall not be located within an area officially designated as 'critical' or 'sensitive' habitat (or equivalent terminology) with respect to wild salmon unless site-specific, valid, official documentation authorizing an exemption, supported by an environmental impact analysis, can be provided.
- 6.8: The applicant shall provide documents that prove the species of salmon farmed is approved for farming in that country and that the stocked fish are not transgenic. Where the species farmed is not native or not already farmed, further documents shall be provided to demonstrate that approval for farming is based on the 2005 ICES Code of Practice on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms.

## Salmon Farms

## 7. Environment

## Predator and Wildlife Interactions

Farms shall manage physical interactions with wildlife and not reduce the biodiversity of ecosystems.

## Reasons for Standard

Salmon  farms  are located  along  mostly  undeveloped  coastlines, where abundant marine wildlife is common. Wildlife species  may interact  with  salmon  farms  because they  are intimidated  by  the  farms'  presence  or  because  they  are attracted to farms as habitat, somewhere to perch or hide, or a place to find food.

For  this  section,  these  interactions  are  defined  as  'physical interactions,' distinguished  from  the  'biological interactions' with wild salmon addressed in Sections 6 and 10. Many physical interactions with  wildlife  are harmless, but  in some cases, they  can  injure  wildlife  through  entanglement  and  drowning, or  damage  farm  equipment.  Wildlife  in  areas  designated  as 'critical'   or  'sensitive'  habitat  can  be  particularly  vulnerable to  adverse  interactions,  and  salmon  farms  may  be  required to  adopt  special precautions  if they are permitted  to locate  in such an area.

Wildlife  species  that  interact  with  salmon  farms  include  but are not limited to diving birds that attack small fish through net meshes, predatory birds that take fish from the surface and small marine mammals such as otters  that enter cages and kill fish. Large marine mammals may attack fish from the outside and damage nets. Certain fish species may chew on nets and create holes.

## Implementation

Applicants  shall have a written  Wildlife Interaction  Plan (WIP) that includes provisions stipulated in local laws and the farms' operating permits, as well as the requirements itemized below, if  not  so  stipulated.  The WIP shall describe  area wildlife  and include  copies  of  important, relevant  reference  documents, where these exist. It shall also highlight specific points of concern or ecological  sensitivity,  and itemize policies  and procedures the farm  will  follow  to  accomplish  the  goal  of  avoiding harm  to  wildlife  while  protecting  farmed  fish  and  farm  infrastructure.

The  BAP  program strongly encourages farms to employ humane,  non-lethal  measures  for  predator  exclusion  and/or control,  even when  lethal  methods  are permitted.  Farms shall record all predator mortalities (species and numbers). All marine mammals,  seabirds  and  species  listed  as  'critically endangered'  or 'endangered'  on the International Union for  Conservation of Nature Red List or protected  by local or national laws shall  not  be  subject  to  control  by  any means except  physical exclusion,  unless  human  safety  is  at  risk  or  an  independent environmental  audit  provides  justification  for  such  control,  and specific written permission for an alternative means of control has been granted by the regulator with jurisdiction.

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

Although there are cultural and legal differences among countries regarding the protection  of wildlife, particularly Pinnipeds, BAP-certified  salmon  farms  must  do  all  they  reasonably  can to not harm wildlife, irrespective of local customs.

The WIP shall include but is not limited to:

- ·  A list of relevant local laws and specific conditions of the farm's operating permits that apply to wildlife man- agement and protection.
- ·  A list of local species classified as endangered or threatened under local laws and/or listed as 'critically endangered' or 'endangered'  on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2022).
- ·  Proactive searching for information and surveys on endangered or threatened (ETP) species in the vicinity of the farm.
- ·  T raining for farm staff in recognizing endangered, threatened and protected  species they may see from the farm and a system for recording and reporting such observations to farm management and to members of the public who have expressed interest.
- ·  A map that identifies officially designated 'critical' and/or 'sensitive'  marine and coastal habitat in the region. If the farm is in an area so designated, a list of the classified or endangered sedentary species within a 2-kilometer radius of the farm and of mobile coastal species within the region, updated where necessary to show wildlife established after the farm was started, shall also be included.
- ·  Independent expert risk assessment of the farm's possible interactions with the wildlife in the critical or sensitive habitat, if this has not been considered by regulators in granting the farm's license(s).
- ·  Procedures to deal with risks identified in the expert assessment.
- ·  Designation of one staff member to carry out lethal control measures, if needed, and for training of that individual in humane slaughter methods.
- ·  Description of the farm's passive measures to deter the entry into cages of predatory birds or small mammals.
- ·  Description of the farm's passive measures to protect cages from underwater attack by marine mammals.
- ·  Procedures for the regular inspection of cages to check and report the integrity of the passive measures.
- ·  Documentation to show that acoustic harassment devices used are approved by regulators through a review of environmental impacts with specific refer- ence to endangered, protected,  threatened or ceta- cean species in the area. Such devices shall not be deployed if the review shows they can adversely affect these species.
- ·  Reporting procedures in the event that control measures cause the accidental death of wildlife and for proposed action to prevent the same from happening again. Reports of these instances may be required for submission to the BAP Salmon Database for future use in GSA-sponsored research. (See Introduction.)
- ·  Procedures that state lethal methods shall only be used after all non-lethal methods are attempted  and must be legally approved.
- ·  Procedures that make it clear deliberate lethal controls on species classified as endangered or threatened are not to be used except under exceptional circum-

## Salmon Farms

stances, such as risk to human life, and then, if not an emergency, only after specific written authorization is obtained from regulators.

- ·  Procedures for regulatory authorization, implementation and reporting of lethal control measures when these are deemed necessary.

## Standards

- 7.1: If the farm operates in a jurisdiction with government regulations related to interactions with wildlife and predator control, the applicant shall comply with the regulations and provide proof of so doing.
- 7.2. Local rules notwithstanding,  the applicant shall demonstrate that the farm meets the BAP procedural, performance, documentation and reporting requirements for a written Wildlife Interaction Plan, as described in the implementation requirements above, which shall include a list of local species of concern, expert wildlife interaction risk assessment, procedures to respond to risks and a description of the farm's passive deterrence measures and inspection procedures.
- 7.3: The applicant shall provide site maps or other current documentation that show the farm is not within geographic areas officially designated 'critical' or 'sensitive' habitat (or equivalent). If such documentation is not available, the applicant shall provide proof of regulatory authorization of the farm site and operations, as well as a risk assessment of farm/wildlife interactions and related procedures.
- 7.4: Farm employees shall be familiar with the provisions of the WIP and trained in aspects of it that they may be called upon to implement.
- 7.5: The applicant shall actively favor passive and/or non-lethal methods of predator control.

- 7.6: If lethal control is necessary and justified, the applicant shall designate a member of staff to take the action, provide training as needed in humane slaughter methods and only use methods that are legally approved.
- 7.7: The applicant shall record, and report when required, the species and numbers of all avian, mammalian and reptilian predator mortalities, including accidental mortalities.
- 7.8: The applicant may only use acoustic harassment devices to control predators if independent expert opinion verifies that their use will not harm endangered, protected or threatened species or any cetaceans, and if they are legally approved and/or permitted for use.
- 7.9: The frequency of incidences of active deterrence in which wildlife is affected shall be reduced over time unless extenuating circumstances can be demonstrated.

## 8. Environment

## Storage and Disposal of Farm Supplies

Spills or careless disposal of petroleum products  and chemicals can affect aquatic organisms and other wildlife in the immediate vicinity, and result in water pollution over a wider area.

Feed,  fuel,  lubricants and  chemicals  shall be  stored  and disposed  of  in  a  safe  and  responsible  manner.  Paper and  plastic  refuse  shall be  disposed of  in a  sanitary and responsible way.

## Reasons for Standard

Modern salmon farming uses feed that is susceptible  to spoilage and infestation  by  vermin  and  pests  unless stored  properly.  Farms  use  fuel,  oil  and  grease  to  power  and  lubricate boats,  pumps,  aerators and  other  mechanical devices.  Some farms may use parasiticides  and antifoulants.  Other products employed include paints, disinfectants and detergents.

Fuels and other chemicals are highly flammable and/or explosive,  and  parasiticides  and  antifoulants  are  toxic.  They shall therefore be considered potential hazards to workers.

Farms  generate  waste  that  can  cause  pollution,  odors  and human health hazards when not disposed of properly.  Human food  scraps,  out-of-date feed  and  other  organic  waste  can attract scavengers.

Empty plastic  bags and other containers  used for feed, fertilizer and other  materials do  not  decompose  quickly.  They can  be  a hazard to animals that become entangled in them or ingest them.

These wastes may be stored prior  to  disposal  at a land base from  which  the  farm  is  supplied,  as  well  as  transported  on boats  and  barges  to  and  from  the  farm.  Safe,  responsible transport,  storage,  handling  and  disposal  of  these  materials are necessary at all times.

Procedures  for  the  collection  and  sanitary  disposal  of  dead fish recovered from the net pens are described under biosecurity procedures in Section 10.

## Salmon Farms

## Implementation

Applicants  shall have a written  Materials Storage, Handling and Waste Disposal Plan (MSHWDP) that includes provisions stipulated in local laws and the farms'  operating  permits,  as well as the following requirements, if not so stipulated:

- ·  Procedures for the sanitary storage and handling of feed and its protection from vermin.
- ·  A current inventory of all hazardous materials used and wastes stored and/or disposed of by the farm.
- ·  Availability of material safety data sheets on site for all hazardous materials in the inventory.
- ·  Procedures for the storage, transport, handling, labeling and use of fuel, oil, chemicals and other potentially toxic materials used on the farm that limit the risk of accidental spills and release into the environment. Secondary containment shall be provided for individual or multiple fuel storage tanks. The containment volume shall be equivalent to the total stored volume plus 10%.
- ·  Refueling, maintenance and record-keeping procedures for all equipment that uses oil or fuel in order to prevent leaks or spills and ensure that used oil is sent to an approved handling facility.
- ·  Procedures for the collection, storage and disposal of trash, garbage, refuse and other waste materials.
- ·  Procedures and the necessary materials and equipment for emergency containment and cleanup of spilled materials.
- ·  Procedures for washing nets treated with copper or other toxicant-based  antifouling materials. Nets treated with antifoulant that is deemed toxic, such as cooper, shall be cleaned out of the water at a licensed off-farm

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

net-cleaning establishment, or on the farm if equipment and procedures are in place to treat the wash water and collect the solid waste before disposal. In all cases, methods of collection and treatment shall comply with national or regional regulations governing the disposal of toxic wastes.

- ·  Procedures for the sanitary storage and disposal of human waste (black water).
- •  Procedures for recycling waste, where this is feasible.
- ·  Procedures for the safe disposal of materials deemed surplus or out of date, including medicated feed.
- ·  A written waste reduction plan for measuring and recording waste volumes and how such volumes will be reduced by recycling or other means over time.
- ·  The waste reduction plan shall include a program to test alternatives to the use of toxicant-based  antifoulant paints on farm nets with the goal of reducing release of toxicants to the environment, especially toxicant particles that can accumulate in marine sediments.

Note: The use of toxicant-based  antifoulants will not be allowed at  BAP-certified  farms  once  the  utility  of  alternatives  is  fully established.  This  will  be  a  priority consideration  at  the  next review of these standards.

## 9. Animal Health and Welfare

## Health and Welfare

Producers shall demonstrate  that  all operations on farms that  involve fish, including 'cleaner fish' if used, are  conducted  with  animal  welfare  in  mind.  Employees shall be trained  to  provide  appropriate  levels  of  husbandry  and care.

## Reasons for Standard

Fish  can  experience  distress  from  various  causes,  including poor  health,  morphological   deformities,  transport,  handling and  water  quality  degradation,  or  at  harvest.  However,  such distress can be limited and production  efficiency enhanced by applying  good  husbandry  techniques  to  avoid  culture  conditions that may cause needless harm to the fish.

When farmed fish are exposed to continuously poor condi- tions, their feed consumption and growth rates can decline. Distressed  animals  are  also  less  resistant  to  diseases,  and mortality usually increases.

Various stages and circumstances  in the salmon-farming  process can cause distress to fish. These include the transport of smolts  from  hatcheries  and  handling  during  sampling,  grading  and  counting,  harvesting,  holding  before  slaughter  and slaughtering.  Poor  water  quality  conditions, such  as  those associated with low levels  of dissolved oxygen,  plankton blooms in surrounding waters or extreme water temperatures or temperature fluctuations, can cause fish to be distressed, both on the farm and in the wild.

Infectious diseases and parasite infestations,  as well as treatments for them, affect fish. So, also, do rearing densities too high  for the  culture conditions and  sudden  environmental changes, such as bright  lights,  noise, net billowing  and predator attacks.

## Implementation

Fish should  always be  treated  with  care. The following  good aquatic   animal   husbandry   practices   should   therefore   be applied and shall be overseen by a fish health professional as part of the Fish Health Management Plan (Section 10).

Farms shall  provide  facilities  for  holding  and  rearing  fish  that allow  them  to  thrive.  High-quality  feed  should  be  offered  at regular intervals, although fasting periods  are often needed to enable harvesting in hygienic conditions.

Farm  staff  shall  regularly  inspect  the  culture  facility,  noting water  quality  as  well  as  the  appearance  and  behavior  of  the fish,  and  report  observations  to  management  daily.  Trained personnel shall follow  up  on reports  of  behavioral distress  to determine the causes of problems and resolve them.

Behavioral  indicators of ill health  include near-the-surface swimming,   segregation   or   deviation   from   normal   schooling patterns,  and weak feeding motivation.  Fish may display

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

respiratory  distress,  such  as rapidly  pumping  or  permanently open  opercula. Change  in  color, especially darkening, is another possible sign of several diseases, as well as distress.

Morphological  abnormalities such as snout injuries, jaw deformities, cutaneous ulcers and poor fin condition or scale loss can also indicate poor rearing conditions.  However, these physical signs  are lagging  indicators  that  can  often  be  pre- dicted  by observing behavioral changes and taking appropriate preemptive action. When  morphological abnormalities  are present, their causes should be determined and corrected.

Dead fish should be regularly removed from cages and pens, and  disposed  of  properly.  Fish  that  are  obviously  impaired should  be  removed  from  their  cages  and  euthanized  in  a humane fashion.

The farm shall have a written Water Quality Management Plan that includes:

- ·  Frequent or continuous monitoring of dissolvedoxygen concentration and at least daily monitoring of water temperature and salinity.
- ·  Monitoring for other aspects of water quality that may affect fish in the vicinity of the farm, including seasonal occurrences such as phytoplankton blooms.
- ·  Training of staff on measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen and, where relevant, concentrations of harmful phytoplankton.
- · A list of practical mitigation measures that can be used in the event of water quality problems, as well as available equipment and trained staff to deploy them rapidly.
- ·  Provision for equipment to maintain and monitor dissolved-oxygen levels at 80 to 100 percent of saturation during live fish transport.

When fish are crowded for management purposes, the time shall be limited to one hour. Stocking  densities shall be mod- erate and take into account  local and temporal factors,  such as fish size, water temperature, dissolved-oxygen  levels and  the hydrographic patterns of the farm.

Average farm  stocking  density  shall  not  normally  exceed  25 kilograms per cubic  meter, but  may be allowed to  rise higher for up to 5 percent of the production cycle if the fish show other indicators  of good  welfare, such as low mortality,  and if water quality is considered good,  which would  normally mean water temperature below 12 degrees C, dissolved oxygen above 80 percent  saturation  and  little or  no  harmful  algae  present. Sudden  artificial  illumination  or  underwater  noise, and other environmental disturbances shall be limited.

Fish shall be harvested and transported  to  processing  plants or other markets in a manner that maintains temperature control and  minimizes  distress.  Before  slaughter,  they  shall  be stunned instantly by humane means. Carbon dioxide asphyxiation shall not be used.

If fish are hauled live to a processing plant, transport must be implemented  without  undue  delay,  and  the  time  and  stock-

## Salmon Farms

ing  density  controlled  according  to  prevailing conditions.  Dissolved-oxygen  levels  shall  be  maintained  above  80  percent saturation,  and  when  transporting  in  a  closed  system,  safe levels of  carbon  dioxide  shall be  established  and maintained. Transport density shall be determined by local conditions,  and fish volume shall not exceed 15 percent of the water volume. These harvesting  provisions  shall  apply  equally  to  farm  staff and subcontractors.

## 10. Animal Health and Welfare

## Biosecurity and Disease Management

Farms shall operate  with the aim of preventing infectious disease outbreaks, but when diseases or parasites infect farmed  fish, diagnosis and treatment  shall be carried  out promptly and  judiciously under  the  supervision of  a  fish health professional in a manner that minimizes impacts on the environment.

## Reasons for Standard

Infectious disease outbreaks at farms imply increased risks for disease transmission  to  surrounding  farm  sites  and,  in  some cases,  wild  fish  populations.  Diseases  also  show  themselves through poor performance and suffering in the affected fish.

Precautions  should  be  taken  in  salmon  farming  to  reduce the  likelihood  of  infection  and  clinical  disease, and  limit  their impacts by appropriate treatment if they occur.

## Salmon Farms

## Implementation

Biosecurity  shall  be  carried  out  under  the  direction  of  a  veterinarian  or  fish  health  professional  with  equivalent  qualifications,  who  is  accredited  or  licensed  by  the  governing  regulatory  authority  in  the  region/country  and  has the  legal authority to  prescribe the use of medicines. The fish health professional shall  develop  and  implement  a  Fish Health  Management  Plan (FHMP) that accomplishes disease prevention through biosecurity and, if needed, disease treatment.

The FHMP  shall  operate  at  two  levels:  at  the  farm  site  and among neighboring sites and aquaculture establishments within a defined area. The second level requires the establishment of an Area Management  Agreement  in  which  salmon  farmers  coordinate their activities with neighboring farms. (See Section 2.)

Additionally, the fish health professional shall ensure compli- ance with all legal requirements for disease testing, fish move- ments (including  zoosanitary  regulations  of  inbound  and  out-  bound transports), treatments for fish diseases and reporting of notifiable diseases, if these are identified or suspected.

## Farm Management Measures

The Fish Health Management Plan shall include but not be limited  to  written  biosecurity  and health management procedures, and  training  of  farm  staff  in  the  practice  of  these  procedures, including:

- ·  A plan for the cyclical production of fish that mandates a fallow period of at least eight weeks after the completion of harvesting and before restocking, and that is coordinated with neighboring BAP-certified farms and, where there is an established Area Management Agreement, with all farms in the AMA. (See Section 2.)
- ·  Assurance that only smolts certified clinically healthy and free of diseases and parasites specified in applicable national fish health regulations are brought onto the farm.
- ·  Vaccination of fish before they are brought onto a farm and revaccination, if needed, at the direction of the fish health professional.
- ·  Cleaning and disinfection of all fish-handling equipment before it enters or leaves the farm.
- ·  Management and/or limitation of 'visiting' vessels from sites of higher or unknown risk, and a supplemental plan for increased oversight in the event of disease concerns.
- ·  Disinfection or changes of footwear by all personnel entering or leaving the farm.
- ·  Accurate recording of all fish movements and transfers to, from and within the farm.
- ·  A requirement to move to the use of closed well boats when transporting fish, as methods and equipment become available.
- ·  Procedures for the accurate and regular cage-by-cage recording, examination and sanitary disposal of dead fish recovered as 'normal mortality' from cages.
- ·  An alert status that defines extra precautions, checks on fish and increased vigilance if an occurrence of infectious disease is known or suspected in the region.

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

- ·  A recovery and disposal plan for dead fish in the event of a mass kill, with available equipment in place and identified services that can be called on to help quickly.

## Diagnosis, Treatment

Written   procedures   for   fish   diagnosis   and   treatment   shall include:

- ·  Monitoring for endemic or locally identified parasitic, bacterial and viral infections, and recording of findings and actions taken, which may or may not be mandated by government.
- ·  Guidelines on indicators for disease that direct farm staff as they tend fish or remove dead fish from the cages, and provide procedures for timely reporting if an indicator is observed.
- ·  A written response plan to be followed by the fish health professional to ensure rapid diagnosis if disease is suspected, followed by prompt treatment.
- · Written procedures based on current guidelines for best professional veterinary practices (OIE 2019) on how medici- nal treatments with drugs, vaccines or anesthetics, and any non-medicinal use of chemicals (i.e., for disinfec- tion or water treatment) shall be selected and admin- istered in order to minimize risks to human health and the environment.
- ·  Written procedures for recording withdrawal times to minimize the risk of residues remaining in the fish.
- ·  Where possible and where the welfare of the fish will not be compromised by delay in treatment, a procedure for antibiotic sensitivity or resistance testing prior to each subsequent course of treatment with the same antibiotic and for recording of trends.

## Sea Lice

Farms shall comply  with  current  national or regional rulings on sea lice to minimize parasite reproduction  and optimize control. These may include setting limits for maximum levels of sea lice of  different  stages  on  the  farm's  fish  and  participation  in  coordinated  delousing  in regions where such coordination  arrangements  are  in  place.  Farms shall  follow  government  advice  on therapeutic  use  to  prevent  the  build-up of  resistance.  When practical  non-chemical  treatments  for  sea  lice  are  developed, their use may become a future BAP requirement.

Applicants  must be able to demonstrate that AMA rules and sea lice  management  procedures  have been written  for  the  protection  of  wild  salmon,  as  well  as  the  farmed  fish.  The  rules  and management shall include  monitoring  of  sea lice  loads  and  the setting of treatment trigger thresholds that take into account  key factors  such as season, the life cycle stages of farmed and wild fish, and the specific characteristics of the area in question.

## 11. Food Safety

## Control of Potential Food Safety Hazards

Farming practices shall prevent the introduction of potential consumer health hazards that could be encountered during consumption. Chemical residues and contaminants shall be controlled  and  kept  below  regulatory  limits  through  good farming practices and regular monitoring. Antibiotics, drugs and other chemical compounds that are proactively prohibited in producing or importing countries shall not be used.

## Reasons for Standard

Farmed salmon can  become  contaminated  at  several stages in the farming process.  Possible contaminants  include medicinal residues in smolts and/or juvenile fish brought on the farm from  outside sources  with inadequate  controls; microbial, chemical or other environmental contamination  in the unlikely situation  that  a  salmon  farm  is  located  close  to  a  source  of such  contaminants;  heavy  metals  or  PCBs/dioxins  in  fish feed; residues of medicinal compounds  used during the farming  process;  and  lubricants,  fuel,  paints  or  other  materials  to which  the  fish  might  be  exposed  when  they  are  harvested and transported  to  a processing  plant.  Fish can also become contaminated  by unclean water and transport containers used during transit to processing plants or markets.

Residues of  improperly  applied  therapeutic  agents can accumulate in fish tissue and present a potential health hazard to humans. Therefore, certain compounds  have been proactively prohibited  and residue limits  mandated  for  others. Irresponsible use of antibiotics  can also threaten human health by leading to antibiotic  resistance or impact  the surrounding  environment through accumulation of drug residues in the food chain.

Rarely, farmed salmon can become infested with certain parasites that  are potentially  transmissible to  humans unless adequate control measures are taken.

## Implementation

Farm sites shall be selected after review of possible sources of toxic  materials in the area consistent  with  the BAP standards in Section 4. Where a potential contamination  risk exists in the vicinity  or may affect  farm waters either from natural runoff or direct  discharge,  the farm shall check  for  that  contaminant  in the flesh of exposed fish on at least an annual basis.

To avoid possible contamination of fish, farms shall also:

- ·  Require suppliers of smolts or juvenile fish to provide written assurance that the fish have been reared without the use of medicinals or substances that are proactively prohibited in food animals in the producing and importing country, and that the hatcheries in which they were produced were compliant with the regulations under which they operate.
- ·  Require feed suppliers to provide written assurances that levels of heavy metals and pesticides in feed are below the limits set for these contaminants in the

## BAP Standards, Guidelines

countries in which they operate, and that ingredients are traceable to the source. (See Section 5).

- ·  Require feed suppliers to provide written assurances regarding the types and amounts of medicinals used in feeds, and maintain records for the use of any medicated feed.
- ·  Limit the use of medicinals under strict supervision of licensed veterinary expertise that accounts for responsible use of approved drugs, treatments and withdrawal times, and complies with guidelines for any use of new investigational animal drugs.
- ·  Prepare and implement written procedures for nonmedicinal use of chemicals (i.e., for disinfection or water treatment) to minimize risks to human health and risks of unacceptable emissions to the environment.
- ·  Identify and list local parasite species that may infest farmed salmon and which are potentially transmissible to humans unless adequate control measures are put in place, and develop and implement written control procedures to minimize the risk of infestation, for example, by not using any raw feed ingredients unless they have been subjected to treatments known to kill any potentially harmful parasites.
- ·  Maintain sanitation control procedures for transport waters, ice and containers to prevent contamination during transport or temporary holding. When fish are placed on ice at the farm at harvest, the process must be done properly, or the quality of the flesh can deteriorate. Alternating layers of ice and fish are recommended to avoid temperature fluctuations.

- 11.8: Ice in which fish are placed following harvest shall be made from potable water or  seawater that has been disinfected to an equivalent standard.

## 12. Traceability

## Record-Keeping Requirement

tories can also be included.  Traceability ultimately assures purchasers that all steps in the production  process were in compliance with environmental, social and food safety standards.

To establish product traceability, the following data shall be recorded for each culture unit and each production cycle:

- •  culture unit identification number
- •  unit area or volume
- •  stocking date
- •  common and scientific names of fish
- •  quantity of smolts stocked
- •  source of smolts (hatchery)
- •  antibiotic and drug use
- •  herbicide and other pesticide use
- •  manufacturer and lot number for each feed used
- •  movement of fish among cages
- •  unusual events that could affect quality or safety
- •  results of tests for contaminants before harvest
- •  harvest date
- •  harvest method
- •  harvest quantity
- •  transport method

## Reasons for Requirement

Product traceability is a crucial component  of the BAP program. It  connects  the  links  in  the  production  chain  and  allows  tracing of each processed lot back to the culture unit and inputs of origin. Food quality and safety analyses by accredited  labora-

## Implementation

Farms may utilize any traceability  system that  meets the BAP requirements.  This  can  be  an  online  system;  a  farm's  own in-house  database,  paper  records,  files  and  documents;  or  a combination thereof.

Where paper  records,  documents  or  notebooks  are  used,  if possible,  the  information  should  also  be  transferred  to  computer database files to allow electronic transmission. The original files or paper records shall be kept to allow for verification of the electronic data.

The record-keeping  process requires a high degree of care and organization. At large farms, managers could  collect  initial data for  those aquaculture products  for  which  they are responsible. A single clerk or team could then be given the task of collecting the data from managers and transferring it to a computer  database.  Farm management shall, of  course,  review the  effort  at intervals to verify it satisfies BAP requirements.

## Product Identity Preservation

To assure the integrity of the Best Aquaculture Practices 'star' system,  traceability  controls  must  be  in  place  that  allow  verification  of  all  facilities  that  contribute  to  the  claim  of  multiple-star BAP-certified status.

## Salmon Farms

To insure the proper separation and traceability of all farm inputs and outputs, the following components must be in place:

- ·  Farms that purchase all of their smolts and feed from BAP-certified sources shall maintain records of the sources of stocking material and feeds used.
- ·  Farms that purchase stocking material and feed from both BAP- and non-BAP-certified sources shall identify all sources and have adequate systems in place to prevent mixing of BAP and non-BAP production lots.
- ·  T o enable mass balance verification of multiple-star products, certified farms shall maintain a list, including harvest dates and volumes, of the facilities to which they sell or deliver products.
- ·  The number of backward and forward trace exercises conducted by the auditor will be determined by farm volume.

## Standards

- 12.1: The facility shall operate an effective record-keeping system that provides timely, organized, accurate entries, performed and overseen by a designated trained person or team responsible for collecting the data, ensuring it is complete and accurate, and that traceability requirements are met.
- 12.2: The facility shall keep complete and accurate records for each culture unit and production  cycle, including the culture unit identification number, unit area and volume, species stocked and, if applicable, species specifications such as triploid.
- 12.3: The facility shall keep complete and accurate records concerning any antibiotic, pesticide or other drug use at the farm.
- 12.4: Complete and accurate records regarding manufacturer and lot numbers for each feed used shall be maintained.
- 12.5: The facility shall maintain complete and accurate records of the sources and numbers of juvenile fish (smolts) stocked, stocking dates and all feeds used for each culture unit.
- 12.6: Complete and accurate records regarding the harvest date, harvest quantity, movement document number (if applicable) and receiving processing plant(s) or purchaser(s) shall be maintained. If product  lots are destined to more than one plant or purchaser, each lot shall be separately identified.
- 12.7: In order to use the BAP logo, facilities shall have such use approved and registered in advance with BAP Management.
- 12.8: The facility shall keep records of any customer complaints related to its products'  compliance with the BAP standards.
- 12.9: The facility shall keep records of investigations of such complaints and actions taken to address/correct  them.
- 12.10: All records specified in Section 12 shall be retained for a period that exceeds both 12 months and the expected shelf life of the aquaculture products.

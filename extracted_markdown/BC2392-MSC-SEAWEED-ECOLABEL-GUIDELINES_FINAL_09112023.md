ASC-MSC Seaweed Label User Guide

## Label use guidelines - seaweed products

The ASC and MSC have released a joint standard for environmentally sustainable and socially responsible seaweed production. The ASC and MSC labels are assets that can be licenced for use to communicate an entity's participation in this program.

Label use on product must be to identify seaweed that has been purchased from an unbroken Chain of Custody (CoC) certified supply chain.

The participating organisation shall only use the MSC and/or ASC label if it has been granted approval to do so under the terms of the Seaweed Partnership Agreement.

Questions or further information: ecolabel@msc.org.

Seaweed products may use the ASC label, MSC label, or both (co-label), depending on the production category assigned in the operation's Public Certification Report, as shown below:

## Joint ASC and MSC label use

The ASC and MSC labels are for use primarily as a certification mark on certified products and packaging. They may also be used when talking about certified products and on items such as menus.

As a certification mark and trademark, strict rules govern the display of the ASC and MSC labels both on-product and off-product. To secure approval to use the label on packaging, all material must be submitted to the MSCI licensing team for approval prior to printing via ecolabel@msc.org.

B2B use of the labels should follow this guide but there is no requirement to submit for product approval.

## Co-branding and joint communications

In instances where the two labels are used together with other elements, such as a standard strapline or campaign graphic, a lock-up should be created to ensure use by partners is consistent.

For more information on using the labels off-pack - for example as part of marketing material - please request a copy of the ASC-MSC Seaweed Standard Branding Guidelines from ecolabel@msc.org.

## Joint label use - application

Examples on the right show how to display the labels together. ASC is positioned on the left and MSC on the right, as the shapes work better in this orientation.

Labels must be fully legible on all products.

General rules on the use of the ASC logo and the MSC ecolabel are outlined in the:

ASC Logo user guide https://asc-aqua.org/business/our-label/

## MSC Ecolabel user guide

https://www.msc.org/documents/logo-use/msc-ecolabel-user-guide

## Respect the space around labels

When each label is produced the clear space around it must be:

- · t least 2mm for product specific text (such as species, a weight, ingredients).
- · at least 5mm for general design elements (such as brand names, logos) where either label could be associated with the host brand)

## Joint ASC-MSC labels

Claim text in Helvetica or Ariel font. Use a minimum clear space of 2mm (or 10% of the height of the label for larger sizes).

Respect the space around labels as defined in ASC logo user guide and MSC ecolabel user guide.

## Joint label use - application

## Positioning

Use the version of joint labels deemed appropriate to suit the size and shape of the product or packaging. For instance, on the lid of a small can or jar, the portrait versions would work best.

The joint labels must go next to the part of the product that is considered the front, i.e. next to the brand and product name.

## Size

Size is important and the labels should be equally proportioned next to each other.

MSC minimum sizing:

Horizontal - H 10mm  W 26.1mm

Vertical - H 18.8mm  W 14mm

ASC mimimum sizing:

Horizontal - H 10mm  W 20.7mm Vertical - H 23.1mm  W 14mm

The labels should be equally proportioned next to each other. Always make sure you scale the labels up or down proportionately.

Smaller packaging - if you are having difficulty incorporating our labels as specified in the guide please get in touch with the Licensing team via ecolabel@msc.org.

## Certified ingredient percentage rule

Products with certified seaweed should meet the ingredient rule that 95% of the total seaweed content must be certified.

This rule is modelled on the ingredient rules implemented in the MSC seafood program and the ASC seafood program.

## Non-certified seaweed ingredients

A product carrying the ASC and/or MSC labels may contain 5% non-certified seaweed in the total seaweed content.

You can calculate the percentage of n0n certified seaweed ingredients in a product by using the following formula:

Total net weight of non certified seaweed ingredients*

Total weight of the combined certified and non certified seaweed ingredients in the finished product*

*excluding water and added salt

When communicating the non-certified ingredient percentage rule, categories are: MSC seafood ASC seafood , and ASC-MSC .

Exceptional scenarios

Products with certified seafood (ASC and/or MSC) and certified seaweed

- A) The total seafood ingredient content must reach 95% certified and;
- B) The total seaweed ingredient content must reach 95% certified

Standard seafood rules apply. i.e. labelling is allowed with an accompanying seafood claim

No label use is acceptable but a seaweed only claim may be displayed on the back of pack

## Which Chain of Custody (CoC) code to use

Seaweed will be represented by a CoC certificate with the following code format SWD-C-#####. The code will be provided by your certifier or supplier.

Products with certified seafood (ASC and/or MSC) and certified seaweed that meet the certified ingredient percentage rule may use the label/s in accordance with the usual co-labelling rules.

The Chain of Custody number of the certificate that covers the main species used in the product is displayed on pack. All CoC codes (ASC-MSC Seaweed, ASC and MSC) may be referenced on pack if desired.

For example, if the mixture contains 60% MSC certified salmon and 35% ASC certified salmon and 5% ASC-MSC certified seaweed, the MSC CoC code needs to be used. The ASC and ASC-MSC Seaweed codes can also be used if desired.

## Which claims to use

A claim is required for any certified ingredient that makes up greater than 5% of a product. Claims that would be required to be on pack would be as follows:

| Ingredients              | Required claims                                                                                     | Where to find the claims                      |

## Certified seaweed claims

The ASC or MSC label should always be accompanied by a claim. It should be shown in the language(s) of the country where the product or material is sold or published and match the language used in the label.

If you require translation of a seaweed claim, please contact ecolabel@msc.org.

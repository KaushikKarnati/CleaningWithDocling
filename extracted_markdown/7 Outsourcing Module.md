## A Introduction

Outsourcing, as defined by the Global Seafood Alliance, is when a facility transfers a temporary part of the production process, including storage, primary packaging, labelling, slaughter, or product transformation, to an alternate site (herein referred to as the outsourced facility) to perform an intermediate production process on materials supplied by the processing facility seeking SPS certification (herein referred to as the primary facility).  Facilities conducting outsourced activities could be under the same or different ownership as  the  primary  facility;  however,  control  and  final  product  must  be  maintained  at  the  primary  facility. Outsourced processed products must be returned to and/or be under full control of the primary facility for final processing and/or distribution.

## B  Scope

This module applies to primary facilities that outsource any processes that may have an impact on food safety, legality, quality, traceability, or social responsibility. Eligible Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) farmed raised species and wild caught species are included in this scope.

## C Clause Requirements

- OSP1
- The primary facility shall exercise proper control over any entity that is used to outsource any processes that may have an impact on food safety, legality, quality,  traceability, or social responsibility. In addition to the criteria within this module, control measures shall include either of the following:
- a) Outsourced  facility's  valid  and  current  certification  against  GSA  Seafood  Processing Standard; or
- b) On-site audit of the outsourced facility by the primary facility's competent internal auditor conducted annually to include the full scope of the current version of Seafood Processing Standard and all relevant modules.
- OSP1.1 Under OSP1 option b, the primary facility's internal auditors shall be trained and competent to  conduct  internal  audits.  Auditor  competency  can  be  demonstrated  by  conducting  a witness audit with a trained internal auditor and meeting one of the requirements stated below:
- · Attendance and successfully completing a GSA auditor training course; or
- · Successfully completed industry recognized internal auditor training.
- The  CB  auditor  shall  verify  the  internal  audit  (if  applicable)  has  been  conducted  per  the requirements of the current edition of the Seafood Processing Standard and all its applicable
- OSP2 modules.
- OSP3 All nonconformances resulting from the outsourced facility internal audit shall have been accepted and closed in the timeframe allotted by the internal auditor.
- OSP4 The primary facility shall only outsource processing services to suppliers who are approved in their Supplier Approval Program.
- OSP5 Specifications for outsourced processing services shall be developed and implemented by the primary facility and included as part of a signed contract or service agreement between the primary facility and the outsourced facility.
- OSP6 Any changes to contracted processes, ingredients, or packaging materials shall be approved in advance by the primary facility.
- OSP7 The primary facility shall keep an up-to-date list of all entities to which they are outsourcing processing services and the specific activities/services that are outsourced to each. This list shall be reviewed and updated at least annually.
- OSP8 The  primary  facility  shall  appoint  a  designated  management  person  or  persons  with  the authority to approve and/or disapprove outsourced processing services and each associated service provider.
- OSP9 Specifications shall be  kept up-to-date and periodically reviewed  and documented, which shall occur at a minimum, annually. Specifications shall be readily available for reference by designated personnel.
- OSP10 The primary facility shall not outsource the peeling and de-heading of shrimp to informal entities known as 'peeling or de-heading sheds'. To be eligible for SPS certification, peeling and/or  de-heading  of  shrimp  shall  only  occur  in  establishments  with  valid  government approvals and with legal, food safety, environmental and social criteria in place which shall be subject to audits as stated in OSP1. Such establishments are either:
- · owned by the primary facility or;
- · completely controlled by the primary facility with valid agreements in place or;
- · are located onsite of the primary facility or located within a 90 minute or less commute to the primary facility and included as part of the scope of the annual SPS audit.
- OSP11 The procedures and records shall clearly show controls and traceability at all steps: chain of custody evidence from the outsourced facility (country of origin, for example), transport to the outsourced facility, during handling, production, and/or storage at the outsourced facility, and during transport from the outsourced facility back to the primary facility.

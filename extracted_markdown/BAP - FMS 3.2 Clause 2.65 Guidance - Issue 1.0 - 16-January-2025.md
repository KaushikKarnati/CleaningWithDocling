## BAP Standard Guidance

January 13, 2025

The Best Aquaculture Program's Feed Mill Standard Issue 3.0 (now in Issue 3.2) introduced restrictions concerning the production of medicated feeds containing antimicrobials listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Critically Important for Human Medicine , which is now in its 6 th Revision (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241515528).  The WHO, in recognition of the importance of antimicrobials in safeguarding both human and animal health, began working in 2023 on a 7th revision of this list that will be renamed as the WHO Medically Important Antimicrobial List .  WHO in the meanwhile has published a risk management tool, the WHOList of Medically Important Antimicrobials: A risk management tool for mitigating antimicrobial resistance due to non-human use :

This WHO MIA risk management tool was a joint effort of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ), the United Nations Environmental Programme ( UNEP ) and the World Organisation for Animal Health ( WOAH ), and aligns the four organizations' guidance and lists concerning antibiotic use.  New terminology was introduced that re-grouped antimicrobials under new classifications including ' authorized for use in humans only ', ' authorized for use in both humans and animals ', and ' not authorized for use in humans '.  Sub-classifications under the category 'authorized for use in both humans and animals' now include HPCIA (Highest Priority Critically Important Antimicrobials) and CIA (Critically Important Antimicrobials), and animal use of antimicrobials from either of these categories must always be accompanied by proper safeguards.

In consideration of this updated guidance from the WHO, BAP has revised its policy concerning CIA's in the current Feed Mill Standard Issue 3.2 clause 2.65 as follows:

FMS 3.2 clause 2.65: The facility shall not use antimicrobials designated by the WHO Medically Important Antibiotic (MIA) List as 'authorized for use in humans only' in medicated feed.  Use of drugs classified as either a Highest Priority Critically Important Antimicrobial (HPCIA) or Critically Important Antimicrobial CIA by the WHO as 'authorized for both humans and animals' shall be minimized, used only under the advice of a qualified veterinarian, and only where such use has been approved by relevant national legislation.

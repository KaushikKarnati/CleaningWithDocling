## 1. Introduction

The  Marine  Stewardship  Council  (MSC)  and  the  Aquaculture  Stewardship  Council  (ASC)  are independent not for profit organisations founded in 1996 by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Unilever and in 2010 by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH) respectively. They are both leaders in certification and labelling programs for responsibly produced seafood.

The MSC vision is of the world's oceans teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations.

The mission of the MSC is to use our ecolabel and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world's oceans by recognising and rewarding sustainable fishing practices, influencing the choices people make when buying seafood, and working with our partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis.

The vision of the ASC is a world where aquaculture plays a major role in supplying food and social benefits for mankind whilst minimising negative impacts on the environment.

The goal of the ASC is to transform aquaculture towards an environmentally and socially responsible food source. The ASC aims to achieve this by promoting standards for best environmental and social aquaculture performance and rewarding responsible farming practices through standard setting and certification.

All  MSC  and  ASC standards have been developed following the ISEAL Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental Standards (Standard Setting Code) and FAO Guidelines.

MSC  and  ASC  seek  to  jointly  develop  a  Seaweed  Standard  for  certifying  sustainable  seaweed operations. The two organisations have developed the standard setting procedure described in this document specifically to apply to their joint development of a Seaweed Standard.

The joint vision and mission of the ASC and MSC in developing this Seaweed Standard is to contribute to  the  health  of  the  world's  aquatic  ecosystems by recognising, and rewarding through certification, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible seaweed harvesting and farming practices.

## 2. Purpose

This procedure sets out steps for assuring quality and credibility of standard setting activities that are implemented by the MSC, ASC and their relevant governance bodies.

## 6. Governance structure and responsibility

- 6.1. The MSC Board of Trustees (BOT) is the ultimate decision-making body of the MSC. It takes the decision to develop a new standard or to revise a current one. The BOT also approves the final  version of any standards newly developed or revised, based on recommendations of the Seaweed Standard Committee (SSC).
- 6.2. The ASC Supervisory Board (SB) is the ultimate decision-making body of the ASC. It takes the decision to develop a new standard or to revise a current one. The SB also approves the final version of any standards newly developed or revised, based on recommendations of the SSC.
- 6.3. The Seaweed Standard Committee (SSC) is created with powers of decision making within the process, granted by the ASC and MSC Boards, to manage all aspects of the standard setting process of the Seaweed Standard with the exception of the final formal approval of the Seaweed Standard, which resides with the MSC and ASC Boards. The SSC is comprised of members of the MSC and ASC Boards, and their technical advisory bodies. There are four additional nonvoting stakeholder members. The SSC may seek non-voting observers to advise them, drawn from  industry,  science  and  eNGOs,  and  the  respective  ASC/MSC  stakeholder  governance bodies.
- 6.4. Technical Working Groups (TWGs) are formed as deemed necessary by the SSC. They will provide the process with inputs on technical issues of the standard.
- 6.5. The MSC Secretariat leads the coordination and facilitation of the process working with the ASC Secretariat . Content is developed jointly with the ASC Secretariat. For each standard setting and revision  process,  a  staff  member  is  appointed  to  be  the  Coordinator  and  the  central  contact person.

## 7. ASC and MSC guiding principles for standard setting

The ASC and MSC use their standards to achieve their missions and visions. Therefore, it is important that  both  the  process  of  standard  setting  and  the  standard  themselves  observe  widely  recognised credibility principles.

- 7.1 Improvement  The  standard  is  reviewed,  and  if  necessary  revised,  every  five  years,  at  a minimum. This allows the MSC and ASC to incorporate learning from stakeholders' feedback and from the Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) program. Performance levels will be adjusted over time to reflect new science and improved management practices.
- 7.2 Relevance Seaweeds play a key role in the aquatic ecosystem. With global seaweed production increasing  along  with  demand  for  certification  of  the  seaweed  industry,  the  ASC  and  MSC recognise  the  importance  of  having  a  standard  that  rewards  those  producing  seaweed sustainably,  minimising  effects  on  aquatic  ecosystems  as  well  as  providing  a  benchmark  for improvement. The standard will be updated where there is improved scientific understanding, with widespread scientific support, to demonstrate that a change in the performance requirement is necessary to achieve the intentions of our Principles and Indicators, and there is improved fishery and farm management best practice, with growing support in industry management and policy circles, that is accepted as being required and appropriate to achieve the relevant FAO Codes of Conduct, and by implication our Principles and Indicators. The standard should be objectively verifiable.  The  standard's  requirements  are  formulated  in  a  way  that  facilitates  consistent interpretation and verification.
- 7.3 Rigour The standard is based on performance outcomes from implementing operations that represent the sector's best practices across different regions. Principles :  High-level goals that once  achieved  would  contribute  to  achieving  the  defined  outcome; Performance  Indicators : Issues against which performance can be measured to in a specific area; Scoring Guideposts : Specific  performance  levels  to  be  reached  which  will  determine  if  the  desired  impact  will  be achieved.
- 7.4 Engagement Multiple  stakeholder  groups  are proactively engaged throughout the standard setting process, from the initial feedback through the decision-making stages. Final decisions are taken by the MSC BOT and ASC SB, which includes a variety of stakeholder interest groups.
- 7.5 Transparency All information of the standard setting process except confidential minutes of the SSC and other internal meetings is made publicly available on the ASC and MSC websites. The information  is  kept  up-to-date,  including  the  TOR,  synopsis  and  all  public  comments,  draft version(s) of the standard, and the final (valid) version of the standard.
- 7.6 Accessibility The standard's requirements are not overly burdensome. The standard does not create obstacles to trade or exclude small-scale operations from market access. The standard and guidance documents are translated into different languages as deemed necessary.

## 8. Standard setting process

## 8.1 Assess needs for new standard or review/revision of existing one

## Input :

- -Existing standard;
- -Issue Log (on existing/non-existing standard);
- -Monitoring and Evaluation data on existing standard performance

Output : Identified and justified needs for new standard or for early or regular review/revision of existing one.

Coordinated by : MSC Secretariat

- 8.1.2  Any interested stakeholder is encouraged to share their feedback, concerns and proposals to develop new standard or review/revise an existing one. Feedback or proposals can be sent to the MSC at any time at: seaweedstandard@msc.org.
- 8.1.3  MSC staff members, who receive feedback and proposals from the ASC or from stakeholders via email, phone, or face-to-face meeting, will log them centrally in the Seaweed Issue Log.
- 8.1.4  At least once a year, the SSC reviews the Seaweed Issue Log to identify needs for standard development or early review/revision. Critical issues may be dealt with at any point in time in between the Seaweed Issue Log review intervals.
- 8.1.5  The identified needs must be justifiable in terms of the standard's objectives, free-of-redundancy and where reasonable must facilitate increased alignment with other standard schemes.
- 8.1.6  All substantive changes to the content of a standard will require the full standard development process described in this Section 8 with the exception of consultation where the standard is being revised. Only one round of public consultation is required where no unresolved issues persist and where feedback from the first round was sufficient.
- 8.1.7  Non-substantive changes (correcting typographical errors, changing structure and formatting) can be implemented by the Secretariat.
- 8.1.8  Early review may be justified based on:
- a. New scientific development and its adoption as best practice by industry;
- b. Information relevant to the standard but not previously considered;
- c. Changes to the operational practices in the sector relevant to the standard;
- d. Change in legislation where the producers are based;
- e. Significant change in the supply chain.

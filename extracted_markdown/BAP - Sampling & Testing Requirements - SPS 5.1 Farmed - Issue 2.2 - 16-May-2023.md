## Aquaculture/Farm Raised Products

## Supplementary Sampling and Laboratory Testing Instructions

## (Issue 2.2 - 16-May-2023)

## Seafood Processing Standard (SPS)

## (Current Issue)

Use in conjunction with SPS ANNEX 4 - Sampling and Testing Verification Requirement

## 1.0 Primary Product Forms

As referred to in the SPS - 'Primary Product Form' examples are:

- · fresh
- · raw ready-to-eat (e.g. sashimi, sushi)
- · raw frozen
- · raw breaded
- · cooked breaded
- · cooked
- · dumpling
- · smoked - cold
- · smoked - hot
- · pickled
- · dried
- · canned
- · salted
- · marinated

Raw frozen product forms, for the purpose of this definition, include all raw IQF or block frozen products expected  to  have  the  same  hazards  (e.g.  microbiological).  Examples  include:  deveined,  peeled  and deveined, whole, de-headed, butterfly tail on.

## Example 1 - Primary Product Forms :

A seafood processing facility produces the following product forms of L. vannamei : cooked, breaded, raw ready to eat, marinated, and 3 forms of pealed and/or deveined for a total of 7 products:

-  The number of primary product forms to be sampled = 5, (Cooked, breaded, raw ready-to-eat, marinated, and raw).
-  When sampling, primary product forms are based on a per species basis. So, If the facility above was also producing raw P. monodon in frozen block and IQF, that would be 5 primary product forms for L. vannamei and 1 for P. monodon .

## 2.0 Sampling Instructions

## 2.1 Number of Samples

- a. The number of samples to collect per species is based on annual production volumes of  each BAP certifiable species produced at the processing facility according to Table 1 below.

Table 1. Volume (total production in MT) for last calendar year of individual species and sample collection size per species

| Volume (MT)  per species   |   Number of Samples  per Species |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 0-1,000                    |                                4 |
| 1,001-3,000                |                                8 |
| &gt;3000                      |                               12 |

## Example 2 - Number of samples per species :

A processing facility previous year's production record states the following:

- L. vannamei 3,500 MT
- P. monodon 1,200 MT
- O. niloticus 800 MT

On the day of sampling, the following product forms are observed in inventory and storage: White shrimp ( L. vannamei ) - raw frozen IQF, raw frozen block, breaded frozen, cooked frozen Black tiger shrimp ( P. monodon ) - raw frozen IQF, raw frozen block Nile tilapia ( O. niloticus ) - raw frozen fillet, breaded frozen fillet

Total number of samples to take from various lots in the inventory = 24 as follows:

-  L.  vannamei = 12 samples randomly selected between raw, breaded and cooked primary product forms. In this instance, raw frozen IQF and raw frozen block are considered a single primary product form.
-  P. monodon = 8 samples randomly collected between raw production lots.
-  O. niloticus = 4 samples randomly selected between fillet and breaded production lots.

An acceptable sample collection for the above example is shown below:

| L. vannamei      |   # Samples |
|------------------|-------------|
| Raw frozen IQF   |           2 |
| Raw frozen block |           3 |
| Breaded frozen   |           4 |
| Cooked frozen    |           3 |
| Total            |          12 |

| P. monodon       |   # Samples |
|------------------|-------------|
| Raw frozen IQF   |           4 |
| Raw frozen block |           4 |
| Total            |           8 |

| O. niloticus      | # Samples   |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Raw frozen fillet | 2           |
| Breaded frozen    | 2           |
| Total             |             |

total primary product forms = 3

primary product forms = 1

primary product forms = 2

## 2.2 Sample Collection Requirements

- a.   Compositing of samples is to be conducted by a qualified third-party laboratory and not the sampler.
- b.   Collect up to twelve samples (750 grams each) as described above from among the primary product forms of finished products that are in the active inventory from various lots available at the processing plant at the time of the audit.
- c. In cases where a processing plant does not have the required number of different production lots in inventory for each species (which may occur in small plants or in plants that produce only fresh products), additional samples will have to be collected from  higher- risk or highervolume production lots to reach the required number of samples.
- d.   For Seafood Processing Plants that also process wild-caught species, please refer to PI Interpretation Guidelines - Sampling &amp; Testing Requirement - Wild - Issue 2.0. Additional samples shall be collected for wild-caught species under separate instructions. These instructions in this document are for aquaculture/farm raised products only.
- e.   Aseptic sampling protocols shall be followed at all times.
- f. Sampling shall be conducted in accordance with SPS ANNEX 4, sections  A4\_1.0-3.0 and Table I.
- g.   Samplers shall organize and obtain equipment necessary to conduct the sampling: thermo- cool boxes, sterile polyethylene bags (confirm with the assigned laboratory concerning their standard procedures, as they may refuse the samples if improper packaging procedures are used), heatsealing machines (normally available at the facility), and permanent markers (do not attempt to use stickers, as they may not stick properly to sample bags).
- h.   DO NOT USE permanent markers that may contain prohibited dyes utilized in aquaculture (example black Sharpie markers) to identify the alphanumeric codes on sample bags.
- i. Samplers shall organize the traceability/chain of custody information related to samples  that will be collected and document these details.
- j. Samplers shall inform the lab of the expected date and time for delivery of samples - especially if it is out of normal business hours for the lab, so that they can make arrangement to store the samples accordingly.
- k. Samples shall be packaged in an outer package containing only individual samples from  a single species.

## 3.0 Laboratory Testing Instructions

- a. Testing laboratories must be accredited to ISO 17025.
- b. Compositing of samples is allowed given the following conditions:
- i. Compositing is to be conducted by a qualified third-party laboratory and not by the sampler.
- ii. Before compositing is done, samples shall be split so there will be reserve portions of each sample available in case follow-up breakout testing for one or more parameters is required.
- iii. No more than 4 samples can be combined into a single composite.
- iv. No compositing between aquaculture (farm raised) products and wild-caught fishery  products is allowed.
- v. Compositing  across  primary  product  forms  is  acceptable  for  drug  residue  testing  ONLY. Mixing primary product forms is NOT allowed for microbiological tests.
- c. Testing shall be in accordance with SPS ANNEX 4 Tables I, II, III.
- d. Laboratories shall determine the number of tests based on the number of samples received per species according to Table 2 (below). MT is provided as a reference only for laboratories as they will be unaware of plant volumes.

Microbiological and Drug Residue Testing can be determined as follows:

## Microbiological Testing:

-  L. vannamei: 12 samples total and 3 primary product forms. Number of microbiological tests required = 3 (Table 2). Composite up to 4 individual samples per composite by primary product form. Raw frozen IQF and raw frozen block are considered a single primary product form and can be composited together.
-  P. monodon: 8 samples total and 1 primary product form. Number of microbiological tests required = 2.  Composite 4 individual samples per composite in any combination. Note that since all samples are raw primary product forms the 8 samples can be composited into 2 composites of 4 samples each without restrictions.
-  O. niloticus : 4 samples total and 2 primary product forms. Number of microbiological tests required = 2.  Lots obtained are from different primary product forms and cannot be composited.

Examples of acceptable composites:

Composite  1:  two  samples  (lots)  each  of  raw  frozen  IQF  and  raw  frozen block

Composite 2: four samples breaded frozen

Composite 3: three samples cooked frozen

Examples of acceptable composites: Composite 1: two lots of raw frozen fillet Composite 2: two lots of breaded frozen

## Drug Residue Testing:

-  L. vannamei: 12 samples total. Number of drug residue tests required = 2 (Table 2). Composite 4 individual samples per composite in any combination. When possible, laboratories may try to  separate  raw  with  cooked  samples  in  compositing;  however,  mixing  across  primary product forms is acceptable for drug residue testing. Note that in this case a maximum of 8 samples could be combined into 2 composites (2 composites containing 4 samples each), leaving 4 samples untested for drug  residues.
-  P. monodon: 8 samples total. Number of drug residue tests required = 2. Composite 4 individual samples per composite in any  combination.
-  O. niloticus :  4  samples  total.  Number of drug residue tests required =  1.  Composite 4  individual samples into 1 composite.

## 4.0 Detections

## 4.1 Microbiological Detections

A detection on a composite requires breakout testing (of individual samples) only if the result exceeds GSABAP Action Levels (SPS ANNEX 4 Table II). E. coli and Staphylococcus results showing detections but not exceeding GSA-BAP Action Levels are to be reported as detections and not failures for that composite.

## 4.2 Drug Residue Detections

A drug residue detection on a composite that is proportionately capable of exceeding GSA-BAP Action Levels specified in SPS ANNEX 4 Table III shall be broken out into individual samples (using the reserve portions of the associated sample lots) for confirmatory testing to determine which sample production lot(s) may be adulterated. Table 4 provides BAP guidelines for laboratories to use for breakout testing when a composite detection is obtained.  NOTE:  Table 4 is to be used as a guideline only and may not be applicable at very

low Action Levels (i.e. table values may be below the sensitivity capability of the testing equipment).

In the event that breakout testing is conducted, ONLY THE SAMPLES IN THE COMPOSITE PRODUCING THE DETECTION SHALL BE RETESTED (USING THE RESERVE PORTIONS), AND ONLY FOR THOSE PARAMETER(s) THAT RESULTED IN A POSITIVE DETECTION.

Example 4 - Determination of breakout testing for a composite detection:

The testing laboratory conducts drug residue tests per SPS ANNEX 4 on a composite consisting of 3 individual samples. Results indicate a positive detection for Chloramphenicol at a 0.15 µg/kg. Per SPS ANNEX 4, the GSA-BAP Action Level for Chloramphenicol is listed as 0.3 µg/kg or ppb. Using the guideline in Table 4, any value ≥ 0. 12 µg/kg would initiate breakout of the composite, and the 4 3 samples that comprise the composite must be retested individually for Chloramphenicol.

## 5.0 Failures

## 5.1 Microbiological Test Failures

- a. Individual  samples  testing  above  the  GSA-BAP  Action  Levels  in  SPS  ANNEX  4  Table  II  are considered a Failed  Test Result.
- b. Any composite testing above GSA-BAP Action Levels for Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., or Listeria  monocytogenes stated  in  SPS  ANNEX  4 Table II,  requires  immediate  notification  by  the testing laboratory to the overseeing Certification Body and GSA-BAP. All potential violative sample production lots shall be identified within the notification. Once the notification has been established, the  laboratory  shall  proceed  with  confirmatory  testing  on  individual  samples  comprised  in  the composite of detection for the Microbiological Criteria detected to determine the violative sample production lot(s).

## 5.2 Drug Residue Failures

- a. A Drug Residue Detection on an individual sample testing above the 'GSA-BAP Action Level' value listed in SPS ANNEX 4 Table III is considered a Failed Test Result.
- b. A Drug Residue Detection that is above the Testing Laboratory's LOQ, but below the 'GSA-BAP Action Level' value listed in SPS ANNEX 4 Table III is considered a 'Detection'.

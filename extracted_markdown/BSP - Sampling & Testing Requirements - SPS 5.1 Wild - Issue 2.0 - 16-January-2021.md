## Wild-Caught Products

## Supplementary Sampling and Laboratory Testing Instructions (Issue 2.0 - 16-January-2021)

## Seafood Processing Standard (SPS)

## (Current Issue)

Use in conjunction with SPS ANNEX 4 - Sampling and Testing Verification Requirement

## 1.0 Primary Product Forms

As referred to in the SPS - 'Primary Product Form' examples are:

- · fresh
- · raw ready-to-eat (e.g. sashimi, sushi)
- · raw frozen
- · raw breaded
- · cooked breaded
- · cooked
- · dumpling
- · smoked - cold
- · smoked - hot
- · pickled
- · dried
- · canned
- · salted
- · marinated

Raw frozen product forms, for the purpose of this definition, include all raw IQF or block frozen products expected  to  have  the  same  hazards  (e.g.  microbiological).  Examples  include:  deveined,  peeled  and deveined, whole, de-headed, butterfly tail on.

## Example 1 - Primary Product Form :

A  seafood  processing  facility  produces  the  following  product  forms  of  one  species  of  pink  shrimp (P. borealis) : cooked, breaded, raw ready to eat, marinated, and 3 forms of peeled and/or deveined for a total of 7 products:

-  The number of Primary Product Forms to be sampled = 5, (Cooked, breaded, raw ready-to-eat, marinated, and raw).
-  When sampling, primary product forms are based on a per species basis. So, If the facility above was also producing raw Argentine Red Shrimp P. muelleri in frozen block and IQF, that would be 5 primary product forms for P. borealis and 1 for P. muelleri .

## 2.0 Sampling Instructions

## 2.1 Number of Samples

- a. Twelve (12) samples total shall be collected from across a maximum of 3 different  species from various lots in the inventory.  The number of samples per species depends on the number of species sampled (Table 1).
- b. In the event that less than 3 species are present at the time of sampling, samplers shall  collect 12 samples total in equal numbers from the species that are present at the time of sampling (Table 1).
- c. Species and product forms to be selected must be based on risk.
- i. If Mercury susceptible species (Table 2) are present, at least 4 samples must be collected from one of the species.
- ii. If  Histamine  susceptible  species  (Appendix  A)  are  present,  at  least  4  samples  must be collected from one of the species.
- iii. Samples must be selected from one or more RTE primary products forms (e.g. smoked, sushi, etc.) if they are present at the time of sampling.
- iv. Samples must be selected from the same primary product form within a species when three or more species are present, but samplers should attempt to take different  primary product forms from different species in order to cover as many primary product forms as possible.

Table 1. Sample collection sizes for wild-caught species based on the number of species present at the time of sampling.

## 2.2 Sample Collection Requirements

- a.   Compositing of samples is to be conducted by a qualified third-party laboratory and not by the sampler.
- b.   When testing for mercury and/or histamines is not required, collect up to twelve samples (500 grams from each separate lot code) as described above from among the Primary Product Forms of finished products that are in the active inventory at the processing plant at the time of the audit. If testing is required for mercury and/or histamines, 750-gram samples must be collected.
- c. For Seafood Processing Plants that also process aquaculture species, please refer to PI Interpretation Guidelines - Sampling &amp; Testing Requirement - Aquaculture - Issue 2.0. Additional samples shall be collected for aquaculture/farm raised species under separate instructions.
- d.   Aseptic sampling protocols shall be followed at all times.
- e.   Sampling shall be conducted in accordance with SPS ANNEX 4, A4\_1.0-3.0 and Table I.
- f. Samplers shall organize and obtain equipment necessary to conduct the sampling: thermocool boxes, sterile polyethylene bags (confirm with the assigned laboratory concerning their standard procedures, as they may refuse the sample if improper packaging procedures are used), heat-sealing machines (normally available at the facility), and permanent markers (do not attempt to use stickers, as they may not stick properly to sample bags).
- g.   DO NOT USE permanent markers that may contain prohibited dyes utilized in aquaculture (example black Sharpie markers) to identify the alphanumeric codes on sample bags.
- h.   Samplers shall organize the traceability/chain of custody information related to samples that will be collected and document these details.
- i.    Samplers shall inform the lab of the expected date and time for delivery of samples - especially if it is out of normal business hours for the lab, so that they can make arrangement to store the samples accordingly.
- j. Samples shall be packaged in an outer package containing only individual samples from  a single species.

## 3.0 Laboratory Testing Instructions

- a. Testing laboratories must be accredited to ISO 17025.
- b. Compositing of samples is allowed given the following conditions:
- i. Compositing is to be conducted by a qualified third-party laboratory and not by  the sampler.
- ii. Before compositing is done, samples shall be split so there will be reserve portions of each sample available in case follow-up breakout testing for one or more parameters  is required.
- iii. No more than 4 samples can be combined into a single composite.
- iv. No  compositing  between  aquaculture  (farm  raised)  products  and  wild-caught  fishery products is allowed.
- v. Mixing species or primary product forms within a composite is NOT allowed for microbiological tests.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- c. Testing shall be in accordance with SPS ANNEX 4 Tables I, II, IV.
- d. Laboratories shall conduct 3 sets of microbiological tests for each set of 12 samples  submitted.
- e. Laboratories shall conduct 1 Methyl Mercury test on each susceptible species present.
- f. Laboratories shall conduct 1 Histamine test on each susceptible species present.

Example 3 - Laboratory testing determinations for wild-caught species:

The testing laboratory receives 12 individual samples for product testing as indicated in above example Solution 2a.

| Species        |   Number of Samples | Product Forms    |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| King Mackerel  |                   4 | Cold smoked      |
| Yellowfin Tuna |                   4 | RTE Frozen Sushi |
| Blue Mussel    |                   4 | Marinated frozen |

## Microbiological Testing (ANNEX 4 Table II):

King Mackerel - Test 1 composite of 4 samples

Yellowfin Tuna - Test 1 composite of 4 samples

Blue Mussel - Test 1 composite of 4 samples

 Test 3 composites of 4 samples each (1 set of tests for each species)

## Residue Testing (ANNEX 4 Table IV):

Methyl Mercury - Susceptible species includes King Mackerel only:

-  Test 1 composite 4 samples

Histamine - Susceptible species includes King Mackerel and Yellowfin Tuna:

-  Test 2 composites of 4 samples each (1 test for each species)

## 4.0 Detections

## 4.1 Microbiological Detections

A detection on a composite requires breakout testing (of individual samples) only if the result exceeds GSABAP Action Levels (SPS ANNEX 4 Table II). E. coli and Staphylococcus results showing detections but not exceeding GSA-BAP Action Levels are to be reported as detections and not failures for that composite.

## 4.2 Residue Detections

A residue detection on a composite that is proportionately capable of exceeding GSA-BAP Action Levels specified in SPS ANNEX 4 Table IV shall be broken out into individual samples (using the reserve portions of the associated sample lots) for confirmatory testing to determine which sample production lot(s) may be adulterated. Table 4 provides BAP guidelines for laboratories to use for breakout testing when a composite detection is obtained.  NOTE:  Table 4 is to be used as a guideline only and may not be applicable at very low Action Levels (i.e. table values may be below the sensitivity capability of the testing equipment).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

In the event  that  breakout  testing  is  conducted,  ONLY  THE  SAMPLES  IN  THE  COMPOSITE PRODUCING THE DETECTION SHALL BE RETESTED (USING THE RESERVE PORTIONS), AND ONLY FOR THOSE PARAMETER(s) THAT RESULTED IN A POSITIVE DETECTION.

Table 4 . BAP Guidelines for determining whether a residue composite detection should be broken out into individual samples for retesting.

GSA-BAP Action Levels (ppm)

|                         | Mercury              | Histamine            |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Samples  per  composite | 0.5                  | 50.0                 |
| Samples  per  composite | Breakout Value (ppm) | Breakout Value (ppm) |
| 2                       | 0.30                 | 30.0                 |
| 3                       | 0.20                 | 20.0                 |
| 4                       | 0.15                 | 15.0                 |

Example 4 - Determination of breakout testing for a composite detection:

The testing laboratory conducts residue tests per SPS ANNEX 4 on a composite consisting of 4 individual samples. Results indicate a positive detection for Methyl Mercury at any value ≥ 0.15 ppm. Per SPS ANNEX 4, the GSA-BAP Action Level for Methyl Mercury is listed as 0.5 ppm. Using the guideline in Table 4, any value ≥ 0.15 ppm (15 mg/kg) would initiate individual breakout of the composite,  and  the  4  samples  that  comprise  the  composite  should  be  retested  individually  for Methyl Mercury.

## 5.0 Failures

## 5.1 Microbiological Test Failures

- a. Individual samples testing above the GSA-BAP Action Levels in SPS ANNEX 4 Table II are considered a Failed  Test Result.
- b. Any composite testing above GSA-BAP Action Levels for Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., or Listeria monocytogenes stated in SPS ANNEX 4 Table II, requires immediate notification by the testing laboratory to the overseeing Certification Body and GSA-BAP. All potential violative sample production lots shall be identified within the notification. Once the notification has been established,  the  laboratory  shall  proceed  with  confirmatory  testing  on  individual  samples comprised in the composite of detection for the Microbiological Criteria detected to determine the violative sample production lot(s).

## 5.2 Contaminant Failures

- a. A Contaminant Detection on an individual sample testing above the 'GSA-BAP Action Level' value listed in SPS ANNEX 4 Table IV is considered a Failed Test Result.
- b. A Contaminant Detection that is above the Testing Laboratory's LOQ, but below the  'GSABAP Action Levels' value listed in SPS ANNEX 4 Table IV is considered a 'Detection'.

## Guidance to Meeting BAP Farm Standard 3.0 FIFO Requirements for Black Tiger Shrimp

## Purpose:

Among the requirements for farms that will in the future apply for certification under the new BAP Farm Standard Issue 3.0 are updated limits for Fish-In Fish-Out (FIFO) ratios.  Under the Finfish and Crustacean Farm Standard (FCFS) Issue 2.4, the limit for Penaeus monodon (black tiger shrimp) was set at 1.7, and under the new Farm Standard (FS) Issue 3.0, which will become mandatory on 1 March 2022, the limit for Penaeus monodon has been set at 1.2.

Guidance  is  needed  to  clarify  how  audits  are  to  be  conducted  under  these  updated  requirements,  and  the explanations below provide the rationale that is to be used, and the FIFO limits that are to be applied.  The FIFO limits to be applied are summarized in Table 1 at the end of this document.

## Rationale:

- · 2021 (FCFS): Farms audited in 2021 will be audited to the requirements of FCFS 2.4.  Auditors will review data from crops completed in 2020 (the previous calendar year), and the FCFS 2.4 FIFO limit of 1.70 is to be applied.
- · 2022 (FCFS): Farms that submit applications for certification or recertification prior to 1 March 2022 will be audited under FCFS 2.4.  Auditors will review data from crops completed in 2021 (the previous calendar year, and the FCFS 2.4 FIFO limit of 1.70 is to be applied.
- · 2022 (FS): Farms submitting applications after 1 March 2022 are required to apply under FS 3.0.   Completed applications received after 1 March 2022 under FCFS 2.4 will not be accepted.  But since it is understood that the data auditors will review is records for crops completed during previous calendar year (2021), prior to when the new FIFO requirements became mandatory, the FCFS 2.4 FIFO limit of 1.70 is to be applied.
- · 2023 (FS): Farms submitting applications at any time during 2023 are required to apply under FS 3.0.  Auditors will review data from crops completed in 2022.  Some crop cycles will likely have been stocked in 2021 (prior to the introduction of the new limits) and harvested in 2022, and for this reason a transitional FIFO limit of 1.45 is to be applied for all 2023 audits.
- · 2024 (FS): Farms submitting applications at any time during 2024 are required to apply under Farm Standard 3.0.  Auditors will review data from crops completed in 2023 (the previous calendar year), and the new FIFO limit of 1.20 is to be applied for all 2024 audits.

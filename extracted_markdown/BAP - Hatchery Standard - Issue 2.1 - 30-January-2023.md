## A. Summary of Key Changes from Issue 1.0 to 2.1

- 1. Hatcheries  are  now  required  to  conduct  a  risk  assessment  of  potential  human  food  safety  risks associated with their operations.
- 2. The worker safety and employee relations requirements have been updated, including requirements for wages and benefits, working hours including overtime, voluntary labor, child labor and young workers, use of workers from recruitment agencies, discrimination, disciplinary procedures, worker voice, and worker health and safety.
- 3. The effluent monitoring parameters and limits for land-based systems have been updated and include unique parameters and limits for recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).
- 4. The water quality monitoring requirements for cages or net pens in fresh or brackish water have been revised, consistent with the approach adopted in the BAP Farm Standard 3.0.
- 5. The BAP Fish In Fish Out (FIFO) limits for hatcheries using over 50 mt dry feed/year have been revised, and a requirement to calculate the Forage Fish Dependency Ratio (FFDR) has been added.
- 6. Requirements for live feeds produced in hatchery operations have been added.
- 7. Hatcheries are required to control the sources of their broodstock/eggs/etc. (stocking material) via an effective internal auditing process.
- 8. Requirements to limit escape events were updated.
- 9. Traceability requirements, particularly those related to demonstrating BAP Star Status, were updated, and trace-forward and trace-back exercise are now required .
- 10. 'Outsourcing activity' to an uncertified 'downstream' hatchery/nursery phase, as was considered in the introduction  to  BAP  Hatchery  Standard  2.0,  will  not  be  allowed  under  the  certification  process  of hatcheries.  The stage of the seedstock supply chain immediately preceding transfer of live aquatic products to a farm must be certified for the hatchery-related Star to transfer through to a BAP-certified farm.

## B. Introduction

## Best Aquaculture Practices Certification

The following Best Aquaculture Practices Standards apply to all aquaculture hatchery and nursery facilities that produce eggs and/or juvenile aquatic animals for live transfer to other aquaculture facilities and to all species for which BAP farm standards are available. Production facilities can be ponds or tanks on land with directed inflows and outflows of water, trays located intertidally on the foreshore, or rafts or net pens (cages) floating in a body of water. For the purposes of this standard, 'hatchery' or 'hatcheries' will be the generic terms used to describe such facilities.' Throughout this document the term 'hatchery' also includes nursery. In the case of multi-phase hatchery operations under a single company's ownership, depending upon the physical locations of facilities and other factors, the scope of the annual third-party audit may be limited to the final phase of production preceding transfer or sale of live aquatic products to a farm where the animals are grown to harvestable size for human consumption.  Other affiliated 'upstream,' production operations must be internally audited under the full scope of the BAP Hatchery and Nursery Standard.

Processes that may occur within the general scope of hatchery operations include:

- · Broodstock acquisition, production, selection, and management
- · Mollusk spawning and larval setting
- · Egg collection, fertilization, incubation, and hatching
- · Larval rearing
- · Feeds and feeding practices
- · A nursery phase or intermediate juvenile production phase before final grow out that may itself consist of one or more stages
- · Treatment of animals to induce sterility, manipulate gender or achieve protective immunity against pathogens, or to treat or protect  against disease.

Except in the case of certain mollusk species, the collection and rearing of eggs, larvae, or juveniles from the wild to supply as stocking material in farms is not permitted under these standards.

The above processes may be carried out in sequence at one location or in multiple locations with live aquatic products transferred between them, and ownership of the products may be changed in the case of supply chains that are not vertically integrated. For facilities with multiple locations, each location shall be considered a separate facility for BAP certification.

Some requirements may only apply to specific production systems (e.g., earthen pond facilities, facilities that produce effluents, or facilities using net pens). Each section of the standard and guideline identifies which specific standards apply to the different production systems.

For  understanding  the  certification  process,  please  review  the  information  available  on  the  GSA  website (https://www.bapcertification.org/WhatWeDo). A  decision  tree  outlining  the  rationale  to  be  used  in determining what production unit must be certified to achieve the BAP hatchery-related 'Star' will be posted alongside the hatchery Standard on the  Standards page on the GSA website.  If there is any uncertainty concerning these requirements, BAP's Program Integrity department may be contacted for guidance.

## Multi-Phase Hatchery Related Definitions

## Broodstock / Maturation Facility

- a. The terms 'broodstock' or 'maturation' facility is characterized as a location where broodstock populations  are  kept.    Broodstock  may  also  be  referred  to  as  parent  stock  or  founder  stock. Broodstock populations often incorporate genetic improved programs through selective breeding to improve disease resistance, growth, feed conversion, etc. Such facilities may supply customers juvenile or adult broodstock animals as is the case with shrimp, or they may supply customers 'eyed eggs' or juvenile fish as in the case of salmonids (parr or smolt) or fry, fingerling, etc. in the case of other species.
- b. A Nucleus Breeding Center (NBC) is a specialized type of broodstock facility typically far removed geographically  from  other  phases  of  'hatchery'  operations.    NBCs  maintain  a  high  degree  of biosecurity, including strict quarantine procedures, to avoid the introduction and/or dissemination of diseases and may ship eggs, nauplii and/or mature broodstock to all parts, or specific regions of the world.  Examples of NBCs include SPF shrimp broodstock (e.g., Hawaii, Florida), SPR shrimp broodstock (e.g., Ecuador), salmon and trout broodstock (e.g. Norway, USA), and tilapia (Malaysia, Philippines, Brazil, etc.).

## Hatchery

The term 'hatchery' has evolved over time and refers to different types of facilities performing different phases of production over the entire hatchery and nursery cycle.  Characteristics of such operations are described below:

- a. Traditional  Hatchery:  These  facilities  have  at  least  two  and  sometimes  three  of  the  following phases:
- -Maturation (breeding)
- -Incubation and hatching
- -Eggs and fry or fingerlings for fish (or nauplii, larvae and post larvae for shrimp) are grown to commercially-accepted stages for transfer or sale to nursery and/or grow-out facilities.
- b. Larval Rearing Facility:  Fish egg and fry (or nauplii for shrimp) are grown to commercially-accepted stages for transfer or sale to nursery and/or grow-out facilities.
- c. Hatch House:  A term used to describe hatchery production systems located within a farm facility where eggs (example: trout or tilapia eggs brought to farms from breeding centers) are hatched, typically in incubators, and then the fry/larvae are reared in varying production units to a size suitable for stocking at the farm or for transfer or sale to other nearby farms.

## Nursery

Facility where fish fry or salmon smolts or shrimp post larvae are grown to an intermediate size prior to transfer or sale to a grow-out facilities where the animals are grown until final harvest size for the market.

## Multi-phase Hatchery Production

The above operations may be located at a single site or in multiple locations.  Sites can be geographically distant from one another but to be considered 'multi-phase' under BAP certification, they would have to be under the same ownership.

## BAP-Multi Star Claim

The BAP program recognizes product from associated or integrated facilities with a 'star-based' ranking system.  Star  status  is  assigned  when  the  processing  plant  and  associated  farm(s)  have  attained certification, a 2-star designation. Associated hatcheries and feed mills attain BAP certification to reach the 3-star or highest 4-star designation.

## C. Standard Requirements - Food Safety

## A. General Requirements - All Production Systems

- 1.1 Hatcheries shall conduct an assessment that identifies potential food safety risks. The hatchery shall develop a management plan that describes procedures to prevent, monitor and control those risks and provide evidence that the plan is operational and effective.

## Implementation

Perhaps the best framework for the Food Safety Risk Assessment is the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system for management of food safety risks that is commonly used in seafood processing plants. A hatchery level HACCP plan would identify, evaluate, and control the food safety risks that occur during production. Such a plan would meet the requirements of this audit clause. The plan must address hazard analysis, critical control point (CCP) identification, establishing critical limits, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, verification procedures, and  record-keeping  and  documentation.  The  individual responsible for performing monitoring, corrective actions, verification procedures and record-keeping must be identified.

## B. Chemical and Drug Management - All Production Systems

- 1.2: The  facility's  Health  Management  Plan  (HMP)  shall  describe  protocols  for  all  drug,  chemical,  or hormone treatments.  Such treatments shall only be used in accordance with instructions on product labels, with adherence to all applicable local and national regulations, and only under the oversight of a licensed veterinarian or Aquatic Animal Health Professional (AAHP).  Off-label use of drugs shall only be done with the approval and guidance of a qualified veterinarian or AAHP.
- A list of therapeutics and other approved substances used by the facility shall be available.
- 1.3: Records shall be maintained for every application of drugs or other chemicals used for approved treatments, or during transport of live animals.  These records shall include the date, the compound used,  the  approving  veterinarian  or  AAHP,  the  dose,  and  the  date  on  which  the  animals  were transferred to another facility and the name of that facility. If the animals were harvested for human consumption, records of compliance with required drug withdrawal times shall also be maintained in addition to the residue levels complying to the country where the harvested products are sold.
- 1.4: When vaccines or anesthetics are used, records shall be available to ensure compliance in the facility's HMP. The use of vaccines or anesthetics shall be in accordance with manufacturers' instructions and with the approval of a qualified veterinarian or AAHP.
- 1.5: Antibiotics or chemicals that are prohibited in producing or importing countries shall not be used in feeds, pond additives, or for any other treatment.
- 1.6: For hatcheries using feed provided by non-BAP-certified sources, statements shall be obtained from feed  manufacturers  attesting  to  the  application  of  production  procedures  that  exclude  prohibited drugs,  proteinaceous  by-products  from  the  same  species  as  those  reared  in  the  applicant's hatchery/nursery, unsafe levels of heavy metals or other contaminants, and that are in compliance with the requirements for the countries of production and sale of hatchery animals.
- 1.7: Where toxicant-based antifouling agents are used on net-pen/cage nets, documents shall be available to  demonstrate that their usage is in accordance with local and national regulations. Net-cleaning procedures that allow the collection, treatment, and disposal of wash water shall be in compliance with local and national regulations.
- 1.8: Antibiotics,  antimicrobials,  or  hormones  shall  not  be  used  as  growth  promoters.  Eubiotics  are considered acceptable for use as growth promoters unless otherwise prohibited by local or national regulations. Records of all applications shall be available.
- 1.9: If hormones are used for sex reversal of animals, documents shall show that such use is not prohibited in the country of production. Records of hormone application shall be available for at least two years. Workers shall be trained in the safe handling of hormones and use of personal protective equipment, including gloves and masks with air filters.
- 1.10:  The hatchery/nursery shall have a written procedure and appropriate systems/amenities for treating any water used in the hormonal sex reversal of aquatic animals. If government standards exist for the discharge  of  hormone-treated  water,  the  hatchery/nursery  shall  conform  to  such  standards  and maintain records of approval and usage.
- 1.11:  If chemicals are used for the induction of triploidy in mollusks, only approved substances shall be used, and only according to manufacturers' instructions and existing  local and national  regulation. Records shall be kept of any such treatments.

## Implementation

Prohibited  antibiotics,  drugs,  and  other  chemical  compounds  must  not  be  used.  Approved  therapeutic substances must be used as directed on product labels for the treatment or under the guidance of a locally licensed veterinarian. These substances must be used for control and prevention of diseases, and not for haphazard prophylactic purposes without veterinary oversight.

Good health management focuses on the prevention of disease rather than disease treatment with chemical compounds. Methods by which disease prevention can be achieved include avoiding stocking diseased animals, the adoption of fallowing and 'all in, all out' stocking procedures, and maintenance of good water quality in culture systems. In some cases, water quality management can involve pretreatment of water, such as ultraviolet sterilization, before it flows through culture systems.

Disease  prevention  may  require  the  use  of  vaccines,  including  autogenous  vaccines  under  veterinary supervision, if these are available and thought to be effective against diseases known to be a threat to the cultured species. Where effective, vaccines should be applied to aquatic seedstock prior to known risks of exposure, such as when they are stocked in ponds or shipped to grow-out facilities. and procedures to be followed  when  the  treatment  is  complete,  including  verification  of  efficacy  and  the  application  of  any required withdrawal times.

## Treatment with Antimicrobial Agents

Health Management Plans must explain the steps to be taken when a diagnosed disease will be treated with approved chemicals and procedures to be followed when the treatment is complete, including verification of efficacy and the application of any required withdrawal times. Lists of approved chemicals can usually

be obtained from government regulatory authorities, seafood processing plants, government health and agricultural agencies, or university aquaculture or fisheries research and extension programs.

Chapter 6.2 of the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code describes the principles for responsible and prudent use of antimicrobial agents. Responsible and prudent use:

- · Maintains  the  efficacy  of  antimicrobial  agents  both  for  veterinary  and  human  medicine  and  to ensure the rational use of antimicrobials in aquatic animals with the purpose of optimizing both their efficacy and safety.
- · Complies with the ethical obligation and economic need to keep aquatic animals in good health.
- · Prevents or reduces the transfer of both resistant microorganisms and resistance determinants from aquatic animals to humans and terrestrial animals.
- · Prevents antimicrobial residues that exceed the established maximum residue limit (MRL) occurring in the food.

Article 6.2.7 of the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code describes the responsibilities of veterinarians and other aquatic animal health professionals. These include:

- · Identification, prevention, and treatment of aquatic animal diseases, as well as the promotion of sound animal husbandry methods, hygiene procedures, vaccination, and other alternative strategies to minimize the need for antimicrobial use in aquatic animals.
- · Prescription, dispensation, or administration of a specific course of treatment with an antimicrobial agent for aquatic animals under their care.
- · Carrying  out  a  thorough  clinical  assessment  of  the  aquatic  animal(s),  including  as  appropriate: clinical examination, post-mortem examination, bacteriology with culture and sensitivity, and other laboratory tests to arrive at the most definitive diagnosis possible before initiating a specific course of treatment with an antimicrobial agent.
- · Evaluation of environmental factors and husbandry at the production site (e.g., water quality) should be considered as potential primary factors leading to infection and should be addressed prior to prescribing a course of antimicrobial agent treatment.

If  therapy  with  an  antimicrobial  agent  is  deemed  necessary,  it  should  be  initiated  as  soon  as  possible. Selection of the agent shall be based on the knowledge and experience of a veterinarian or a recognized AAHP authorized to prescribe veterinary medicines. Timely application of sensitivity testing of the target microorganism shall be used to confirm the choice of treatment. The veterinarian or AAHP shall indicate precisely  the  treatment  regime:  dosage,  method  of  application,  treatment  intervals,  duration  of  the treatment,  any  required  withdrawal  period  and  the  quantity  of  antimicrobial  agents  to  be  delivered, depending on the dosage and the number of aquatic animals to be treated.

Antimicrobial  agents  must  only  be  used  on  the  prescription  of  a  veterinarian  or  a  recognized  AAHP. Hatcheries must ensure that antimicrobial agents are properly stored, handled, and disposed of. Treatments should  not  be  withheld  from  aquatic  animals  to  preserve  certification.  If  disease  outbreaks  occur  and treatments are required to maintain good welfare for the aquatic animals, these should be provided.

The  Health  Management  Plan,  and  specifically  disease  treatments  with  antimicrobial  agents,  must  be overseen by a veterinarian or a recognized AAHP. Recognizing that such expertise is not always available nearby, hatchery owners should endeavor to secure the services of experts or consultants with training, experience and expertise in aquatic animal health.

## Prohibited Antimicrobial Agents

Chloramphenicol  and  nitrofuran  antibiotics  are  proactively  prohibited  for  use  in  food  production  in  all countries. Other drugs and chemicals, such as antibiotics, malachite green, heavy metals, parasiticides and

hormones, may be proactively prohibited in specific countries. Hatcheries must have lists of antimicrobial agents prohibited for use in the country where production occurs as well as in the country or countries representing the primary markets for farmed aquatic animals. The recordkeeping system and inspection of drug  storage  containers  must  demonstrate  that  prohibited  antimicrobial  agents  are  not  in  use  at  the hatchery/nursery.

## Hormone Use for Sex Reversal

Employees who work with methyl-testosterone or other sex-reversal hormones must be trained in the safe handling of such hormones and be required to wear personal protective equipment, including gloves and masks with air filters. The hatchery must have an established protocol for managing effluent water used for sex reversal to prevent the release of hormone-treated water directly into the environment, and comply with government standards, where these exist.

## Chemical Use in Transport

Aquatic animals may be transported at any life stage, typically from hatcheries or nurseries to grow-out facilities. Chemicals used in transport may include sedatives/anesthetics/tranquilizers to reduce aquatic animal metabolic rate, salts for enhanced osmoregulation and handling stress reduction, oxygen-producing chemicals (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), pH buffering chemicals, ammonia control chemicals (e.g., zeolite), and antifoaming agents to improve visibility to allow better observation of aquatic animals. Antimicrobial agents shall not be used during transport from hatchery to nursery/grow-out facility. All chemicals used during transport  must  be  approved  by  regulatory  authorities  for  application  to  aquatic  animals.  A  list  of  such approved chemicals shall be available at the hatchery.

Participating hatcheries have  the responsibility to obtain all necessary  documentation  for  siting, constructing, and operating their facilities. Assistance in  determining these  necessary permits and licenses can  be  sought  from  governmental  agencies  responsible  for  agriculture,  environmental  protection,  fisheries, aquaculture,  water management  and transportation, as well as from local aquaculture associations.

A hatchery representative must provide all necessary documents to the auditor prior to or during the audit. Hatcheries  must  be  in  compliance  with the  requirements  stipulated  by  the  documents  provided.  For example, if a hatchery has an effluent discharge permit with water quality standards, those standards are enforced. In cases where governmental agencies have waived one or more permits, proof of these waivers must be available.

## B. Local Community Relations - All Production Systems

Hatcheries must strive for good community relations and not block access to public areas, common land, fishing grounds or other traditional natural resources used by the local communities.

- 2.4: The hatchery shall accommodate local inhabitants by not blocking traditional access routes to fishing grounds, wetland areas and other public  resources.
- 2.5: The hatchery shall manage water usage to avoid restricting the amount of water available to other users.
- 2.6: The hatchery shall demonstrate interactions with the local community to avoid or resolve complaints or  conflicts  through  meetings,  committees,  correspondence,  service  projects  or  other  activities performed at least annually.
- 2.7: The hatchery shall demonstrate efforts to mitigate any negative impacts on local communities and the surrounding environment including but not limited to: waste disposal, sensory impacts (visual, noise, and odor), and livelihoods of local residents.

## Implementation

## Access to Public Resources

Hatchery management must accommodate traditional uses of coastal resources through a cooperative attitude toward established local interests and environmental stewardship. Hatcheries must not block legal, traditional access corridors to public mangrove areas and public fishing grounds. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide a designated access route across the hatchery/nursery.

## Hatchery Appearance

Hatcheries  must  maintain  a  clean  and  organized  appearance,  absent  of  debris  and  garbage,  to  avoid becoming  an  eyesore  to  local  residents.  Machinery  should  be  maintained  in  good  repair  to  avoid unnecessary noises that may disturb  neighbors.

Compliance with this standard is verified through the examination of maps that may define public and private zones;  on-site  inspection  of  fences,  canals  and  other  barriers,  and  interviews  with  local  people  and hatchery/nursery workers.

## Community Engagement

Hatcheries must make a good-faith effort to have at least one face-to-face meeting annually with community representatives or with the community at large in an open meeting. Evidence of the effort to hold community meetings  can  include posters advertising a meeting, email messages  to  community  leaders  or representatives,  posts  on  social  media  platforms  and  meeting  minutes.  Other  evidence  of  community engagement or in-kind  contributions  can  include  invoices,  receipts,  signed  declarations  of  donations  or contributions to community events, construction of facilities (e.g., a playground), timesheet records of staff volunteering time at community events (e.g., replanting of mangroves), records of the applicant's initiative towards engagement. Hatcheries are encouraged to contribute to the provision of facilities such as access roads, schools, community centers and other tangible and intangible contributions to community cohesion and building social capital. Local community members should have the opportunity and a mechanism or procedure to register complaints.

## Implementation

## Worker Rights and Employee Relations

At  a  minimum,  hatcheries  must  provide  legal  wages,  a  safe  working  environment  and  adequate  living conditions. Hatcheries must take into account national regulations and local standards to comply with this aspect. Efforts should be made to exceed the minimum requirements, because certified hatcheries should be progressive and socially responsible.

Hatcheries  must  comply  with  local  and  national  labor  laws,  including  those  related  to  young  workers, overtime pay and compensation, worker safety, and where applicable, on-site living conditions. Hatcheries must take into account national and local regulations, however, if the law differs from a requirement in this standard, the provision that provides the greatest protection to the worker applies. Recommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO) should be used as a normative reference when local and national legislation  regarding  worker/employee  safety,  wellbeing  and  rights  is  not  sufficiently  comprehensive  in comparison.

Hatcheries  must  demonstrate  compliance  through  worker  contracts,  documented  method  of  payment, timesheets, disciplinary records, and piece rate records, among others. Hatcheries must maintain policies

related  to  working  hours,  benefits,  anti-discrimination,  and  remediation  for  anyone  identified  as  a  child worker.  In  addition,  hatcheries  should  maintain  thorough  records  regarding  their  labor  supply  chains including recruitment agency agreements, any fees paid by the worker, and the legal status of each worker. Age documentation for every worker should also be maintained and available at the time of the onsite audit. When  hiring  foreign  workers,  hatcheries  must  have  documentation  of  legal  status.  Records  must  be maintained of all  disciplinary  actions,  worker  grievances  and  mediation.  Records  of  disciplinary  actions should document the date, time, personnel involved, evidence reviewed, and disciplinary action taken, and corrective  actions  to  address  the  issue.  Workers  should  sign  the  record  to  indicate  awareness.  These records must be available to the auditor.

The principal of equal opportunity must be adhered to throughout this section of the Standard. All records of recruitment, compensation, benefits, access to training, promotion and termination must be disaggregated (separated) by sex. Men and women must receive equal pay for similar tasks.

Living  quarters  must  be  well  ventilated  and  have  adequate  shower  and  toilet  facilities.    Meals,  where provided for workers, be wholesome, with food storage and preparation done in a responsible manner. Trash and garbage must not accumulate in living, food preparation or dining areas.

## Worker Health and Safety

Workers must be provided with:

- · Knowledge and skills needed to do their work safely and avoid creating hazards that could place themselves or others at risk.
- · Awareness and understanding of workplace hazards and how to identify, report, and control them.
- · Specialized training, when their work involves unique hazards.

Staff and workers must be given initial orientation training as new workers as well as refresher training on safety in all areas of hatchery operations. Hatcheries must take the approach that workers have a 'right to know'  about  worker  safety  and  hazardous  conditions  associated  with  employment.  Training  programs should  be  accurate,  credible,  clear  and  practical.  Training  materials  should  be  prepared  by  qualified individuals and updated as needed. Trainers should have a general safety background or have practical experience in safety or be a subject matter expert. Training programs must be clear and presented in terms understandable by workers. Training programs should be useful to workers, with demonstrated application on the hatchery.

Workers must be trained in first  aid  for  electrical  shock,  profuse  bleeding,  drowning  and  other  possible medical emergencies. A plan must be available for obtaining medical assistance for injured or ill workers. Training must be provided on response to natural disasters such as severe floods and tropical cyclones.

Safety equipment such as goggles, gloves, hard hats, life jackets and ear protection, shall be provided when appropriate. Machinery shall have protective guards or covers where appropriate, and electrical devices must be correctly and safely wired. Tractors should have roll bars, shields over power take-offs and other appropriate safety devices. Use of personal protective gear and equipment should align with local conditions and local  dress  customs.  However,  these  conditions  and  customs  should  not  preclude  use  of  personal protective gear when the job or task requires their use.

Hatcheries that use divers to clear sludge from pond bottoms or perform other underwater tasks must develop a written Dive Safety Plan to assure safety and require directly employed or contracted divers to follow  the  plan.  The  plan  must  include  specialized  diver  safety  training,  maintenance  records  for  diving equipment and procedures for diving emergencies.

## E. Standard Requirements - Environmental Responsibility

## A. Protection of Ecologically Sensitive Areas - All Production Systems

Hatcheries must protect  and conserve ecologically sensitive areas  with  environmental attributes worthy of retention or  special care.  Wetland  areas  removed  for  allowed purposes must be mitigated.

- 3.1: Where the site plan shows that an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) has been damaged by hatchery construction and/or operation since 1999, such  loss shall only have been for allowable activities and purposes (installation of inlet and outlet canals, pump stations  and docks).
- 3.2: If net loss of ecologically sensitive area occurred on hatchery property since 1999, the loss shall have been mitigated by restoring an area three times as large or by an equivalent donation to restoration projects.
- 3.3: For  hatcheries  constructed  before  1999  and  where  an  ESA  was  damaged  but  not  restored,  the hatchery shall propose a plan, subject to local regulations, that within five years from the date of initial BAP certification shall restore the damaged area, mitigate the damage by restoring an equal area of similar habitat or make a donation of equivalent value to other restoration projects.  Evidence of the facility's compliance with the mitigation plan shall be provided.
- 3.4: Operation of the hatchery shall not lead to erosion, beach deterioration, or cause other ecosystem damage.
- 3.5: Unless allowed under specific regulatory permits, hatchery activities shall not alter the hydrological conditions  of  the  surrounding  watershed, and the normal flow of brackish water to mangroves or freshwater to wetlands shall not be altered.

## Implementation

These  BAP  standards  seek  to  prevent  damage,  if  possible, or mitigate damage where prevention is not possible.  In  all  cases,  hatcheries  must  employ appropriate construction  methods  and  methods  of operation to protect the natural resources  they use.

Construction and operation of new hatcheries or nurseries must not result in the loss of critical habitat. Critical habitat, as defined by the International Finance Corporation (2012), is 'any area of the planet with high biodiversity conservation significance based on the existence of habitat of significant importance to critically  endangered  or  endangered  species,  restricted  range  or  endemic  species,  globally  significant concentrations of migratory and/or congregatory species, highly threatened and/or unique ecosystems and key evolutionary processes.' Critical habitat for species classified as Endangered or Critically Endangered according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or any species on the list by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora shall not be lost by construction and operation of new facilities. New facilities shall not be constructed in legally protected areas, particularly IUCN Protected Area Categories I through IV.

Ecologically sensitive areas must be identified and protected during construction.

- · Hatcheries designed and operated to prevent erosion or sedimentation due to effluent discharge, water flow or flooding.
- · If hatchery operation requires access to water across an ecologically sensitive area, this shall only be  allowed  for  the  installation  of  inlet  and  outlet  canals,  pump stations and  docks.    Legal authorizations  required  for  construction  and  operation  of  such  infrastructure  shall  be documented.
- · ESAs damaged by construction or operations since 1999 must be mitigated by restoration of an area of similar habitat three times the size of the area damaged or by a donation of equivalent value to other restoration projects. This practice is only allowable if local regulations  permit.
- · In cases where ESAs were damaged before 1999, the hatchery must be the subject of a five-year restoration or mitigation plan.

## B. Effluent Monitoring and Management-  Land-Based  Systems  including Recirculating Aquaculture Systems

Hatcheries must monitor the concentrations and/or impacts of the metabolic wastes and uneaten feed discharged from their facilities and comply with BAP effluent quality criteria, unless they qualify for one of the specific exemptions provided in the standard. Hatcheries must also meet conditions for discharge as specified in their operating permits.

## Effluent Compliance Options

- 3.6: The average annual concentration of each effluent water quality parameter shall comply with BAP Water Quality Criteria (Appendix B) or applicable local and national regulations, whichever is stricter.
- NOTE: For each variable measured monthly, at least 10 of the values obtained during a 12-month period shall comply with the criteria, provided the 12-month average of the monthly data remains below the BAP limit for each variable. For variables measured quarterly, only one deviation is permitted for each variable during a 12-month/4 quarter period, provided the average of the quarterly data remains below the BAP limit for each variable. When such deviations occur, facilities should make every effort to correct the problems within 90 days.
- 3.7 During the annual inspection process, auditors shall witness effluent sampling and preparation for analysis by an independent laboratory. The samples collected during the audit shall be analyzed by a private or government laboratory following generally accepted analytical methods, and results shall conform to the limits stated in Appendix B.
- 3.8: In cases where the source water for a hatchery has individual water quality variables that exceed limits established as BAP Effluent Water Quality Criteria, hatcheries will be considered compliant as long as concentrations of those variables reflect no deterioration between intake and discharge of the relevant variable.  For  variables  of  source  water  that  do  not  exceed  BAP  Effluent  Water  Quality  Criteria, compliance with these effluent criteria is required. Reports of source water quality variables shall be available.

## Effluent Compliance Exemptions

- 3.9 Hatcheries operating with an average water exchange rate of &lt;1.0% of production system volume per day on an annual basis shall be exempt from BAP Effluent Water Quality monitoring.  Hatcheries seeking such an exemption shall provide documentary evidence to validate the exemption.
- 3.10:  Hatcheries that release no effluent to natural water bodies, or whose effluent is exclusively destined to irrigate agricultural crops, discharged into deep injection wells, or disposed into percolation ponds, are exempt from BAP Effluent Water Quality monitoring.  Hatcheries seeking such an exemption shall provide documentary evidence to justify their claims.
- 3.11:  Hatcheries that produce less than 5 mt of live aquatic pr oducts or use ≤5 mt of compound feeds per year are exempt from BAP Effluent Water Quality monitoring.  Hatcheries seeking such an exemption shall provide documentary evidence of the quantities claimed.

## Water Use

- 3.12:  The hatchery shall provide the auditor with an estimated annual water use during the last calendar year, as illustrated in Appendix C, and shall provide documentary evidence of how the estimate was derived.

## Effluent  Monitoring  and  Management  -  Land-Based  Systems  including  Recirculating  Aquaculture Systems

Hatcheries and nurseries must demonstrate that effluent of good quality, as defined by the BAP Effluent Water  Quality  Criteria,  is  discharged  to  receiving  waters.  The  water  quality  criteria  also  assure  that  the effluents from hatcheries have no greater concentrations of pollutants than typically allowed for effluents from other point sources. To confirm compliance with BAP water quality criteria at hatcheries, the auditor will review the written effluent sampling and analysis protocols used by the hatchery, and, during the audit process, witness effluent sampling and dispatch for analysis by an independent laboratory. Sampling and testing protocols must conform to the guidelines outlined in Appendix B. Routine sampling and testing may be performed by an independent laboratory, or by the hatchery Itself, provided that in both cases, tests conform to standard methods as published by the American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association and Water Environment Federation, or other equivalent international standards. Any inhouse water quality laboratories will be inspected during an audit.

At least 3 months of effluent data are required for initial hatchery certification, including those variables that are to be recorded quarterly.

In recognition of the diversity of production system types and intensities, this standard provides several options and exemptions to achieve conformity. These options should demonstrate that application of good management practices is effective in reducing the volume and improving the quality of hatchery effluents.

## Source Water Quality

Some  hatcheries  may  use  surface  waters  from  streams,  rivers,  lakes  or  estuaries  as  source  water  for production.  On  occasion,  the  concentration  of  some  of  the  water  quality  variables  in  the  source  water exceeds the limits for effluents as defined in the BAP Effluent Water Quality Criteria. For those variables, hatcheries can demonstrate that there is no deterioration in water quality between intake and discharge points.  Specifically,  hatcheries  can  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  increase  in  concentrations  of  total suspended solids, soluble phosphorus, total ammonia-nitrogen, 5-d biochemical oxygen demand and no decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration. This option does not apply to pH and chloride concentration. For those variables that do not exceed BAP Effluent Water Quality Criteria in source water, compliance with these criteria is expected and required. To demonstrate no deterioration in water quality between and intake

and discharge, water quality variables of both source water and effluent must be measured and records maintained. Samples must be collected according to the frequencies stated in Appendix B.

## Low Water Exchange Rate Systems

The  mass  discharge  of  nutrients  and  organic  matter  from  hatcheries  or  nurseries  is  the  product  of concentration  multiplied  by  effluent  volume.  As  a  practical  matter,  it  is  much  easier  to  reduce  mass discharge by reducing effluent volume. In recognition of this, an exemption to meeting BAP Effluent Water Quality Criteria is established for hatcheries that limit the volume of effluent discharged. Hatcheries and/or nurseries that qualify for this exemption shall demonstrate water reuse, only occasional water exchange and no intentional discharge of effluents into natural water bodies during production, such that less than 1% of the culture water volume is exchanged daily on an annual basis and effluent is discharged to a receiving watershed.

An estimate of the total water volume used in production of aquatic animals shall be reported. Records indicating the volume of effluent discharged must be available. Hatcheries qualifying for this exemption are nevertheless  required  to  report  an  annual  effluent  discharge  volume.  An  estimation  of  annual  effluent volume, water use, and nutrient load indices must be determined as described in Appendix A. Hatchery intake water volume must be recorded monthly.

## Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS)

The  BAP  effluent  water  quality  limits  were  originally  established  for  flow-through  aquaculture  systems. Concentrations of effluent parameters in such systems, due to their high rates of exchange, are considerably diluted, resulting in the low concentrations typically observed.  In contrast, when hatchery facilities operate under  a  recirculating  model  of  water  management,  such  that  90%  or  more  of  their  total  water  flow  is recirculated on a daily basis, dissolved nutrients such as Total Phosphorus or Nitrate-N have a tendency to become concentrated in the recirculated water, resulting in a reduced volume effluent stream containing more concentrated levels of nutrients.  Several factors may influence this: the degree to which facilities recirculate  the  water  in  their  production  system,  the  biomass  of  animals  in  the  system,  the  nutritional characteristics  of  the  feeds  used,  the  total  water  volume  of  the  production  system,  and  other  design specifications of the culture system.  It is generally true however that the overall load of nutrients to the receiving environment is significantly reduced by the use of recirculating systems vs. flow-through systems. Recirculating hatchery facilities that can be classified as 'limited-exchange systems' are exempted from meeting the limits described in the BAP effluent monitoring requirements (&gt;99% recirculation on average).

When such conditions are identified, aerobic benthic  conditions  shall  be  restored  by  fallowing  or  other  means.  Records  of  inspection  and restoration shall be available.

## Implementation

## Production Practices for Cages and Net Pens in Fresh or Brackish Water

The best way to reduce nutrient outputs from cage and net pen culture is to increase the efficiency of feed use (i.e.,  reduce  FCR).  Hatcheries  must  use  feed  manufactured  by  a  reputable  feed  mill  and  meet  the nutritional needs and presented in a form (i.e., pellet size) that is suitable for each particular life stage of the aquatic animal. The feed should contain ingredients of high digestibility and contain no more nitrogen and phosphorus than necessary.

Feed shall be provided at a frequency and duration to maximize efficiency. Hatchery personnel responsible for  feeding  should  assure  that  fish  consume  all  feed  offered.  Fish  should  have  access  to  the  feed  for sufficient time so that it is consumed before feed is lost through the cage or pen mesh. Feeding rings that retain floating feed should be used in low-volume (&lt;25 m 3 ) cages. Feeding rates should be monitored to avoid overfeeding. Observations of fish feeding activity are facilitated by using floating feed for certain species.

It  is  currently  not  practical  to  collect  and  treat  wastes  from  cages  and  net  pens.  The  main  precaution against pollution is to locate culture units in open-water areas where water currents are sufficiently high to transport wastes away from cages and rapidly mix and dilute wastes.

High fish biomass in a particular location can increase the likelihood of pollution. In bodies of water that stratify  thermally,  a  high  fish  biomass  can  result  in  severe  organic  enrichment  and  dissolved  oxygen depletion in the bottom water layer (hypolimnion). Subsequent sudden thermal destratification, a naturally occurring  process,  can  result  in  dissolved  oxygen  depletion  throughout  the  water  column.  This phenomenon has been responsible for serious fish mortality of caged fish as well as wild fish populations

outside cages. Although there are no specific guidelines for the biomass that can be safely sustained at a particular cage site, monitoring shall be used to track the status of water quality and anticipate the need to take action in the event of sudden destratification.

## Water Quality Limits

Cages  and  net  pens  may  be  installed  in  lakes,  reservoirs,  rivers,  streams,  irrigation  systems,  ponds, estuaries and embayments. Uneaten feed, feces and metabolic excretions of aquatic animals enter directly into the water bodies that contain the cages or net pens. The release of these wastes, derived from feeding, can cause enrichment (eutrophication) of the water bodies where hatcheries have installed cages. The potential of cage and net pen culture to cause eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs depends primarily on the total amount of feed added, location of production facilities relative to the water body outlet, the area and depth of the water body and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) or flushing rate of the water body. Nutrients and organic matter are removed from water bodies by outflow, and systems with short HRTs are less  likely  to  become  eutrophic  as  a  result  of  aquaculture  operations  than  systems  with  longer  HRTs. Collectively these factors affect the capacity of the water body to assimilate the wastes from feeding, often called the carrying capacity. Assimilation capacity is impractical to measure for purposes of aquaculture certification.

The approach used to demonstrate environmental responsibility with respect to the effects of feed-derived wastes released during cage and net-pen operations is water quality monitoring. Specifically, this standard sets limits for certain water quality variables that are indicative of a mesotrophic or intermediate state of eutrophication. In mesotrophic conditions, an extreme level of environmental enrichment is avoided. In mesotrophic waters, the risk of dissolved oxygen depletion is less than in eutrophic or hypereutrophic waters. Thus, a mesotrophic condition simultaneously limits the extent of environmental enrichment and protects aquatic animal welfare to enable conditions suitable for healthy animals, good growth and efficient feed  conversion.  The  water  quality  limits  provide  some  flexibility  because  each  water  body  responds uniquely. Furthermore, water quality in many water bodies varies seasonally (cold, warm / dry, rainy) and these water quality limits account for that variation. Natural water bodies can already be eutrophic when certification is sought. Sites at which water quality in the water body containing cages or net pens does not comply with BAP effluent guidelines shall not be eligible for certification.

Water samples must be collected once every two months for analysis of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration by standard laboratory methods. Samples must be collected within the lease or concession at a depth of 50 cm. Secchi disk visibility must be measured once every two weeks during clear weather and around mid-day. Dissolved oxygen concentration must be measured once monthly in the morning, between 0600 and 0900 h, at 50 cm depth. Appendix D has additional information on water sampling and analysis.

One of the typical consequences of eutrophication in water bodies used for cage or net-pen culture is a shift  in  the  composition  of  phytoplankton  communities  towards  species  that  are  tolerant  of  low  light intensities. Often these species can be broadly categorized as blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), which are undesirable because they are potentially toxic to fish or livestock, produce unsightly surface scums, and may cause off-flavor in farmed and wild fish. These algae typically appear in water of low transparency.

Once every two months, in water bodies with a Secchi disk visibility less than 5 m, a water sample must be collected at 50 cm depth and the percentage of blue-green or other potentially harmful algae assessed. There are numerous examples of suitable methodological approaches for sampling and enumeration of phytoplankton. One example is 'A Phytoplankton Methods  Manual for Australian Freshwaters' (http://phytobioimaging.unisalento.it/Portals/7/Documents/General\_Documentation/A%20Phytoplankto n%20Manual%20methods%20Australia.pdf).

Blue-green algae have a wide size variation, but the focus of sampling should be directed towards the relatively large-sized, scum-forming blue-green algae, including but not limited to representatives of the following genera: Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis and Planktothrix/Oscillatoria. Blue-green and

other algae must be enumerated to estimate relative community composition. Sub-samples can be used periodically to estimate algal biovolume by multiplying cell or colony counts by estimates of cell volume for the main species identified.

## Allowable Water Quality Changes

To assure that environmental quality is maintained at a level to support good aquatic animal welfare and mesotrophic conditions, hatcheries must evaluate changes in water quality that may anticipate reaching the water  quality  limits  established  in  3.13.  During  the  first  year  after  initial  certification,  an  independent laboratory must be contracted to establish a baseline of environmental quality. Specifically, the hatchery must have the laboratory measure concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration in samples collected from 50 cm depth within the lease or concession every two months. Hatcheries must measure baselines for Secchi disk visibility and minimum dissolved oxygen concentration. Measurements of Secchi disk visibility are to be done every two weeks and dissolved oxygen concentration monthly. In subsequent years, the monitoring program must proceed as outlined in 3.13. Changes in any water quality variable  greater  than  25%  of  the  value  of  the  baseline  will  be  considered  a  non-conformity  and  require corrective action, typically a reduction in fish biomass.

## Sediment Monitoring

Wastes can accumulate beneath cages and cause deterioration of sediment quality. This is environmentally undesirable and can have negative impacts on the welfare of fish in cages as well. Sediment quality in areas with fish cages can be protected by fallowing - periodically moving cages to new sites in a concession and allowing the sediment beneath the original sites to recover. Observations on sediment quality must be used to determine if and when to move cages.  For cages located in rivers or in reservoirs with extremely short HRT's (&lt;5 days), the restriction concerning location of cages where depths are &gt;10 m or where the reservoir depth is at least twice the depth of the cage, is not applicable.

Some freshwater lakes and reservoirs are normally stratified throughout the year, with a bottom layer of water with little or no oxygen. In such conditions, restoration of bottom condition is not possible or practical because the processes leading to anaerobic bottom waters are naturally occurring. In this case, hatcheries are  not  required  to  inspect  sediment.  However,  hatcheries  must  demonstrate  that  bottom  waters  are anaerobic with monthly sampling of dissolved oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion (bottom layer), with specification of the depth sampled. Hatcheries placed in locations with water depths greater than 30 m are exempt from sediment monitoring.

## D: Cages or Net Pens in Marine Water Above 25-ppt Salinity, Coastal RAS and Coastal FlowThrough Facilities

- 3.18:  The hatchery shall provide documents that describe local standards for benthic impacts under net pen facilities, which shall include the benthic indicator 'trigger level' above which the facility would not be in full compliance with the local standard.
- 3.19:  For established hatcheries, three years of monitoring data shall be available to show that the hatchery meets or exceeds sediment quality criteria specified in its operating permits and/or its own monitoring plan at current operating levels.
- 3.20:  Where sediment monitoring is not required as described above and/or where an allowed sediment impact zone is not defined, the hatchery shall document and implement a Sediment Monitoring Plan. The Plan shall incorporate:
- 3.20.1 Securing the services of an independent individual or company with demonstrated expertise in  sediment sampling and analysis to design a sediment sampling and analysis program appropriate  to  the  hatchery  conditions  and  to  conduct  sediment  monitoring  as  required below.
- 3.20.2 Establishing and mapping an allowable sediment impact zone that shall not exceed the total area of the hatchery plus a boundary zone of 40 m around it. The footprint may be shifted in any direction to account for normally occurring current patterns as long as the total area remains the same.
- 3.20.3 Monitoring  organic  matter  accumulation  on  the  seabed  within  this  zone  by  the  method deemed best  for  the  type  of  sediment  that  exists  there.  The  choice  of  method  shall  be justified by prior documentation of the type of sediments over which the hatchery is located.
- 3.20.4 Conducting sediment sampling to coincide with the period of peak sustained feeding during each crop cycle.
- 3.21:  Monitoring  of  sediment  conditions  shall  be  undertaken  at  the  time  of  peak  feeding  during  the production cycle and shall be conducted according to the requirements of the hatchery's operating permits or its own Sediment Monitoring Plan in countries or regions where sediment monitoring is not required, and as specified in the implementation guidance.
- 3.22: Sediment sampling and analysis performed as part of the monitoring program shall apply generally accepted international methods  and be adapted  to the local hydrographic or benthic  conditions.
- 3.23: Copies of sediment monitoring reports submitted to regulatory agencies shall be available, together with evidence of any remedial actions that were implemented  and  completed by the hatchery to remain in compliance with its operating permits.
- 3.24: Production cycles and fallowing shall be coordinated with other neighboring BAP applicants or BAPcertified facilities, or with members of an established Area Management Agreements (AMA).
- 3.25: Where an AMA has not been established, hatcheries shall nevertheless demonstrate cooperation on matters of stocking, fallowing, animal health and biosecurity with BAP-certified facilities within an area twice the regulatory minimum separation distance to an upper limit of a 5-km radius from the hatchery.

## Implementation

## Sediment Monitoring - Marine Net Pens/Cages, Coastal RAS and Coastal Flow-through Facilities

This section applies to net pens in marine and brackish water environments. It also applies to coastal RAS and  coastal  flow-through  hatcheries  that  operate  with  a  high  rate  of  water  exchange,  greater  than  one system volume exchange per hour.

## Specific Regional Standards

In some countries and regions, cage facilities are subject to specific regulations about benthic impacts, but in  other  places,  regulations  may  be  inadequate  or  non-existent.  This  standard  reinforces  any  existing regulations and describes minimum requirements where effective rules are not already in place.

Hatcheries  must  provide  documents  that  describe  local  standards  for  benthic  impacts  under  cages. Hatchery permits and/or local regulations usually define an allowed 'sediment impact zone,' 'allowable zone of effect' or 'footprint of deposition,' and prescribe monitoring protocols to evaluate this area. Because biological  sampling  of  sediments  (i.e.,  benthic  invertebrate  community  composition)  requires  special expertise and is time-consuming and expensive, chemical sediment properties are usually used as leading indicators of sediment condition. Biological sampling is only required in some jurisdictions if a chemical indicator trigger point is exceeded.

Production cycles and fallowing shall be coordinated with neighboring aquaculture facilities, whether or not they are BAP-certified, or with members of an established Area Management Agreement. Whole leases, not only bays with cages, should be fallowed for at least six months. BAP-certified hatcheries are encouraged to  make  a  good-faith  effort  to  participate  in  the  creation  and  implementation  of  Area  Management Agreements  to  address  cumulative  benthic  impacts  associated  with  multiple  facilities.  BAP-certified operations that operate in isolation should have a statement of intent to enter an AMA, if another operation moves into the area.

## Hydrographic and Benthic Characterization

Hatcheries utilizing cages facilities are usually located following a hydrographic, biological and physical study of the site to determine that operations will not have significant negative impacts on animal populations that comprise the benthos under or near the hatchery. Then 'allowable' benthic impacts are set as conditions in the operating permits for the hatchery, which are defined in terms of one or more of several chemical properties of the sediments. Sometimes these are then correlated with species density and diversity determinations that are based on prior knowledge of local sediment biology or analysis of sediment reference samples collected from the site.

## Sediment Monitoring Plan

Chemical  indicators  used  for sediment  monitoring  include  sediment  oxidation-reduction  potential; concentrations of dissolved oxygen, sulfide, total organic carbon or total volatile solids; or visual inspection with documentation by video. Certain variables are better suited to some environments than others. For example, sulfide determination works well in silt or clay sediments containing up to 50% sand, as does determination of total organic carbon. Above this level of sand, an indicator such as total organic carbon concentration works better. On hard bottoms with over 10% gravel, visual recording by video is best because grab sampling is impossible, and many such sea bottoms are erosional in nature, not depositional.

An existing hatchery must provide at least one production cycle of monitoring data to show that the hatchery meets  or  exceeds  benthic  standards  required  by  operating  permits  at  current  production  levels.  Newly established cage facilities (first production cycle) must have completed a baseline study, with review by an independent expert, that describes hydrographic and benthic conditions at the site, and that in the expert's opinion  (given  without  liability),  the  hatchery  can  meet  or  exceed  the  benthic  standards  required  by  its operating permits at current or proposed production levels. This opinion must be verified by reference to sampling results at the subsequent audit.

## Sediment Sampling and Analysis

Samples are taken along at least two transects that pass directly through the cages and align with the dominant flow of water at the cage site. One sample with three replicates must be taken at the edge of the cage site and another at the 25-m or 40-m boundary. Five replicate samples must also be taken from at least two reference stations within 1 km of the site that have similar depth and sediment characteristics as occur at the site and where there is no aquatic animal production.

Hatcheries  must  provide  documents  to  show  that  sediment  quality  was  determined  using  generally accepted sample collection and analytical methods. As different methods or combinations of methods may be required in different jurisdictions based on local hydrographic or benthic conditions, no preferred method is specified in this standard, only that whatever method is used must be undertaken using standard methods of sampling and analysis that conform to generally accepted international standards.

Hatcheries  must  demonstrate  by  statistical  analysis  of  the  results  that  there  is  no  organic  matter accumulation from hatchery activities at the boundary of the allowable sediment impact zone in comparison to the reference station, as determined by the monitoring method chosen.

## E: Soil and Water Conservation - Land Based Systems Only

Hatchery  and/or  nursery  construction and  operations  must not  cause soil and  water  salinization  or deplete groundwater in surrounding areas. Land-based hatcheries must properly manage and dispose of sediment from ponds, raceways, tanks, canals and settling basins.

## Land-Based Systems

- 3.26:  If ponds with brackish or saline water are constructed on permeable soil, management measures shall be taken to control seepage (e.g., use of pond liners) and avoid contamination of aquifers, lakes, streams and other natural bodies of freshwater.
- 3.27:  For  inland  brackish  and  saline  water  production  systems  operating  in  freshwater  areas,  quarterly monitoring of neighboring well and surface water shall show that chloride levels are not  increasing due to hatchery  operations.
- 3.28:  If groundwater sources are used for production purposes, data on water levels in neighboring wells shall be requested from the well owners, and where available shall show that the water table is not being adversely affected.
- 3.29:  Use of water from wells, lakes, streams, springs or other natural sources shall not restrict the amount of water available to other users or cause damage to ecologically sensitive areas or subsidence in surrounding areas.
- 3.30:  The hatchery shall process all sludge/sediment in sedimentation basins or by other proven sediment concentration  methods,  such  as  filters  and  presses,  and  shall  not  dump  material  in  ecologically sensitive areas.
- 3.31:  If  the  hatchery  uses  tanks,  raceways  or  similar  systems  with  short  retention  times,  sedimentation basin capacity shall be provided to handle the associated sludge/sediment, and documents shall be available to show how the capacity was calculated.
- 3.32:  Any  accumulated  sludge  removed  from  ponds,  tanks,  reservoirs  or  sedimentation  basins  shall  be confined  within  the  hatchery  property  until  it  is  properly  disposed  of.  Operations  should  favor utilization of sludge for agricultural production when feasible and practical.
- 3.33:  Removed sediment shall be properly contained and located to prevent the salinization of soil and groundwater  and  shall  not  be  placed  in  sensitive  locations  such  as  mangrove  habitats  or  other protected areas.
- 3.34:  The hatchery shall take mitigation measures to control erosion and other impacts caused by outfalls.

## Implementation

## Salinization

Salinization of freshwater bodies and/or aquifers can result from hatchery operations where saltwater or brackish water is used in production systems or is discharged into ponds for settlement prior to discharge. The risk of salinization can be reduced by not constructing settling  or treatment  ponds in highly permeable, sandy soil, or by providing clay or plastic liners to minimize seepage. Discharging into  ponds  where  the groundwater is already saline is another approach.  Other best practices include:

- · Not discharging saline water into freshwater areas.
- · Avoidance of pumping of groundwater from freshwater aquifers that significantly lowers the water table in neighboring  wells.
- · Where water is pumped from deep saline aquifers under freshwater aquifers, the well casing shall be properly cemented to prevent leakage of saltwater into overlying freshwater aquifers.
- · Monitoring of chloride concentration in freshwater wells near hatcheries to determine if salinization is occurring.

Use of water from irrigation systems shall be in accordance with regulations, and effluents shall be returned to the irrigation system.

## Sediment and Sludge Management

Most aquaculture ponds have long hydraulic retention times and solids generated during production from feeding will settle and to some extent be treated on the pond bottom. However, negative environmental impacts can arise when sediments are resuspended during harvest or when sediment is pumped from ponds during the culture period and discharged as a highly fluid sludge. The sludge contains organic material from feces, uneaten feed, and dead algae and mineral particles from source water, if rivers and streams are used, and scoured from embankments or resuspended from the pond bottom.

The first principles of sediment management on land-based aquaculture facilities are to prevent excessive sedimentation  through  good  management  practices  and  confine  sedimentation  to  specific  parts  of  the hatchery. Where supply water has a large sediment load, reservoirs for pre-sedimentation can remove much of the suspended material so it will not settle in water supply canals and production ponds.

Sediment accumulation in ponds and canals can be reduced by:

- · Implementing proper earthen infrastructure design and construction to reduce erosion by rainfall and water currents.
- · Placing aerators to avoid impingement of water currents on embankments that cause scouring.
- · Placing a layer of large stones (riprap) or other lining materials in erosion-prone areas.
- · Covering bare areas of embankments with gravel or grass.

Discharge of sludge may not be an issue for ponds with production of less than 20 mt/ha per crop, but above this threshold, sedimentation basins for sludge storage are needed. The minimum required sedimentation basin volume can be estimated using the following equation:

Sedimentation  basin  volume  =  37.5  x  [Fish  production  (mt)  ÷  Sludge  transfers  (times/crop)]  +  [Fish production (mt) ÷ 0.6]

In  this  equation,  fish  production  is  the  total  quantity  of  fish  produced  in  all  ponds  that  discharge  into  a sedimentation basin, and sludge transfers are the mean frequency at which sludge is moved from ponds to a sedimentation basin. It is also assumed that:

- · The minimum hydraulic retention time to allow coarse and medium solids to settle out is six hours.
- · One mt of fish production equates to 1 mt sediment.
- · Sludge removal can be spread over a 24-hour period.
- · Sediment bulk density is 0.6 t/m 3 .
- · The solids content of sludge is 6.5 kg/m 3 .
- · Accumulated sediments in the basin are removed at the end of each crop to return the basin to its original capacity.

If  sludge  is  removed  more  frequently  from  ponds,  the  required  size  of  the  sedimentation  basin  can  be reduced.

For hatcheries producing more than 20 mt/ha per crop, the hatchery shall provide the auditor with mean values for fish production and sludge transfer frequency so the required sedimentation basin volume can be calculated. The auditor will verify that the facility has the required volume of basins in use and available for sludge containment.  Basins should be configured so that raw sludge enters at the surface at one end of the basin and the resulting effluent exits at the surface at the other end of the basin. Five or six calibrated poles should be installed in basins to allow the accumulation of settled solids to be monitored and ensure the available capacity can always support a minimum six-hour hydraulic retention time.

Raceways or  similar  flow-through  systems  have  short  retention  times,  and  in  high-intensity  operations, sediment loads can  often  exceed acceptable limits.  Therefore,  such  facilities  must  incorporate  suitably sized settling zones or other engineered solutions that assure removal of the majority of settleable solids. Accumulated solids must be pumped or siphoned periodically to offline sludge basins, where they can be dewatered and subsequently removed for use as fertilizer in land-based agriculture crops.

Any accumulated sludge removed from ponds, reservoirs or sedimentation basins shall be confined within the hatchery property or consolidated and used locally as fill material or for agriculture. Pond sediment from bank erosion can usually be reused to restore the slope of eroded pond embankments. Sludge or sediment shall  not  be  applied  to  sensitive  natural  wetlands  or  wetland  buffers.  On  large  hatcheries,  sediments removed by dredging shall discharge into offline containment areas within the hatchery property rather than directly into streams or other estuarine areas. These can be installed along the margins of canals or on areas of salt flats above high tide. When sediment is stored, it shall be confined within a diked area so that solids resuspended by rainfall can be retained. The sediment can also be spread in a thin layer over the land and vegetative  cover  established.  If  dredged  accumulated  sediment  is  disposed  of  outside  water-holding structures,  care  shall  be  exercised  to  prevent  the  formation  of  spoil  piles  that  can  cause  ecological disruption through erosion and transport to surrounding areas.

## F: Responsible Feed Use - All Production Systems

Hatcheries  shall accurately monitor feed inputs and take  steps  to minimize  potential  risks  of contamination or spoilage. Hatcheries that produce juvenile animals with average live weights over 5 g and use more than 50 mt of dry feed yearly shall minimize the use of fishmeal and fish oil derived from wild fisheries.

## All Production Systems

- 3.35:  Accurate records shall be documented and maintained for all feeds used, their sources, and quality control tests undertaken to detect the presence of contaminants or toxicants.
- 3.36:  Live,  fresh  or  frozen  feed  for  juveniles  and  broodstock  brought  into  the  hatchery  from  an  outside source shall be accompanied by a written record from the supplier warranting that the feed is fresh or was frozen when fresh and has not been treated with toxic preservatives such as formalin.
- 3.37:  To retain quality and freshness, all feed shall be stored under cover in compliance with manufacturer's recommendations with enough space from the walls provided to allow ventilation and movement for inspection.
- 3.38:  Feeds and feed additives (premixes) shall be protected from moisture and fouling pests, and stored separately, from fuels, chemicals and other potential  contaminants.
- 3.39:  Biosecurity  provisions  for  feeds  brought  into  or  produced  at  the  hatchery  shall  be  followed  as described in the Health Management Plan. Documented records shall be available to demonstrate this.
- 3.40:  The hatchery shall obtain written assurance from the feed manufacturer that the feed does not contain aquatic  feed  protein  from  the  same  genus  as  the  species  being  produced.  However,  protein hydrolysates verified to &lt;10,000 Daltons are permissible.

## Hatcheries Producing Juveniles With Average Weight &gt;5g and Using Over 50 mt Dry Feed/Year

- 3.41:  The hatchery shall use feed for which the manufacturer has provided data on the inclusion rate (%) in feeds of total fishmeal, fishmeal from byproducts, fish oil, and fish oil from byproducts. The hatchery shall obtain a written declaration from the feed manufacturer that it maintains records on the species and fishery origins of each batch of fishmeal and fish oil.
- 3.42:  The hatchery shall record the characteristics of all feeds used, the total amounts of each feed used each year, and the total annual crustacean or fish production.
- 3.43:  The hatchery shall calculate and record a feed-conversion ratio for each completed production cycle.
- 3.44: The hatchery shall calculate and record a final Fish-in Fish-out (FIFO) ratio and Forage Fish Dependency Ratio (FFDR) value for all completed production cycles.
- 3.45:  The  FIFO  shall  not  exceed  4  (or  5  if  fish  processing  byproducts  are  included  in  the  feed). Note: no FFDR limits have yet been set for the Hatchery Standard.
- 3.46:  The hatchery shall obtain feed either from a BAP-certified feed mill or from a feed mill that provides declarations that it complies with the BAP Feed Mill Standard's requirements for responsible sourcing of marine ingredients (current version), specifically:
- · The recording of species and fishery origins of each batch of fishmeal and fish oil, and;
- · Having a written Plan of Action defining policies for responsibly sourcing fishmeal and fish oil from reduction fisheries and setting clear goals for responsibly sourcing soy ingredients.

## Hatcheries Producing Live Feeds

- 3.47:  Hatcheries that produce live feeds such as phytoplankton, copepods, rotifers, Artemia, etc., in-house shall have written procedures that define production methodologies, sanitary procedures for avoiding contamination  of  cultures,  disinfection  procedures,  harvesting  and  concentrating  and  feeding processes to ensure optimal use of such feeds, shall train staff responsible for live feed production, and shall have appropriate infrastructure, equipment, and supplies to optimize production of such live feed products.

## Implementation

Hatcheries  shall  keep  accurate  records  of  all  feed  brought into and used at the facilities.  Management shall take all reasonable measures to ensure the feed is wholesome and stored under conditions  where it will not deteriorate.  Biosecurity  issues related to live, fresh, or frozen feeds brought into the facility or live feeds  produced  at  the  facility  shall  be  the  subject  of  measures  outlined  in  the  site-specific  Health Management Plan (HMP). Because of the extremely small early life stages in some aquaculture species, it has been necessary for many hatcheries to produce live feeds, in place of purchasing formulated dry feeds, at least for early feeding stages. Hatcheries that rely upon in-house production of live feeds must develop and implement written procedures for optimizing production of nutritious, healthy live feeds for their culture animals.

Hatcheries  that  use  more  than  50mt  of  dry  feeds  yearly and produce juveniles of over 5 g average live weight shall maintain records that enable FIFO and FFDR values to be calculated  as described  in Appendix F .

To promote the responsible sourcing of marine ingredients, the hatchery shall  obtain  feed  from  a  BAPcertified  feed mill or a feed mill that declares and documents compliance with responsible sourcing criteria

of the BAP Feed Mill Standards. These standards address sourcing policies on marine ingredients, covering traceability  for  species  and  origin,  and  the  exclusion  of  any  species  designated  on  the  IUCN  Redlist  as endangered or critically  endangered.

Aquaculture producers shall strive to use marine feed ingredients efficiently, relative to current industry standards, as well as in the global context of livestock feeds and the different species and system intensity combinations. The fish-in  fish-out  (FIFO)  ratio  and  forage  fish  dependency  ratio  (FFDR)  are  two  related indices of the ecological efficiency of fishmeal and fish oil use in an aquaculture system. In short, FIFO considers  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  together  and  FFDR  considers  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  separately.  Many aquaculture feeds incorporate only small amounts of fishmeal and fish oil and farms that use these feeds can have FIFO and FFDR values less than 1, indicating that they make a net contribution to global fish supplies.

Farms  shall  obtain  documentation  concerning  the  percent  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  in  feeds  from  feed manufacturers or suppliers. The inclusion levels in feeds shall include any meal or oil derived from whole, wild-caught fish, squid, krill, mollusks or any other wild aquatic animals. However, they shall exclude meal or oil derived from by-products such as trimmings, offal and their derivatives such as squid liver powder, aquaculture by-products such as shrimp head meal and ingredients derived from invasive aquatic species. The quantity of each feed type used, along with the fishmeal and fish oil content of each feed shall be recorded in the audit report.

## G: Stocking Sources and GMOs - All Production Systems

Certified hatcheries shall comply with government regulations regarding the use of native and non-native species,  genetically  modified  aquaculture  species  and  wild-caught  broodstock.  Except  for  certain molluscan shellfish, wild caught juveniles shall not be collected, stocked, or supplied to growout farms.

- 3.48:  The hatchery shall maintain accurate records of the species produced and, where relevant, any significant stock characteristics,  including but not limited to non-native, specific pathogen-free, specific pathogenresistant, sterile, hybrid, triploid, sex-reversed  or genetically  modified  (bioengineered)  status.  Records shall also include documentation to support the stock characteristic claims made.
- 3.49:  If government regulations control the use or importation of any of the species or stocks produced, relevant permits shall be made available for inspection, even if imported eggs, juveniles or fry were purchased from an intermediary entity.
- 3.50:  The hatchery shall keep records of sources and purchases of stocking material, and document the number stocked in each culture unit for each production lot. Numbers shall be determined either by physical count or by estimation using batch weight and average individual animal weight, with records available that also include an estimated margin of error.
- 3.51:  The hatchery shall comply with all government regulations regarding importation of native and nonnative gametes, juveniles, and  broodstock, where applicable.
- 3.52: The hatchery shall not source and stock wild juveniles to supply to growout farms. The collection of seed of certain wild mollusks is allowed and when practiced by the hatchery, such collection and stocking shall comply with applicable regulations.
- 3.53:  Hatcheries  shall  avoid  utilizing  wild  populations  as  a  continuous  supply  of  broodstock,  except  as necessary to improve genetic diversity as documented in the hatchery's Genetic Improvement Plan (GIP). If wild-caught broodstock are used, documents from the appropriate government agency shall be available to show their capture was approved, and the broodstock were caught from regulated and sustainable fisheries, where such information is available.
- 3.54:  Where the species produced is neither native nor already approved for farming, further documentation shall  be  provided  to  demonstrate  that  approval  for  farming  is  based  on  the  2005  ICES  Codes  of Practice on the Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms or, for freshwater species, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's 1988 Codes of Practice and Manual of Procedures for Consideration of Introduction and Transfers of Marine and Freshwater Organisms.
- 3.55:  Hatcheries  that  engage  in  genetic  improvement  of  stock  through  selective  breeding  shall  have  a written Genetic Improvement Plan (GIP) that describes improvement goals and how genetic fitness will be maintained as these goals are pursued.
- 3.56:  The hatchery shall demonstrate effective control over any non-BAP-certified suppliers of broodstock, eggs, smolt/fry/juveniles/post larvae, spat or any other stocking material. Control measures at nonBAP-certified suppliers shall include either annual audits by a hatchery's own internal auditors to the full scope of the BAP Hatchery and Nursery Standard, or third-party certification against the Standard. Records of all control measures shall be available.

## Recordkeeping

From  the  standpoint  of  product  traceability,  at  the  hatchery  level,  records  of  purchases  or  transfers  of stocking  material  are  the  fundamental  first  step.  For  each  production  unit  (pond,  tank,  cage)  and  each production cycle, comprehensive records about the source, broodstock or seed attributes and characteristics, number stocked, and number surviving shall be maintained. The list of examples of species characteristics given in the audit clause is not exhaustive, and there may be other relevant characteristics that should be noted. For example, some aquatic animal seed batches may have been vaccinated or treated with chemicals as disease prophylaxis prior to stocking. The flow of aquatic animal seed through the facility as the animals grow, including transfers among production units, shall be tracked with the recordkeeping system. Facilities shall demonstrate that populations of aquatic animals in a production unit can be traced back to their sources at any time while the animals are being grown. A sample Traceability Form that records such data is provided in Appendix E.

## Importation Permits

During an audit, documentation of compliance with government regulations (i.e., permits) relating to the importation  of  aquatic  animal  broodstock  and  any  associated  health  certificates  shall  be  available  for review. The hatchery shall demonstrate awareness of the relevant national and local laws and regulations regarding  introductions  and  transfers  of  live  aquatic  animals.  The  hatchery  shall  establish  a  link  to  the domestic competent authority (veterinary health authority or other government regulatory body) to verify international importation requirements and follow the International Health Certificate protocol defined by

the OIE. Government regulations differ by country and the certification body is not expected to maintain complete records  of  the  requirements  in  every  country.  However,  auditors  should  become  familiar  with relevant  regulations  and  importation  procedures  in  countries  where  they  regularly  perform  audits. Hatcheries  importing  a  new  species  for  the  first  time  should  be  scrutinized  with  extra  vigilance  to demonstrate that legal channels were followed.

Hatcheries that engage in genetic improvement of stock through selective breeding shall have a written Genetic  Improvement  Plan  (GIP)  that  describes  improvement  goals  and  how  genetic  fitness  will  be determined, monitored, and maintained as these goals are pursued. Guidance on the development of such a plan is available through FAO. (See references in Additional Information below.)

## Non-native Species

Many non-native species are a major segment of productive aquaculture sectors in many countries. Tilapia have been spread to many countries outside native ranges in Africa and the Middle East. White shrimp have been introduced from the Americas to many countries in Asia. For intentional introductions of non-native species, hatcheries shall demonstrate regulatory approval that is based on the 2005 ICES Code of Practice on Introductions of Marine Organisms or the Codes of Practice and Manual of Procedures for Consideration of Introduction and Transfers of Marine and Freshwater Organisms (FAO 1988). A non-native species is considered established if it has a reproducing population within the watershed, as inferred from multiple discoveries  of  adult  and  juvenile  life  stages  over  at  least  two  consecutive  years.  Given  that  successful establishment may require multiple introductions, species are not considered established if their records of discoveries  are  based  on  only  one  or  a  few  non-reproducing  individuals  whose  occurrence  may  reflect merely transient species or unsuccessful invasions. To reduce the potential deleterious impact of escapes, technologies such as sterility, ploidy and monosex production are encouraged.

## Genetically Modified or Bioengineered Organisms

Bioengineered (BE) organisms, otherwise also referred to in some jurisdictions as Genetically Modified Organisms  (GMOs)  or  transgenic  organisms  are  defined  as  organisms  that  have  been  genetically modified  by  artificial  transfer  of  genetic  material  from  another  species.  Sterile  or  sex-reversed organisms and their subsequent offspring, and organisms created by hybridization and polyploidy are not GMOs. Should genetically modified fish or crustaceans be commercialized in the future, producers shall  comply with all regulations in producing and consuming countries regarding such organisms. Information regarding the BE status of harvested aquatic animals must be transferred from the farm to processing plants or other buyers that receive those animals.

## H: Control of Escapes - All Production Systems, Several Standards for Net pens Only

Certified  hatcheries  shall  take  measures  to  minimize escapes and unintended releases of the facilities' stocks.

## All Production Systems

- 3.57:  A site risk analysis, updated after every production cycle, shall identify the potential and actual causes of escapes, determine the relative likelihood of their occurrence or recurrence, and identify critical control points for effective escape risk monitoring, reduction, and response.
- 3.58:  Employees shall be trained in the findings of the risk analyses, and the efficacy of procedures in place to monitor and reduce escape risks, and effectively respond to all actual and suspected escape events for broodstock, eggs, and juveniles. Training records shall be available.
- 3.59:  If it is determined that an escape event has occurred, it must be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities immediately with supporting documentation.
- 3.60:  All holding, harvest, stock transfer, transport, and culture systems shall be designed, operated and maintained to minimize the unintended release of eggs, larval forms, juveniles and adult animals.
- 3.61:  Screens,  nets  or  other  controls  sized  to  retain  the  smallest  live  aquatic  animals  present  shall  be installed on water outlet pumps,  pipes or sluices.
- 3.62:  Screens, nets or other controls shall be installed around pump intakes to minimize the introduction of local aquatic fauna.
- 3.63:  All screens shall be well-maintained and checked for damage at least daily. Screens on larval rearing systems  that  are  not  changed  daily  shall  be  checked  during  cleaning  or  exchanges,  and  prior  to installation.
- 3.64:  Effluents  released  to  natural  water  bodies  shall  be  monitored  for  the  presence  of  live  cultured organisms and records of such monitoring shall be available.

## Net pens

- 3.65:  The hatchery shall provide documentation demonstrating that the facility's moorings were installed according to the manufacturers or marine engineer's specifications.
- 3.66:  Based on the escape risk analysis, the hatchery shall have a written Stock Containment Plan (SCP) that  describes  how  net  pen  system  integrity  is  assured  and  maintained.  Unless  a  hatchery  can demonstrate by engineering  specifications,  operational  considerations,  or  government  regulations that alternative procedures provide equal or better safeguards against escapes, the criteria outlined in clauses 3.67 through 3.73 shall be followed.
- 3.67:  The hatchery shall provide documents to show that all staff members have received training in the Stock Containment Plan, which shall be verifiable by training certificates in workers' files and verified during the audit by interviews with a subset of workers.

- 3.69:  The ages of all nets at the facility shall be tracked, and strength tests shall be conducted on them every two years using a recognized net strength-testing method. (See Additional Information for an example.) Nets shall be retired when their strength is below 60% of the strength of new nets.
- 3.70:  All  operational  nets  shall  be  surface  checked  for  holes  daily  and  checked  subsurface  with  an underwater camera or by a diver at least weekly, weather permitting. Nets and cage superstructure shall be checked for holes and other indications of structural damage immediately after risk events such as cyclones or big tides when inspections can be safely conducted.
- 3.71:  Boats shall have protective guards on the propellers and staff members who operate the boats shall be trained to avoid contact between boats and cage nets.
- 3.72:  At marine sites, procedures, and equipment consistent with local Coast Guard (or equivalent) rules shall be in place to warn marine traffic of the facility's presence.
- 3.73:  The hatchery shall maintain equipment for the recapture of escapees and have written procedures for its use. The procedures must enable a rapid response, subject to legal constraints on the types of equipment used.

## Implementation

## Containment System Integrity

Avoiding breaches in containment leading to escapes of aquatic animals is in the economic interest of producers. It is also in the interest of minimizing environmental interactions between hatchery-reared and wild  organisms,  such  as  disease  transfer  and  changes  in  gene  frequency  in  wild  populations.  Thus, containment systems for any life stage shall be designed, constructed and operated to minimize the escape of culture animals. These containment systems can be used to grow, hold temporarily or transport cultured aquatic animals. Containment systems shall be designed and constructed using applicable standards or best practices.

The infrastructure and equipment used to contain aquatic animals shall be inspected according to a regular schedule.  A  program  shall  be  in  place  for  regular  preventative  maintenance  and  repair  of  containment infrastructure  and  equipment.  A  reporting  system  shall  be  in  place  to  indicate  inspection  results  and preventative maintenance undertaken .

## Screening

Screens and nets of a size to retain the smallest aquatic animals present shall be installed as a barrier between the culture unit and the environment. This applies to cages or net pens and outlets (pipes, gates, etc.) from land-based pond, tank or flow-through systems. Examples of acceptable filter devices include a series of mesh screens capable of screening all water, dry-bed filters constructed with gravel and sand, microscreen solids filters, and pond traps with screened discharge .

## Escape Detection and Incidence Response

All incidents involving animal escapes shall be accurately documented, including the reason for the escape, the  estimated  number  of  organisms  that  escaped,  the  health  status  of  the  escapes,  and  any  recovery plans/effectiveness statistics. If an escape is known or suspected to have occurred, the root cause shall be investigated immediately, the steps shall be taken to correct it, and plans and actions proposed to address future escape risks. These actions shall be documented in hatchery records. If, after investigation, there are grounds for believing an escape occurred, the remaining aquatic animals in the culture system shall be

counted, if and/or when water and welfare indicators indicate this can be done without causing excessive distress to the aquatic animals, and any loss of inventory shall be recorded.

## Net Pens

Every effort shall be made to assure that stocked animals do not escape from enclosures in water bodies. Cages and net pens shall be constructed of sturdy material and maintained in good condition to minimize the  likelihood  of  holes  and  rips  in  the  cage  mesh  through  which  animals  can  escape.  It  is  particularly important to use material that does not corrode, as holes can suddenly appear without warning in nets made of corrodible wire.

Cages and pens should be placed in areas where there is little danger of collisions with boats or floating debris and where heavy waves are not likely to damage them. Brightly colored buoys or navigation lights should be placed to mark location of cage arrays. Placement of cages and pens in navigable waters may need approval from governmental authorities. Divers or underwater cameras shall periodically inspect cages for holes, rips and tears.

## Containment Plan

Hatcheries or nurseries using cages or net pens shall have a written Stock Containment Plan (SCP) that covers escape prevention and deals with known or suspected escapes. The SCP shall include the following elements:

- · Integrity  of  Infrastructure  and  Equipment  -  design  and  construction  standards  for  an  effective containment system, equipment testing.
- · Inspections  -  inspection  program  for  infrastructure  and  equipment,  including  preventative maintenance program and repair.
- · Inventory Control Procedures - counting methodology and verification, aquatic animal inventory reconciliation.
- · Aquatic  Animal  Handling  Practices  -  precautions  during  transfers,  counting,  grading,  disease treatment, harvesting, transport and other hatchery operations.
- · Predator  Deterrence  and  Control  Plan  -  predator  control  structures  (as  appropriate),  control  of predator access, control methods.
- · Response Procedures and Escape Mitigation - recapture and recovery of stock, escape incident reporting requirements, root cause analysis of escapes or containment failure.
- · Recordkeeping  -  equipment  testing  results,  aquatic  animal  inventory  reconciliation  or  escape detection, escape event log, training activities.
- · Training - definition of employee responsibilities, oversight.

## Escape Prevention

- · Documents  shall  show  the  net  pen's  moorings  were  installed  according  to  the  manufacturer's and/or marine engineer's specifications.
- · A site risk analysis updated at least annually shall identify the potential and actual causes of fish escapes, determine their relative likelihood of occurrence or recurrence at the hatchery site, and identify  critical  control  points  for  effective  escape  risk  monitoring,  reduction  and  response  by hatchery staff.
- · Procedures based on the risk analysis shall include management protocols and actions designed to monitor escape risks, reduce them when identified and respond to escape events in a timely and effective manner. The efficacy of these measures shall be verified and documented through the year.
- · Procedures  shall  require  the  main  surface  components  of  the  system  to  be  inspected  at  least monthly and repaired or replaced as needed. The sub-surface components must be inspected and replaced as needed at least every six months or between each crop cycle, whichever is shorter. Equipment shall be replaced as needed.
- · Net inventory management procedures shall track the ages of all nets on the hatchery or in storage and provide strength tests on all nets between crops or every two years, whichever period is shorter. Nets shall be retired when their strength is below levels specified in local regulations or, where there are none, below the manufacturer's or supplier's recommendations.
- · Cage inspection procedures shall ensure all operational nets are surface checked for holes at least weekly and checked sub-surface at least every two weeks. Nets and cage superstructure shall be checked for holes and other indications of structural damage after risk events such as storms or big tides.
- · Predator deterrence procedures shall minimize the risk that predators can make holes in nets.
- · Boat equipment shall include guards on propellers and staff training procedures that minimize the risk of contact between boats and hatchery nets.
- · At marine sites, procedures and equipment consistent with local Coast Guard rules shall warn nonhatchery marine traffic of the hatchery's presence.
- · Procedures for handling live fish shall prevent 'spillage' during transfers.

## I:  Wildlife Interactions - All Production Systems, Several Standards for net pens Only)

Hatcheries  shall  manage  physical  interactions  with  wildlife  to  avoid  adverse  outcomes  and  employ humane, non- lethal measures for predator control where possible.

## All Production Systems

- 3.74:  The hatchery shall use humane methods of predator exclusion and deterrence, actively favor nonlethal control methods, and avoid lethal methods. Where applicable, government permits for predator control shall be made available for review.
- 3.75:  The hatchery shall maintain a list of species that occur within the vicinity of the hatchery that are classified as endangered or threatened under regional laws and/or the IUCN Red List.
- 3.76:  Only under exceptional circumstances, such as when there is risk to human life, shall controls other than non-lethal exclusion be applied to predator species. In cases where lethal controls are determined to be necessary, the hatchery shall ensure that specific members of staff have been designated and trained to carry out lethal control measures in a humane manner.
- 3.77:  The hatchery shall record the species and numbers of all avian, mammalian, and reptilian mortalities resulting from predator control  actions  and shall report  them as required by local authorities.

## Net Pens

- 3.78:  The hatchery shall provide a list of relevant local laws and specific conditions of operating permits that apply to wildlife management  and protection.
- 3.79:  Marine sites shall maintain maps that identify officially designated 'critical' and/or 'sensitive' marine and coastal habitat in the region. If the hatchery is in an area so designated, a list shall be included of the classified or endangered sedentary species within a 2-km radius of the hatchery and of mobile coastal  species  within  the  region.  The  list  shall  be  updated  where  necessary  to  show  wildlife established  after  the  hatchery  began  operations.  New  sites  shall  actively  avoid  areas  official designated as critical or sensitive marine habitats.
- 3.80:  Documents shall be available that describe the passive measures in place to deter the entry into net pens  of  would-be  predators  and  procedures  for  the  routine  inspection  and  maintenance  of  the measures.
- 3.81:  Documents  from  regulatory  authorities  shall  be  available  to  show  that  any  active  but  non-lethal deterrent  measures  used  have  been  approved  by  regulators,  following  a  review  of  environmental impacts  with  specific  reference  to  endangered,  protected  or  cetacean  species  in  the  area.  Such devices shall not be deployed if the review shows they can adversely affect these species.

## Implementation

The BAP program strongly encourages hatcheries to employ humane, non-lethal measures for predator and pest control, even when lethal methods are permitted. Additionally, all species  listed  as  'endangered'  and 'critically  endangered'  by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List or protected by local or national laws shall be subjected to passive deterrence methods only, and no active or lethal means shall be used except  under  exceptional circumstances, such as risk to human life.

## Wildlife Interaction Plan

Hatcheries shall have a written Wildlife Interaction Plan (WIP) that includes provisions stipulated in local laws and the hatcheries operating permits, as well as the following requirements, if not stipulated in local laws. Hatcheries that fully enclose culture units within a building or greenhouse that effectively exclude wildlife are exempt from the requirements of a WIP, other than meeting the required legal compliance. The hatchery  shall designate  an  individual in the hatchery  management  team  to  be  responsible  for implementation of the WIP. The WIP shall include but not be limited to the following elements:

- · A list of relevant local laws and specific conditions of the hatchery's operating permits that apply to wildlife management and protection and allowed wildlife deterrent measures.
- · A list  of  local  species  classified  as  endangered  or  threatened  under  local  laws  and/or  listed  as 'Critically Endangered' or 'Endangered' on the IUCN Red List.
- · A map that identifies officially designated 'critical' and/or 'sensitive' protected areas in the region and the location of any wildlife colonies or migratory corridors.
- · If the hatchery or nursery is in or near an area designated as critical or sensitive habitat, a list of endangered non-migratory species within a 2-km radius of the hatchery and of migratory species within the region, updated when necessary, as new habitat is designated.
- · A  recordkeeping  system  for  reporting  observations  of  endangered,  threatened  and  protected species.
- · Designation of workers or management staff responsible for implementing lethal control measures, if needed.
- · Description  of  the  hatchery's  passive  measures  (barriers)  to  deter  the  entry  of  predatory  birds, mammals or reptiles into production units (ponds, tanks, cages, etc.).
- · Procedures for regular inspections to evaluate and report on the integrity of culture units and the effectiveness of wildlife barriers.
- · At  marine  net  pen  sites  with  carnivorous  marine  mammals  (seals,  otters,  sea  lions,  orcas)  and predatory sharks, a description of the hatchery's passive measures (primary or secondary barriers) to protect net pens from underwater attack.
- · At marine net pen sites, the WIP shall include documentation to show that any acoustic harassment devices used are approved by regulators through a review of environmental impacts with specific reference to endangered, protected, threatened or cetacean species in the area. Such devices shall not be deployed if the review indicates they can adversely affect these species.
- · At marine net pen sites, the hatchery may only use acoustic harassment devices to control predators if independent  expert  opinion  verifies  that  their  use  will  not  harm  endangered,  protected  or threatened species or any cetaceans, and if they are legally approved and/or permitted for use.
- · Documentation that  any  active,  non-lethal  wildlife  deterrent  measures  used  by  the  hatchery  are approved by government regulators.
- · Reporting procedures in the event that control measures cause the accidental death of wildlife and proposed actions to prevent reoccurrence.
- · Procedures that state that legally approved lethal methods shall only be used after all non-lethal methods are attempted.
- · Prohibition of deliberate lethal controls on species classified as endangered  or  critically endangered, except under exceptional circumstances, such as risk to human life, and then only after specific written authorization is obtained from regulators.
- · Procedures for regulatory authorization, implementation and reporting of lethal control measures

when these are deemed necessary.

## Worker Training

The management staff member responsible for implementation of the WIP shall be responsible for training workers and other management staff on elements of the plan. Workers shall be trained in aspects of wildlife predator  deterrence  and  control  that  they  may  be  called  upon  to  implement.  Hatchery  workers  and management staff shall be trained to recognize, and report endangered, threatened and protected species observed on the hatchery. The individual designated to carry out lethal control measures shall be adequately trained to implement humane and effective lethal control methods.

## Predator Exclusion and Deterrence

Humane, non-lethal methods for exclusion and deterrence of wildlife predators is required. Hatcheries shall keep  records  to  demonstrate  that,  if  used,  a  wildlife  predator  exclusion  and  deterrence  program  is operational and effective. Hatchery site inspection during the audit will assess ongoing wildlife predator exclusion  and  deterrence  activities.  As  site  characteristics  and  conditions  vary  widely,  the  use  and effectiveness of various predator control methods will vary, and no single approach is likely to be effective. A  combination  of  approaches  is  encouraged,  and  an  empirical  approach  should  be  taken  to  evaluate effectiveness.  Compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  wildlife  (especially  threatened  and endangered species) and permitted predator deterrence methods is expected.

If humane, non-lethal methods for exclusion and deterrence of wildlife predators fails after every effort is made, then  attempts  should  be  made  to  capture,  remove,  and  relocate  the  potential  predator  from  the hatchery. In extreme cases, after all non-lethal methods are attempted, and especially when worker safety is  at  risk,  lethal  methods  can  be  considered.  Lethal  control  methods  must  only  be  those  allowed  by applicable national laws and regulations. Lethal methods must be rapid, safe, and done as humanely as possible. If firearms are used, they must be within the scope of government permits, and only weapons appropriate for the predator should be used.  Only properly trained workers licensed to use firearms shall be assigned  to  kill  such  predators,  and  any  mortalities  shall  be  documented  and  reported  properly.  Only predators actively engaged in an attack that endangers worker safety should be shot without a permit. No lethal predator controls can be used with species that are listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List or that are protected by local or national laws.

## Recordkeeping

The Wildlife Interaction Plan has a recordkeeping requirement for reporting observations of endangered, threatened  and  protected  species  on  the  hatchery.  Hatcheries  are  encouraged  to  be  transparent  with stakeholders in providing public access to these records. Hatcheries shall maintain a recordkeeping system that records the species and numbers of all avian, mammalian (except rodent pests) and reptilian mortalities associated with predator control efforts. It is not necessary to record mortalities of these species that are not caused by predator control efforts.

## J:  Storage, Disposal of Supplies and Wastes - All Production Systems

- 3.82:  Fuel, lubricants, feed and chemicals used at the hatchery shall be labeled, stored, used and disposed of in a safe and responsible manner. A list of such materials together with Material Safety Data Sheets for them shall be maintained and made available to the auditor.
- 3.83:  Chemicals used for hatchery operations shall be neutralized or diluted before discharge into natural bodies of water. Neutralization or dilution shall be in compliance with manufactures' recommendations and all local and national regulations.
- 3.84:  Fuel,  lubricants  and  agricultural  chemicals  shall  not  be  stored  near  feed,  in  employee  housing  or kitchen areas, or near harvest equipment and supplies.
- 3.85:  Fuel, lubricants and chemical storage areas shall be marked with warning signs and risk indicators.
- 3.86:  Precautions shall be taken to prevent spills, fires and explosions, and procedures and supplies shall be readily available to manage chemical and fuel spills or leaks. Designated staff shall be trained to manage such spills and leaks.
- 3.87:  Garbage  from  housing  and  food  waste  shall  be  retained  in  water-tight  receptacles  with  covers  to protect contents from insects,  rodents,  and other animals.
- 3.88:  Garbage  and  other  solid  waste  shall  be  disposed  of  to  comply  with  local  regulations  and  avoid environmental contamination and odor problems (e.g., recycling, burning, composting, or placing in a legal landfill).  All hatchery related trash shall be removed regularly and properly to avoid accumulation and under no circumstances be dumped into mangrove areas, wetland, or other vacant lands.
- 3.89:  Discarded hatchery supplies and equipment (e.g., tires, pallets, bags, barrels, aeration paddles or engines) shall be stored tidily and removed properly to avoid excessive accumulation.
- 3.90:  Measures shall be taken to prevent infestation by animal and insect vectors and pests.
- 3.91:  Secondary  fuel  containment  volume  shall  be  at  minimum  equivalent  to  the  total  fuel  container capacity plus 10%.
- 3.92:  Domestic sewage shall be treated and properly disposed of to avoid contamination of surrounding areas (e.g., sewer system, septic system, portable toilet or outhouse).

## Implementation

The  range  of  chemicals  and  supplies  used,  and  solid  wastes  generated  in  aquaculture  hatcheries  and nurseries is diverse, depending on type of culture system, production intensity and species grown. Release of those materials can compromise the food safety of farmed aquatic animals, environmental pollution, or the  spread  of  disease  pathogens.  Hatcheries  are  encouraged  to  develop  a  systematic  approach  to  the management of chemical and solid wastes in their particular production context. The goal of such a system should be to track the flow, generation and disposal of materials that result in waste and to reduce their volume.

## Safe Storage

Some  materials  used  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  aquaculture  hatcheries  represent  an environmental  risk  if  released  intentionally  or  inadvertently  to  the  environment.  Safe  storage  of  these materials is the initial barrier between the material and the environment.

Labels, risk indicators and warning signs should align with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and  Labelling  of  Chemicals  (GHS).  All  physical,  human  health  and  environmental  hazards  should  be identified and labeled as such. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) shall be available for all chemicals used on the hatchery. A chemical inventory shall be maintained. Chemicals shall be labeled with the date received and date opened.

Storage and containment facilities that are safe, secure, and properly designed, well ventilated and properly managed must be provided for all fuel, lubricants and agricultural chemicals used. Chemicals shall be stored in  secure  area  with  access  only  to  authorized  personnel.  Chemicals  shall  never  be  stored  on  the  floor. Materials  shall  be  segregated  by  hazard  class  and  according  to  compatibility  to  prevent  undesirable chemical  reactions  should  two  or  more  chemicals  accidently  mix.  Material  used  in  shelving  should  be compatible with the chemical being stored. Chemicals must not be stored in direct sunlight or near any heat source. Cylinders of compressed gases shall be secured properly such as by using chains and not using

breakable  materials  such  as  rope  or  raffia  string.  Highly  toxic  or  controlled  substances  and  veterinary medicines shall be stored in a locked cabinet. Secondary containment shall be provided for individual or multiple fuel storage tanks. The containment volume shall be equivalent to the total stored volume plus 10%.

Chemicals such as insecticides, herbicides, and algicides shall be stored in locked, well-ventilated watertight  buildings.  The  buildings'  concrete  floors  should  slope  to  a  center  basin  for  containing  spills.  Risk indicators and warning signs for these materials shall be posted.

Fertilizers, liming materials, salt and other less hazardous agricultural chemicals shall be stored under a roof, where rainfall will not wash them into surface water. Particular care shall be taken with nitrate fertilizers, which are strong oxidants that are particularly explosive when contaminated with diesel fuel or other oils.

- Oil leaks  from  tractors,  trucks  and  other  equipment  shall  be  prevented  through  regular  scheduled maintenance. Spills shall be avoided during oil changes and refueling of vehicles, generators and pump motors.  Used  oil  should  be  sent  to  a  recycling  or  aggregation  center.  Used  chemicals  and  leaking  or deteriorating containers shall be disposed of responsibly.

Procedures  shall  be  developed  for  managing  spills  of  chemicals  and  other  products,  and  the  supplies needed  for  cleaning  up  spills  shall  be  readily  available.  Workers  shall  be  trained  to  properly  use  the equipment and handle the contained waste. First aid supplies, emergency phone numbers, eyewash and emergency shower equipment, fire extinguishers, spill cleanup supplies and personal protective equipment shall be readily available, and workers trained in their use.

## Feed Storage

Feed represents the largest variable cost item in fed aquaculture. Thus, care must be taken to guard the quality of feeds during storage at the hatchery. During storage, lipids (fats) in the feed break down, causing rancidity that reduces the palatability of feed. Mold can create mycotoxins that affect fish kidney and liver function.  The  potency  of  vitamins,  especially  vitamin  C  and  thiamine,  also  decreases  during  storage. Spoilage of feed can be caused by excessive moisture from rain, condensation and high humidity; high temperatures; scavenger pests such as rodents and birds; insect infestations by weevils, beetles and moths; and spoilage by fungi, which can cause mold. Moldy feed shall never be fed to aquatic animals. Spoiled or otherwise unusable feed is both a resource and financial loss.

- A  covered,  well-ventilated  and  secure  building  should  be  constructed  for  the  specific  purpose  of  feed storage.  The  roof  should  protect  the  feed  from  rainfall  and  direct  sunlight.  All  ventilation  openings  and junctions between the roof and walls should be sealed with mesh coverings to prevent entry by scavenging rodents and birds. The air in the building should be as dry and cool as possible.

Hatcheries that utilize live or fresh-frozen feeds, or formulated dry hatchery diets that require refrigeration or freezing, must have facilities and equipment to produce and/or store such feeds in a fresh and sanitary manner.

The feed storage building shall be kept clean. Any spilled feed shall be collected and removed to avoid attracting  rodents.  The  storage  building  should  be  cleaned  before  new  feed  enters  storage.  When  the storage building is empty, the walls, floors and storage pallets can be sprayed with insecticide. The outside area around the feed storage building should not have tall weeds or other overgrown plants that provide cover for rodents or other pests. There should not be any stagnant water near the feed storage building.

Feed bags should be arranged in stacks on pallets or above-ground racks. Feed shall not be stored directly on the floor because spoilage may occur from condensation. There should be a 1-m gap between and around stacks and between stacks and storage building walls and at least 1.5 m between the top of a stack and the roof. Stacks that are more than 4 m high can cause damage of feed pellets in bags at the stack bottom, creating fine feed particles that are usually not consumed by fish and can contribute to environmental waste loading. Bagged feed should be handled carefully because rough handling can damage pellets and create fines.  Excessive  handling  of  feed  bags  should  be  avoided.  Walking  or  sleeping  on  feed  bags  should  be discouraged.

The hatchery shall keep an accurate and current inventory of all feed types used. The oldest feeds should be used first (first in, first out). Feeds should not be stored past the manufacturer's recommended use date, usually 90 days, especially in the tropics. Feed purchases should be managed to keep feed fresh.

Measures shall be taken to prevent infestation of feed storage buildings by animal and insect vectors and pests.  Hatcheries  and  nurseries  shall  have  a  Pest  Management  Plan  for  the  control  of  key  pests.  The hatchery shall designate an individual responsible for pest management in the feed storage building, for documenting regular inspections of the feed storage building to monitor for pest activity or infestation, and for training workers on proper feed handling and storage. Traps shall be placed in the feed storage building for control of rodents. Pesticide applications may be necessary, and these shall be documented and done using only legally approved chemicals and safe application methods by trained workers.

Spoiled or expired feed can be disposed of in a landfill and handled similarly to other solid wastes generated by the hatchery. Given that feed is decomposable, spoiled feed can be composted or used as an agricultural fertilizer for plant or tree crops. Spoiled feed shall never be dumped directly into aquatic ecosystems.

## Solid Waste Disposal

Solid  wastes  generated  at  hatcheries  and  nurseries  include  decomposable  wastes  such  as  kitchen  and housing wastes (garbage) and expired or moldy feed, dry materials such as paper and glass, various bulky items, discarded hatchery supplies and equipment (tires, pallets, bags used for feed, chemicals, chemical barrels,  pumps  and  motors,  and  vehicle  parts),  construction  debris,  and  electronic  wastes  (computers, mobile phones). Solid wastes may also include biofouling organisms removed during onshore net-cleaning operations.  If  these  wastes  are  not  disposed  of  properly,  there  is  a  risk  of  environmental  pollution  and unsanitary hatchery conditions. Hatcheries and nurseries shall take a systematic approach to managing solid wastes by developing a plan that specifies procedures for the collection, storage, and disposal of solid wastes. In general, the approach should be to reduce, reuse, or recycle potential wastes of any kind. Paper and plastic should be recycled if possible. Waste collection for recycling requires readily accessible waste containers that are serviced at regular intervals.

Solid wastes should not be allowed to accumulate on hatchery property. Such wastes shall be collected promptly as it is generated and placed in temporary solid waste storage areas (dumpsters, bins) prior to final disposal. Solid wastes shall be disposed of responsibly in a well-designed and legally operated sanitary landfill. Solid wastes shall not be dumped in open areas of mangroves or other wetlands or vacant land. Hatchery  solid  wastes  should  not  be  incinerated  unless  part  of  a  waste-to-energy  production  facility.  If wastes are composted, the process should not create an odor problem or attract wild animals. Biofouling organisms on net cages shall not be cleaned at the production site. Nets should be transported to a shorebased facility for cleaning in facilities designed to capture solid wastes from net cleaning. Biofouling solid wastes should be diverted into a sedimentation pond, sanitary sewer or other treatment system.

## Managing Derelict Gear, Marine Litter and Plastic Waste

Some aquaculture production systems require deployment of cages or net pens, rafts, racks, moorings, marker buoys, floating docks or other gear that floats or is submerged near the water surface. All deployed gear shall be clearly marked or identified as property of the hatchery. During extreme weather events with high wind, waves and flooding, gear may become detached or damaged. Once safe to do so, every effort shall be made to retrieve this gear from the bottom, adjacent shorelines, or water surfaces. Damaged gear that is retrieved can be repaired or disposed of like other solid wastes in a sanitary landfill. A procedure shall be in place for the management and recording of lost, 'end of life' or recovered aquaculture gear to control any risks of entanglement with wildlife.

Aquaculture uses many plastic items, including synthetic ropes, netting, floats and buoys, drums, buckets, trays, feed bags, plastic bags for transport of fry or post-larvae, Styrofoam cooler boxes, various packaging materials,  boats,  pipes,  tanks,  and  pond  liners,  among  many  other  items.  Hatcheries  are  encouraged  to conduct a plastics inventory to track the procurement, use and disposal of all plastic items in an effort to

avoid release to the environment. All plastics shall be disposed of in a manner that will not generate marine litter or have other detrimental impacts on the environment. Records of how this waste material is disposed of shall be retained.

## Mortality Disposal

Occasionally large numbers of aquatic animals will die as a result of natural causes or human error. Dead aquatic animals, whether arising from an acute mortality episode or chronic daily mortality, shall be removed promptly and placed in dedicated containers. Containers of stored aquatic animal waste should be leakproof  and  secured  to  prevent  contact  with  aquatic  animals,  other  animals  or  birds  and  unauthorized personnel. Aquatic animal waste containers should be labeled with regard to content. Dead aquatic animals should be stored for the minimum time that is practical before disposal and storage containers should be cleaned to prevent insect infestation. The storage area should be separated from hatchery production areas and bodies of water to minimize the risk of spread of pathogenic agents. Transport should be accompanied by appropriate documentation detailing origin, content, and destination to allow tracing if required.

Aquatic animal waste infected by an agent causing a disease referred to as 'listed' in the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code, or suspected of being so, may not be transported without permission from the Competent Authority. The Competent Authority may assess the requirement for this condition based on the disease situation in the Member Country (e.g., where a disease referred to in the Aquatic Animal Health Code is enzootic in the Member Country).

Mortalities  shall  be  disposed  of  on  land  by  responsible  procedures,  including  rendering,  incineration, sterilization, composting, biogas production, ensiling or burial after removal by a competent contractor and in  accordance  with  all  applicable  regulations.  Carcasses  shall  never  be  discarded  in  water  bodies. Equipment used for transportation of aquatic animal waste shall be cleaned and disinfected before being returned to the hatchery.

## Implementation

Since  a  high  level  of  welfare  is  a  prerequisite  for  good  animal  health,  high  level  aquatic  animal husbandry practices must also be an integral part of the facility's written HMP. An Animal Welfare Section (AWS) of the HMP shall describe programs and procedures that the facility follows to assure that animal welfare issues are identified and addressed. Its implementation shall be overseen by a qualified AAHP and/or member of facility management, one of whom shall be available at the time of the audit to present the plan and answer questions.

The AWS shall specifically include details of how brood animals are to be treated. This includes, but is not limited to, interventions used to induce maturation or spawning, such as eyestalk ablation in shrimp, hormone injection in fish, manual extraction of eggs and sperm and/or sacrifice of brood animals of any species, procedures shall be designed to minimize animal suffering.

These procedures may include sedation of live animals before handling, use of sterile instruments for surgical procedures, and handling techniques that minimize animal stress. Invasive procedures shall only be used if viable, non-invasive alternatives are not available.

Prevention  and  protection  are  the  two  general  approaches  to  control  disease  pathogens  and  their spread. The goal of prevention is to manage the rearing environment, primarily through husbandry Best Management Practices, to minimize stress on farmed aquatic animals, thereby reducing susceptibility to disease. Maintaining water quality within the tolerance limits of the aquatic animals, using highquality feeds that meet nutritional needs, and stocking at a density that will not cause stress are the key approaches. The goal of protection (biosecurity) is to limit the pathogen from entering the hatchery or nursery. Using disease-free broodstock for stocking, disease monitoring, using water that is free of pathogens, hygienic practices (e.g., disinfection), all-in, all-out stocking and harvesting, and control of vectors are some options to prevent pathogen entry.

## Animal Health Management Plan

The Animal Health Management Plan is the practical guide to the activities and practices that are implemented to maintain aquatic animals in good health and thus realize their productive potential. The Animal Health Management Plan shall be linked to the biosecurity and welfare plans. A hatcheryspecific written Animal Health Management Plan shall include, at minimum, the following elements:

- · Protocols for water quality management to maintain water quality within the tolerance limits of aquatic animals - aeration, water exchange, liming, fertilization, etc.
- · Protocols  for  feeding.  How  the  hatchery  will  meet  the  nutritional  requirements  of  aquatic animals for each life stage.
- · Routine disease surveillance and characterization of the health status of the hatchery. Regular health  monitoring  is  a  fundamental  part  of  the  health  and  welfare  management  of  aquatic animals. It provides an early warning detection system that allows rapid response to disease outbreaks. Protocols for regular observation of the behavior and welfare of aquatic animals shall  be  described.  Operational  disease  surveillance  shall  be  demonstrated  by  a  healthmonitoring  record-keeping  program.  The  plan  shall  describe  the  diagnostic  capacity  (onhatchery and contracted labs) available to support infectious disease surveillance.
- · Disease diagnosis techniques that will be used to evaluate prevalence of expected diseases.
- · Disease  control  procedures  that  will  be  followed  in  the  event  of  disease  outbreaks.  The procedures  shall  consider  a  broad  range  of  options,  including  vaccination,  quarantine, therapeutic  treatments,  and  treatment  types  (e.g.,  medicated  feed,  baths,  or  dips,  etc.)  and humane slaughter (euthanasia). The steps followed shall include reporting to the Competent Authority if the disease is listed by the OIE or is required by local regulations. Procedures shall also consider responses in the event of a disease emergency with potential to cause mass mortality.

To  demonstrate  that  the  Animal  Health  Management  Plan  is  operational  and  fit-for-purpose,  the hatchery  shall  maintain  or  have  access  to  regularly  updated  records  of  water  quality  monitoring, feeding, aquatic animal health and behavior, daily mortalities, disease outbreaks, and use of veterinary drugs, therapeutic chemicals, or disinfectants.

The Animal Health Management Plan shall be evaluated once per year to assess compliance with the plan, effectiveness in meeting  goals of improved  health and  greater survival, and whether documentation and record-keeping have been sufficient.

The Animal Health Management Plan shall designate a member of the hatchery staff as health plan manager that will be responsible for implementing health plan elements, maintaining the recordkeeping system, and training staff. The health plan manager shall be a professional aquatic animal veterinarian or  other  trained  specialist.  The  veterinary  professional  shall  guide  the  health  monitoring  program, conduct health checks, and prescribe any treatments deemed necessary.

## Biosecurity Plan

Biosecurity in aquaculture consists of all practices, activities and policies that minimize the risks from the  introduction  and  spread  of  aquatic  animal  diseases.  Biosecurity  in  aquaculture  spans  multiple levels of governance from international (e.g., OIE guidelines on introductions and transfers), to national (legislative  controls)  and  down  to  the  hatchery  level.  Each  hatchery  and  nursery  is  responsible  for biosecurity within the facility.

Proper biosecurity controls will minimize the risk associated with the introduction or spread of disease agents within a hatchery or nursery. The Biosecurity Plan shall be linked to the overall hatchery aquatic animal health and welfare plan. A hatchery-specific written Biosecurity Plan shall include, at minimum, the following elements.

- · Identification  of  the  likely  infectious  disease  risks  for  the  culture  species  within  the  region around the hatchery.
- · Identification  of  entry  and  exit  points  and  establishment  of  critical  control  points  such  as movement of aquatic animals and equipment, and hatchery access by visitors/contractors.
- · Active control measures to prevent disease introduction and spread by movement of aquatic animals. This includes new introductions, regular stocking and internal movements of aquatic animals. Stock health inspections and certificates shall be used to demonstrate the diseasefree status of batches of introduced aquatic animals.
- · Active control measures to prevent disease introduction and spread by movement of people and equipment. The plan shall establish protocols that allow tracing of equipment and people movements, such as through visitor and delivery logs.
- · Hygiene and sanitization protocols and standards for equipment and personnel.

To demonstrate that the Biosecurity Plan is operational and fit-for-purpose, the hatchery and/or nursery shall maintain regularly updated records that trace aquatic animal movements from hatchery to growout farm (see Traceability Section). Stock health inspections and certificates shall be retained and

compiled. Personnel, equipment, and vehicle movement logs shall be maintained. Logs of sanitization and disinfection events shall be maintained.

The Biosecurity Plan shall be evaluated once per year to assess compliance with the plan, effectiveness in meeting goals of improved biosecurity, and whether documentation and record-keeping have been sufficient.

The Biosecurity Plan shall designate a member of the hatchery staff as biosecurity plan manager that will be responsible for implementing biosecurity measures, maintaining the recordkeeping system, and training staff and making visitors aware of their roles and responsibilities in implementing biosecurity measures.

## Training

The biosecurity plan manager shall be responsible for training hatchery and nursery workers in:

- · Aquatic animal husbandry practices that provide a low-stress environment conducive to good growth and survival.
- · Identification  of  abnormal  behavior  and  external  clinical  signs  of  diseases  likely  to  be encountered on the hatchery.
- · Disease reporting and notification procedures.
- · Workers' responsibilities in the event of disease outbreaks.
- · Role of worker movements in transmitting diseases. Training logs shall be maintained by the biosecurity plan manager.

## Area Management

Although most BAP standards address facility-level impacts, they do not often address the cumulative impact of multiple aquaculture operations. Cumulative impacts are especially critical with respect to disease  transmission  among  neighboring  facilities,  irrespective  of  certification  status.  Aquaculture zones  or  areas  should  be  disease-free.  To  achieve  area  management  of  disease  risks,  qualifying hatcheries are required to make a good-faith effort to initiate or participate in an Area Management Plan to coordinate disease surveillance and control and other biosecurity activities with neighboring aquaculture  facilities  within  one  year  of  an  audit.  An  exception  is  provided  where  facilities  can demonstrate,  through  a  formal  disease  risk  assessment  by  qualified  and  independent  experts  in aquatic animal diseases, that there is a low risk of disease transmission among facilities.

## B. Welfare - All Production Systems

Hatcheries shall demonstrate that all operations are designed and operated with a focus on animal welfare to maximize survival and seed quality. Employees shall be trained to provide appropriate levels of husbandry and animal welfare.

- 4.20:  The  hatchery  shall  include  an  Animal  Welfare  Section  (AWS)  within  its  Health  Management  Plan (HMP), and all facility personnel shall receive training in its provisions at least annually.
- 4.21:  The AWS shall be written and/or approved by a qualified veterinarian or AAHP. Implementation of the AWS shall be overseen by a member of hatchery management or the AAHP, one of whom shall be available at the time of the audit to answer questions.
- 4.22:  The AWS shall include procedures for the humane treatment of brood animals during spawning and/or egg and sperm collection (whether induced or naturally occurring), and for slaughter where this is required.  The  procedures  shall  be  designed  to  identify  and  minimize  unnecessary  or  inadvertent animal suffering, and records shall be available to demonstrate compliance  with the procedures.
- 4.23:  The  AWS  shall  include  methods  for  the  humane  slaughter  of  surplus,  unwanted,  or  compromised animals  that  minimize  animal  suffering.  Records  shall  be  available  to  show  these  methods  are followed when animals are euthanized.
- 4.24:  The hatchery shall have a written Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) which defines and justifies acceptable  minimum  water  quality  limits  for  the  species  being  reared.  Daily  or  more  frequent monitoring records shall show that when these limits are breached, immediate corrective action is taken.
- 4.25:  The appearance and behavior of stocks in each production unit shall be observed at least once daily (including weekends and holidays) for signs of distress or poor health. Corrective medical or other actions taken to correct signs of distress or poor health shall be documented.
- 4.26: Mortalities, body condition factor, lesions, abrasions or fin damage, gill damage or condition, and other indicators appropriate to the cultured species shall be measured regularly in each production unit as individual-based welfare indicators of physical health.
- 4.27:  The  hatchery  shall  describe,  set  and  review,  stocking  density  limits  appropriate  to  the  production system, species, and size of animals being reared. Regardless of set stocking density limits, water quality parameters must remain within acceptable limits for the species. Documents shall be available to verify that these limits are observed.
- 4.28:  The hatchery shall develop procedures that minimize unnecessary stress or injury to animals arising from overcrowding, capture, and handling prior to and during internal and external transfer. Records of survival rates used as an indicator of the adequacy of such procedures shall be available.
- 4.29:  The hatchery shall develop and follow procedures to estimate the approximate number of animals in each shipment and provide documentation to show the estimated margin of error of the procedure used.

## Implementation

An  increasing  number  of  regulations  specifically  address  animal  welfare  and  the  humane  treatment  of farmed animals, particularly mammals and avian. Although few such regulations address fish, crustaceans and mollusks, similar principles should be applied to ensure that hatchery aquatic animals are produced using humane techniques.

For aquatic animals in aquaculture, welfare can be defined simply as an animal that is healthy and whose needs are met by the hatchery operator. Fundamentally, good welfare will lead to good health, i.e., freedom

from  disease.  Selecting  sites  and  managing  facilities  to  maximize  fish  welfare  can  improve  production potential by providing conditions conducive to good growth and high survival. Attention to aquatic animal welfare is a characteristic of responsible aquaculture.

Aquatic animals experience numerous stressors that can affect welfare. These include handling, transport, crowding, grading, vaccination, chemical or therapeutic treatments, stocking density (space), water quality, water velocity, light, feed (access, distribution, quality), social interactions, predator control, and parasites and diseases, among others. The welfare requirements of different species and different life stages vary and so practices and considerations to provide good welfare also vary. Each hatchery shall develop its own program to ensure good welfare of their aquatic animals. In general, culture conditions shall be managed to avoid situations that could lead to stress, injury or disease.

Hatcheries  and  nurseries  shall  apply  a  maximum  biomass  limit  based  on  standard  best  management practices and operational welfare indicators. Feeding shall be managed to avoid stress caused by under- or over-feeding.  For intensive production systems where there is a high risk to animal welfare in the event of a power failure, hatcheries shall have in place back-up or fail-safe systems (e.g., standby power generators, pure  oxygen  systems,  tractor-powered  paddlewheel  aerators,  emergency  alert  systems)  to  ensure maintenance of good water quality and support aquatic animal welfare.

## Welfare Indicators

Best management practices to maintain good culture conditions and routine surveillance as part of health and welfare monitoring program are the keys to promoting good fish welfare. Operational welfare indicators can be measured by hatchery workers trained to recognize normal and abnormal physical health, water quality  and  animal  behavior.  Regular  inspections  of  the  culture  facility,  water  quality  analysis,  and assessment of the behavior and condition of crustaceans or fish shall be conducted regularly.

## Individual - Physical Health

The  hatchery  shall  maintain  a  recordkeeping  system  for  individual-based  welfare  indicators  of  physical health. Mortality is one of the most basic indicators of aquatic animal welfare. Ideally floating dead fish would be removed and recorded as they appear at the water surface, but regular daily removal is best practice. Mortality is much easier to perceive and measure with finfish than with crustaceans.

Finfish  body  condition  factor  (L/W)  shall  be  measured  regularly,  preferably  weekly.  Various  physical abnormalities associated with external physical health shall be recorded, including lesions, abrasions or fin damage and gill damage or condition. Crustaceans will have a different set of indicators of physical health. A  scoring  system  can  be  used  to  assess  all  indicators  of  physical  health.  Sub-sampling  for  physical abnormalities can be done during normal biometric sampling, preferably weekly.

## Group - Water Quality

The hatchery shall maintain a recordkeeping system for group-based welfare indicators of environmental quality. Although hatcheries are required to measure the water quality of effluents, regular measurement of water quality to demonstrate that conditions are suitable for good production performance is also required. These are the same water quality variables that are normally measured as part of good husbandry practices. In  each  production  unit,  temperature,  salinity,  dissolved  oxygen  concentration,  pH,  ammonia  and  nitrite concentrations, and some index of solids concentration - transparency, turbidity, or total suspended solids concentration - shall be measured regularly, as determined by culture system type and production system intensity (i.e., stocking density). For finfish and crustacean species grown in flowing, tidal or turbulent water, current speed should be measured and not exceed limits defined by species and life stage. Fish should never be forced to the downstream end of the culture unit by water flow during the grow-out period. Hatcheries

shall have contingency plans and/or alarms in place in the event of system failure, including having staff oncall to respond to water quality emergencies.

## Group - Animal Behavior

The hatchery shall maintain a recordkeeping system for group-based welfare indicators of aquatic animal behavior.  Trained  hatchery  workers  shall  regularly  inspect  each  production  unit,  noting  the  behavior  of aquatic  animals  in  each  unit.  Through  training  and  experience,  hatchery  workers  learn  and  can  assess normal behavior. Often, a loss of appetite is the first sign of disease. Thus, regular assessment of feeding response is a component of health management that can permit rapid response, if necessary. Assessing feeding response can also indicate if fish are being underfed. Swimming behavior is a good indicator of group  welfare  in  a  production  unit.  Abnormal  swimming  behavior  such  as  vertical  orientation,  lethargy, whirling, flashing, rubbing, and piping are indicators of disease. For both behavior measures, hatcheries may develop  custom  indices  that  may  be  qualitative  or  semi-quantitative  (e.g.,  percentage  range  of  group exhibiting a certain behavior).

## Handling and Transport Operations

Aquatic  animals  that  are  concentrated  during  handling  operations  experience  stress.  Thus,  handling operations shall be conducted in ways that minimize stress, including limiting crowding time and time out of  water.  Procedures  for  routine  handling  operations  (crowding,  transfer,  grading,  vaccination,  chemical treatment,  etc.)  used  in  the  hatchery  shall  be  described  in  a  Standard  Operating  Procedure  document. Equipment used for handling operations shall be maintained in good working order and shall be maintained and used in ways that minimize the potential for animal injuries.

Chapter 7.2 of the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code provides detailed guidance on welfare of aquatic animals (especially  finfish)  during  transport,  including  planning  for  transport,  vehicles  and  transport  containers, procedures for maintaining water quality, preparation for transport, loading, transport and unloading. All live transport  operations  shall  be  done  with  due  consideration  to  aquatic  animal  welfare,  biosecurity,  and potential  disease  transmission,  and  minimizing  physical  injuries  to  preserve  product  quality.  Transport containers and vehicles shall be washed and disinfected before and after use. Aquatic animals shall be loaded at densities suitable for the species and for distance travelled to other production units. If live aquatic animals are transported from one production unit to another within the hatchery, animals shall be acclimated to  new conditions prior to unloading. A transport logbook shall be maintained that includes information about the group of aquatic animals loaded to allow traceability to destination, and mortalities that may occur during transport.

## Training

Hatchery workers shall be trained in their roles and responsibilities in maintaining the welfare of hatcheryreared aquatic animals. Hatchery managers are responsible for providing training to workers about:

- · Evaluation of welfare indicators, including normal and abnormal behavior, signs of poor welfare and expected diseases.
- · Water quality management and aquatic animal husbandry.
- · Aquatic animal handling procedures (crowding, disease treatment, transfers, loading for transport).
- · Humane euthanasia methods.

Training logs shall be maintained by the hatchery to indicate worker training activities.

Note: Auditors must verify this volume data and include summary data in the audit report.

- T13: The hatchery, regardless of the star status claims being made for harvested products, shall provide data  for  the  auditor  to  perform  at  a  minimum  one  trace-back  exercise  to  the  origin  of  stocking materials, and one trace-forward exercise to a farm or purchaser of harvested products. Results of these exercises shall be in line with expectations.

Note: At the discretion of the auditor, more trace exercises may be conducted.

## Implementation

Hatcheries may utilize any traceability system  that  meets the  BAP  requirements.  This  can  be  an  online system;  the  hatchery's  own  in-house  database,  paper  records,  files  and  documents;  or  a  combination thereof. Hatcheries are encouraged to consider implementation of an electronic supply chain traceability system  such  as  blockchain.  Where  paper  records,  documents  or  notebooks  are  used,  if  possible,  the information should also be transferred to computer database files to allow preparation of data summaries and facilitate electronic transmission. Transition to internal and/or third-party electronic traceability systems is  encouraged,  e.g.,  using  GDST  data  recommendations  for  interoperability.  The  original  files  or  paper records shall be kept for two-years to allow verification of the electronic data.

The record-keeping process requires a high degree of care and organization. At large hatcheries, managers could collect initial data for those aquaculture products for which they are responsible. A single clerk or team could  then  be  given  the  task  of  collecting  the  data  from  managers  and  transferring  it  to  a  computer database. Hatchery management shall review the effort at intervals to verify it satisfies BAP requirements.

The hatchery shall keep complete and accurate records of the following:

- · Sources of stocking material (broodstock, eggs, post-larvae and fingerlings).
- · Feed sources, types and quantities, feed mill owner/business identification, location.
- · Therapeutic treatments, with dose, treatment duration, and treatment completion date.
- · Chemicals (disinfectants, fungicides, parasiticides, herbicides, algicides and other pesticides/chemicals).

Records must be kept in relation to each production unit for each production cycle. Production unit-related records can be captured on the sample Product Traceability Form (Appendix E). Each form corresponds to the shipment of hatchery products on a particular day from a particular culture unit.

## Product Identity Preservation

To  assure  the  integrity  of  the  Best  Aquaculture  Practices 'star' system, traceability controls must be in place that allow verification of all facilities that contribute to the claim of multiple-star BAP-certified status.

To  ensure  the  proper  separation  and  traceability  of  all  hatchery inputs and  outputs, the following components must be in place:

- · Hatcheries that purchase all of their broodstock, eggs, shrimp postlarvae, fish fry or fingerlings and feed from BAP-certified sources shall maintain records of the sources of stocking material and feeds used.
- · Hatcheries that purchase stocking material and feed from both BAP- and non-BAP-certified sources shall identify all sources and have adequate systems in place to prevent mixing of BAP and non-BAP production  lots.
- · To enable mass balance verification of multiple-star products, certified hatcheries shall maintain a list, including harvest dates and volumes, of the farms to which they sell or deliver products.

The results of trace-forward and trace-back exercises and their mass balance shall be recorded. The auditor shall record the traceability and mass balance data in the audit report.

## BAP Logo Use

Use  of  the  Best  Aquaculture  Practices  logo,  a  registered trademark of the Global Seafood Alliance, for any purpose shall be approved by BAP in advance and used in compliance  with  the BAP trademark  usage agreement.

## Customer Complaints

The hatchery must prepare and implement an effective system for the management of complaints and complaint data  to  control  and correct  shortcomings relating  to  its  products' compliance with the BAP standards.

## Appendix A - Loading Indices - All Production Systems

This section describes procedures to estimate effluent volume that will be used to calculate a water use index (volume of water used divided by annual fish or shrimp production). Estimations of water use and effluent volume, along with information about effluent water quality and production system time, will be used to calculate nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the environment, expressed as mass per year and mass per fish or shrimp production. This information shall be collected and reported by hatcheries to auditors. The production system scenarios identified below are not intended to be comprehensive, but rather cover the majority of production systems used by BAP-certified hatcheries and nurseries. Other methods of calculating effluent volume and nutrient mass loading may be suitable for systems not identified below, but such alternative methods may only be used with documented prior approval of BAP.

## Calculation of Annual Effluent Volume

An estimation of annual effluent volume shall be determined using one of the following equations.

## Hatchery Discharge Calculation

## Embankment Ponds - Pump Discharge Method

Hatchery discharge (m3/yr) = Pump discharge (m3/min) x Average time of pump operation (hr/day) x 60 min/hr x 365 days/y

## Raceways

Effluent volume (m3/yr) = Velocity of flow in raceway (m/sec) x Raceway width (m) x Raceway depth (m) x Annual time of operation (days/yr) x 86,400 sec/day

## Tanks

Effluent volume (m3/yr) = Tank volume (m3) x Number of tank water exchanges per day x Annual time of operation (days/yr)

## Recirculating Aquaculture Systems

Effluent volume (m3/yr) = System volume (m3) x Fraction (0-1) of system volume replaced with new water per day x Annual time of operation (days/yr).

Other appropriate methods can be used.

## Water Use Index

Although not recommended, it is possible to comply with numerical water quality criteria by increasing the amount of water passing through an aquaculture facility to dilute the concentrations of tested variables. Compliance with the water use index assures that facilities meet water quality criteria through good management rather than diluting effluents before they are released into natural waters. A water use index shall be estimated using the following equation.

Water use index (m3/kg fish or shrimp) = Annual effluent volume (m3) ÷ Annual fish or shrimp production (kg)

## Calculation of Annual Effluent Loads

Loads of water quality variables are more indicative of the pollution potential of hatchery effluents than separate measurements of concentrations of these variables and effluent volume. Annual loads for total phosphorus and total nitrogen shall be calculated as indicated for each production system type. Information indicated by a line must be provided by the hatchery and recorded on audit reports.

Nutrient load indices shall be estimated using the following equations, depending on production system.

## Flow-through systems with solids capture in quiescent zones or settling basins

Nitrogen load (kg/yr) = [Total feed (kg) x Nitrogen (% in feed) ÷ 100] - [Harvested aquatic animals (kg) x Nitrogen (% in fish) ÷ 100] x 0.80

Nitrogen load index (kg/mt) = Nitrogen load (kg/yr) ÷ Annual production (mt/yr)

Phosphorus load (kg/yr) = [Total feed (kg) x Phosphorus (% in feed) ÷ 100] - [Harvested aquatic animals (kg) x Phosphorus (% in fish) ÷ 100] x 0.50

Phosphorus load index (kg/mt) = Phosphorus load (kg/yr) ÷ Annual production (mt/yr

## Recirculating Aquaculture Systems

Nitrogen load (kg/yr) = Effluent volume (m 3 /yr) x NO3-N concentration (mg/L) ÷ 1000 g/kg Nitrogen load index (kg/mt) = Nitrogen load (kg/yr) ÷ Annual production (mt/yr) Phosphorus load (kg/yr) = Effluent volume (m 3 /yr) x Total P concentration (mg/L) ÷ 1000 g/kg Phosphorus load index (kg/mt) = Phosphorus load (kg/yr) ÷ Annual production (mt/yr)

- * Here RAS are defined as systems 1) with a recirculating flow that is &gt;90% of total water flow and 2) with greater than 1% new water per day of total system volume. Recirculating systems with less than 1% new water per day of total system volume are exempt from effluent monitoring.
- ** Percent saturation of dissolved oxygen shall be calculated based on temperature and altitude of the
- facility. Online calculators can be used for the calculations: http://www.waterontheweb.org/under/waterquality/DOSatCalc.html***   Water with less than 1 ppt salinity, specific conductance below 1,500 µmhos/cm or chloride less than 550 mg/L is considered fresh

## Sampling

- · Samples shall be collected just prior to locations where effluents enter natural water bodies or exit the hatchery property. Samples shall be collected so that mixing of effluent and water from the receiving body is prevented.
- · For hatcheries with multiple effluent outfalls, all or several outfalls shall be sampled to prepare a composite sample for analysis. Where there are four or more outfalls, three outfalls shall be selected as sampling locations.
- · Water shall be collected directly from the discharge stream of pipes or dipped from the surface of ditches or canals with a clean sampling bottle. The sample will be placed on ice in a closed, insulated container to prevent exposure to sunlight.
- · Samples or direct measurements for dissolved oxygen and pH shall be obtained between 0500 and 0700 hours, and 1300 and 1500 hours on the same day. The average of the two measurements of each variable will be used for verification of compliance.
- · Samples for other variables shall be collected between 0500 and 0700 hours.
- · The number of ponds or grow-out units being drained for harvest at the time of sampling shall be recorded.
- · Samples of source water shall be collected quarterly directly in front of the pump station or from the pump discharge outlet but before pumped water mixes with water in the internal water supply system  of  the  hatchery.  Comparing  water  quality  between  source  and  effluent  can  be  used  to calculate  annual  loads  and  justify  an  exemption  for  water  quality  monitoring  of  variables  that demonstrate no deterioration between source and effluent

## Analysis

- · Water samples should be processed, and measurements made promptly. Test kits for field or onsite laboratory can be used for analysis of total ammonia nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, nitrate and chloride. Samples should be diluted with deionized or distilled water to bring test samples into the test  kit  concentration  range  for  individual  variables  as  needed.  Total  suspended  solids,  total phosphorus and 5-d biochemical oxygen demand should be measured by laboratories with technical capacity to conduct those tests.
- · Measurements for dissolved oxygen and pH shall be taken in situ with portable meters. pH of water samples collected for dissolved nutrients can also be measured in on-site water quality laboratories. Auditors  shall  verify  the  correct  application  of  dissolved  oxygen  and  pH  meter  calibration procedures.

## Auditing

- · A  map  of  the  hatchery  layout  indicating  pumping  stations,  effluent  outfalls  and  receiving  water monitoring  points  shall  be  provided  to  auditors.  These  areas  should  be  visited  and  viewed  for obvious signs of impaired water quality near outfalls.
- · Auditors  will  inspect  and  evaluate  operation  of  the  on-site  water  quality  laboratory,  the  water sampling program and the effluent monitoring recordkeeping system. Auditors can reject analytical results  if  sampling,  in  situ  measurements  or  water  quality  laboratory  protocols  and  analytical procedures are deficient.

## Sampling

- · A minimum of two sampling stations shall be established. One shall be at the approximate center of the cage site or net pen area. The other three station must be from 50 to 100 m away from the cages, in the prevailing down current direction. It is recommended that these sampling stations be geolocated with fixed buoys or geographic positioning systems (GPS).
- · The auditor must approve locations of the stations, which shall be set following a study on prevailing surface currents. For methods, refer to: Estimating Surface Currents Using Dyes and Drogues, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -
- http://chl.erdc.usace.army.mil/library/publications/chetn/pdf/chetn-vi -37.pdf.
- · Secchi disk visibility shall be measured on a clear day, around midday, with the sun behind the viewer but not in shadow. The recorded value should be the average of the depth of disappearance and the depth of reappearance of the disk.
- · Direct measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration shall be made between 0600 and 0900 hours.
- · Water for measurement of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration shall be collected at each sampling station with a Kemmerer or van Dorn water sampler, or by use of a weighted bottle from which the stopper can be removed by yanking on a calibrated line. Samples shall be transferred to clean sampling bottles and placed in ice in a closed, insulated container to avoid exposure to sunlight.
- · Water samples from the two sampling stations shall be blended (1:1) to create a composite sample for analysis of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration.

## Analysis

- · Water samples shall be processed, delivered to a water quality laboratory and measurements made promptly. Analysis of the samples shall be done by a private or government laboratory following standard methods as published by the American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association and Water Environment Federation - www.standardmethods.org.
- · Measurements for dissolved oxygen concentration shall be taken in situ  with  a portable meter. Auditors shall verify the correct application of dissolved oxygen meter calibration procedures.

## Appendix F - All Production Systems

## Calculation of Fish In:Fish Out and Forage Fish Dependency Ratios

For calculations of either FIFO or FFDR, fishmeal and fish oil inclusion levels in feed shall include any meal or oil derived from wild-caught fish, krill, mollusks or any other wild marine animals.  However, fishmeal and fish oil derived from trimmings, by-products or other processing wastes, or invasive or aquacultured species are NOT included. Thus, if data are available for such ingredients, they can be subtracted from the inclusion levels used in the FIFO or FFDR calculations.

## Feed-Conversion Ratio

The feed-conversion ratio (FCR) is a measure of the amount of feed needed to produce a unit weight of the culture species. Hatcheries shall calculate and record FCR yearly using the following equation:

## Equation 1

Feed-conversion ratio = Annual feed use (mt) ÷ Net fish or crustaceans harvested (mt)

The feed-conversion ratio is also known as the economic FCR. Note that economic FCR is very sensitive to survival rate,  rising  sharply  if  the  survival  rate  drops  significantly. For precise calculation, the total weight of stocked juveniles is subtracted from the total weight of the harvested fish or crustaceans.

## 'Fish In:Fish Out' Ratio

The so-called 'fish in:fish out' ratio is one means of measuring the ecological efficiency of an aquaculture system. It compares the amount of fish consumed by the system (usually in the form of fishmeal and fish oil) with the amount of fish or crustaceans produced.

Aquaculture producers shall strive to obtain the lowest  fish  in:fish  out  ratio  practicable  in  order  to conserve industrial fish resources. Facilities shall calculate and record a final  yearly  fish  in:fish  out  ratio using  Equation  2  below.  In the absence of better, specific data from the feed supplier, the transformation yields  for  industrial  fish  to  fishmeal  and  fish  oil  to  be  used  are  22.5%  and  4.8%,  respectively.  If  feed manufacturers can demonstrate the actual yields of the source fish meal and fish oil in their feeds, those number can be used for this calculation.

## Equation 2

Fish in:fish out ratio = Feed fish inclusion factor of feed (from manufacturer) x feed-conversion ratio

Where feed fish inclusion factor = [Percent fishmeal in feed + Percent fish oil in feed] ÷ [Yield of fishmeal from wild fish (%) + Yield of fish oil from wild fish (%)]

The inclusion levels in Equation 2 shall include any meal or oil derived from wild-caught fish, squid, krill, mollusks or any other wild marine animals. However, they shall exclude meal or oil derived from fishery byproducts such as trimmings, offal and squid liver powder and aquaculture by-products such as shrimp head meal.

## Forage Fish Dependency Ratio

The FFDR is another means of measuring the ecological efficiency of an aquaculture operation. This method separately compares the amount of fishmeal and fish oil used in a given diet fed to the system with the wet weight amount of fish produced. The greater of these two values (fishmeal or fish oil) is then used as the total FFDR for the system. In cases where aquatic animals are provided with feed of relatively high protein and lipid to meet requirements, fish oil derived from forage fish is more limiting than fishmeal. In that case, the FFDR for fish oil is reported. Hatcheries shall calculate and record a final production cycle FFDR as follows:

## Equation 3

FFDRfishmeal = (Percent fishmeal in feed x FCR)/22.5 FFDRfish oil = (Percent fish oil in feed x FCR)/4.8 FFDR = The greater of FFDRfishmeal or FFDRfish oil Examples of FFDR calculations where:

- a) fishmeal inclusion level = \_\_\_\_\_ %
- b)
- fishmeal from trimmings* =             %
- c) fish oil inclusion level = \_\_\_\_\_ %
- d)
- fish oil from trimmings* =            %
- e) fishmeal yield % = \_\_   (use 22.5 if value is unknown)
- f) fish oil yield % = \_\_\_    (use 4.8 if value is unknown)
- g) eFCR = \_\_\_\_

eFCR = Economic Feed conversion ratio = total annual feed use  ÷ (Total harvested fish weight - weight of juveniles initially stocked)

(* obtain from feed supplier; use 0 if unknown; includes by-products, or other processing wastes, or invasive or aquacultured species)

## Example:

Consider a feed that contains 20.0% fishmeal and 12.0% fish oil, and in the example below, the feed mill has provided documentation that states that no fishmeal and fish oil derived from trimmings were used.  eFCR was determined for the last year's harvested crops to be 1.2. Assume a yield of fishmeal from wild fish of 22.5% and yield of fish oil from wild fish of 4.8%.  FFDRm and FFDRo would be calculated as follows:

In the above example. The FFDRo would be the figure reported for FFDR since it is the higher of the two values.

Taking again an example of a feed that contains 20.0% fishmeal and 12.0% fish oil, but in the case of the example below, the feed mill has provided documentation that 10% of the fishmeal (meaning 10 out of the 20%) and 10% of the fish oil (meaning 10 out of the 12%) are obtained from trimmings.  eFCR was determined for the year-class in grow-out to be 1.2. Assume a yield of fishmeal from wild fish of 22.5% and yield of fish oil from wild fish of 4.8%.  FFDRm and FFDRo would be calculated as follows:

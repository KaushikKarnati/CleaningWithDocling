## Introduction to this document

The MSC Disputes Process defines the process for stakeholders, CABs and other parties when there is a dispute about the determination of the CAB in a fishery assessment.

CABs shall use this document in conjunction with the MSC Fisheries Certification Process (FCP).

This document contains the Objection Procedure which defines the process for stakeholders, CABs and the independent adjudicator when there is an objection to the Final Draft Report and Determination of the CAB in a fishery assessment.

Stakeholders may use the following approaches to report concerns about fishery assessments:

- · Raise a complaint with the CAB as set out in the General Certification Requirements (GCR) Section 7.6.
- · Report an incident to the MSC's independent accreditation body, Assurance Services International (ASI).

These two options do not prevent certification of the fishery while they are investigated.

Nothing in the Objection Procedure prevents stakeholders from also raising a complaint with the CAB or reporting an incident with ASI, but the Objection Procedure will not be affected by the outcome of the incident or complaint (see 5.10.11).

## Derogations

A derogation indicates a measure that allows for all or part of the requirement to be applied differently, or not at all, to certain applicants or certificate holders. Derogations are indicated by a footnote including:

- · The authority who made the decision on the derogation.
- · The date or meeting number of the decision.
- · The date on which the derogation came into force or expires.
- · A short description of the derogation.

Derogations are also issued via the MSC Interpretation Log. The MSC shall inform CABs when derogations are issued.

## Implementation timeframe

## Effective date of the MSC Disputes Process v1.01

The effective date for the MSC Disputes Process v1.01 is 26 October 2022. Any initial or reassessment process that is announced on or after 26 October 2022 shall be conducted in conformity with the MSC Disputes Process v1.01.

## 5.12 General provisions relating to the objections process

- 5.12.1 Where these procedures require that any notice or document is to be submitted to the independent adjudicator or to the MSC within, or before, a specified time limit, the following provisions shall be applied in order to determine whether the notice or document was served in time:
- a. Any references to time shall be, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
- b. Any references to 'days' shall mean, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, 'United Kingdom working days'.
- c. A document served after 17:00 or at any time on a Saturday, Sunday or a United Kingdom public holiday will be treated as being served on the next working day.
- d. Where the time limits prescribed in these procedures do not account for statutory holidays in countries where involved stakeholders reside, the independent adjudicator may allow an extension of time limits to give effect to the intent of these procedures that all parties have the nominated number of days within which to respond.
- e. In exceptional circumstances, the independent adjudicator may consider and grant an extension to any of the time limits set out in these procedures.
- 5.12.2 Service shall be effective if made by hand, or by the provision of the information in an electronic document containing a digital signature.
- 5.12.2.1 All parties shall include the date of service on each submission.
- 5.12.3 Service by hand shall be effective when made. An electronic document is presumed to be received by the addressee when it enters an information system designated or used by the addressee for the purpose of receiving documents of the type sent and can be retrieved and processed by the addressee.
- 5.12.4 The working language of the MSC is English. Documents shall be submitted in English, or with an accompanying full English translation at the cost of the submitting party.
- 5.12.5 For the avoidance of any doubt, every notice or document issued, or published on the MSC website, by the independent adjudicator or the MSC, shall bear the date upon which it was so issued or posted and shall also specify the date upon which any subsequent notice, response, submission or document is required to be submitted in accordance with these procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of these procedures, and regardless of whether a particular document is published on the MSC website or not, any documentation submitted by any party to an objection, except for documentation relating to costs under Section 5.11, shall be available to any other party.

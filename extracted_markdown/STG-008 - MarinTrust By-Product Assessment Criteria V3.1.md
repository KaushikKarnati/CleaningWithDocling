## Foreword

MarinTrust 1 is the leading independent business to business certification programme for the marine ingredients value chain. Responsible sourcing and manufacturing is vital if marine ingredients are to remain a relevant ingredient in feed for culture, agriculture, pet care and directly in the production of consumer products, including cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Fishmeal and fish oil make up the largest share of marine ingredients today, however all marine ingredients are included in MarinTrust's scope.

To enable stakeholders to credibly demonstrate the commitment to responsible practice in areas of feed safety, raw material procurement, delivery, and throughout the production process, MarinTrust developed a robust Certification Programme, consisting of three main components:

The MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients: The verification and certification of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from approved fisheries and by-product species.

The MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard: The verification and certification of the chain of custody for marine ingredients (products) that come from MarinTrust certified factories along the value chain to the customer.

The Improver Programme: The verification and approval of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from accepted MarinTrust Improver fisheries.

The initial MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients (the 'Standard') was finalised  and  the  programme opened  for  applications  in  October  2009,  with  the  first  factory receiving IFFO RS (now known as MarinTrust) certification in February 2010. Version 2.0 was launched in July 2017.

The Standard and raw material (whole fish and by-product) assessment requirements have since been regularly  revised  in  line  with  relevant  international  norms,  such  as  those  set  by  the  International Organisation  for  Standardization  (ISO/IEC  17065 ,  ISO/IEC  17067 )  and  the  International  Social  and 2 3 Environmental Accreditation and Labelling (ISEAL) . This ongoing process ensures that the Standard 4 remains accessible, credible, and relevant to industry needs, and in particular that the assessment process continues to be robust.

Revisions  are  undertaken  by  a  series  of  expert  committees  within  the  MarinTrust  governance structure .  These  committees  represent  the  full  marine  ingredient  value  chain,  including  marine 5 ingredient producers, feed processors, fisheries and aquaculture standard holders and retailers as well as fisheries experts, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

## Introduction

## Governance

The MarinTrust programme is overseen by the MarinTrust Governing Body Committee (GBC), which is responsible for the continued advancement of the MarinTrust standards to ensure they remain both credible and relevant with respect to the stated objectives. The MarinTrust Fisheries Development Oversight Committee is responsible for the continued advancement of the MarinTrust raw material assessment (whole fish and by-product) requirements.

The MarinTrust Governing Body Committee has endorsed Version 3.0 of the MarinTrust By-product assessment criteria. Throughout the development of Version 3.0, the needs of the marine ingredients value  chain  and  interested  parties  have  been  at  the  centre  to  ensure  effective  representation throughout.

## About this document

This document defines what shall be achieved for the approval of by-product raw material against the 'MarinTrust  Global  Standard  for  Responsible  Supply  of  Marine  Ingredients  Version  3.0'  (the 'Standard') .

## Responsible raw material sourcing

As an essential prerequisite to the audit against the MarinTrust Standard, facilities must demonstrate that they source approved raw materials (whole fish or by-products) that are:

- · not sourced from Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity
- · do not stem from an endangered species
- · for whole fish, are from responsibly managed fisheries aligned with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries . 6

## Scope and applicability

This  document outlines the  assessment criteria for responsibly sourcing by-product raw materials used to produce MarinTrust certified marine ingredients.

These criteria apply to by-products from human and pet food sources as defined in the MarinTrust Standard.

Source fisheries cannot make a claim against the MarinTrust Standard.

The by-product under assessment is defined at a minimum by the species and fishing vessel flag state, and other relevant data to support the evidence base required to adequately assess the risks identified in the assessment methodology.

## Definitions

Definitions and terms are published on the MarinTrust website.

## Third-party assessments

Applicant facilities shall demonstrate compliance with the MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply  of  Marine  Ingredients to  become  a  'certificate  holder' under  the  MarinTrust  programme. Fishery assessments are a pre-requisite to an audit. Fishery assessments are conducted by a thirdparty, qualified Certification Body accredited to ISO/IEC 17065 . 7

The specified frequency of assessments is defined in the Quality Management System, available on the MarinTrust website.

## Registered Certification Bodies

A list of third-party accredited Certification Bodies to undertake the process of auditing against the MarinTrust Standard and issuing certificates can be found on the MarinTrust website.

## Further information

Further information regarding application, rules and regulations of the programme can be obtained from MarinTrust and/or the approved certification bodies listed on the MarinTrust website.

## MarinTrust by-product assessment criteria

## 1. MarinTrust V3.0 By-product assessment requirements

- 1.1. A species cannot be approved for use as a MarinTrust raw material if it is:
- 1.1.1. A marine mammal, reptile, amphibian or bird, or
- 1.1.2. Stems from fisheries that use dynamiting, poisoning and other comparable destructive fishing practices, or
- 1.1.3. Appears in CITES  Appendix 1 or 2, or 8
- 1.1.4. Is categorised as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List . 9
- 1.2. No materials from illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activity shall be used as MarinTrust raw material.
- 1.3. To demonstrate the by-product under assessment is compliant with clauses 1.1 and 1.2, the fishery assessor shall apply the MarinTrust by-product assessment methodology.

## 2. MarinTrust by-product assessment methodology

The by-product assessment methodology follows a stepwise approach to assess and score the byproduct under assessment against a set of criteria:

- 2.1. Step 1: IUCN Red list and CITES Check
- 2.1.1. Determine the eligibility of the by-product under assessment for MarinTrust approval by establishing whether the by-product species falls under the MarinTrust definition of ETP.
- 2.2. Step 2: IUU Risk Assessment
- 2.2.1. Establish  the  IUU  risk  level  of  the  flag  state(s)  responsible  for  catching  the  source material for the by-product under assessment.
- 2.3. Step 3: Management Framework Assessment
- 2.3.1. Where Step 2 has established that the flag state(s) exceed a risk threshold, determine what measures are in place to mitigate this risk in the case of the by-product under assessment.

## Annex 1: Summary of changes

## Summary of changes between Version 2 and Version 3

Version  3.0  of  the  MarinTrust  By-Product  Assessment  Criteria  aims  to  improve  the  assessment process, focusing on the legality of by-products sourced in the supply chain. It utilises an IUU riskbased assessment of the source country and includes additional checks on supplier agreements to prevent  IUU  fishing.  The  criteria  and  methodology  have  been  significantly  changed  but  CITES appendices and the IUCN Red List still check for endangered species. A summary of changes between Version 2 and Version 3.0 of the assessment criteria is presented in Table 1.

Table 1: Comparison of V2 and V3.0 of the MarinTrust by-product assessment criteria

## Annex 2: By-product assessment methodology and guidance

## Step 1: IUCN Red list and CITES Check

## Assessment criteria

2.1.1  Determine  the  eligibility  of  the  by-product  under  assessment  for  MarinTrust  approval  by establishing whether the by-product species falls under the MarinTrust definition of ETP.

## Assessment methodology

The assessor shall review the status of each by-product species against relevant CITES appendices and IUCN Red List categories.

## CITES

The assessor shall review if the species is listed on CITES Appendix 1 or 2 using the CITES database Species+ (speciesplus.net).

By-products from a species listed in Appendix 1 or Appendix 2 of CITES are ineligible for assessment and shall immediately fail the assessment.

If the species is not listed on CITES Appendix 1 or Appendix 2, it is eligible for assessment.

## IUCN red list category

The  assessor  shall  review  if  the  species  is  endangered  or  critically  endangered  on  the  IUCN  (the International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species:

## https://www.iucnredlist.org/

If  the  species  is  listed  by  IUCN  under  the  Red  List  for  the  following  categories,  the  species  shall immediately fail the assessment:

- · Extinct (E) and extinct in the wild (EW)
- · Critically endangered (CR)
- · Endangered (EN)

If the species is listed by IUCN under the Red List for the following categories, the species is eligible for assessment:

- · Vulnerable (VU)
- · Near threatened (NT)
- · Least concern (LC)
- · Data deficient (DD)

If the species is not listed on the IUCN Red List, it is assumed to pass this requirement and is eligible for assessment.

<!-- image -->

## Step 1 outcome

Should a species be identified as ineligible for assessment it cannot proceed any further and fails the overall assessment. The by-product species is Not Approved .

If the species is identified as eligible for assessment, the species shall be assessed against Step 2.

## Step 1 Guidance

The species is assessed in Step 1.

When completing the assessment, the assessor should refer to the latest published IUCN Red List. If the species has not been assessed on the IUCN Red List for more than 5 years, and there is a reason to question the IUCN status, the applicant or stakeholder should provide additional evidence to the Certification Body to demonstrate that the IUCN status is outdated. This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the assistance of MarinTrust.

Where the IUCN Red List or CITES Appendices have more than one assessment for a species, e.g. IUCN red list assessment is available for different fish stocks, the assessor shall request from the applicant additional information to support identification of the status of the species on the IUCN Red List or CITES Appendices.

## Step 2: IUU Risk Assessment

## 2.2.1 Assessment criteria

Establish the IUU risk level of the flag state(s) responsible for catching the source material for the byproduct under assessment.

## Assessment methodology Calculate the IUU fishing risk

A suite of indicators has been established to assess the risk of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing for vessel flag states (country). The indicators and risk thresholds are presented in Table 1.

For each by-product species, the assessor shall use Table 1 to determine the IUU risk scores for each flag state provided for the by-product species.

The IUU risk score for the flag state is calculated using a precautionary approach, using the highest risk score to determine the by-product IUU risk score in Step 2.  This means:

- · If any indicator used in Step 2 is high risk, the by-product species is categorised as high risk.
- · The by-product species is categorised as low risk only when all the indicators are low risk.

## Step 2 outcome

If the outcome of Step 2 is categorised as high risk, an evaluation of the by-product species against Step 3 is required.

If the outcome of Step 2 is categorised as low risk, the by-product species is Approved . No further assessment is required.

If the outcome of Step 2 is categorised as medium risk, the by-product species is Approved Source with Caution .

For medium risk by-product species, by-products are given an Approved Source with Caution outcome and additional checks are required during the audit. This ensures relevant steps are being taken by the facility to ensure it is mitigating the risk of sourcing a by-product species assessed as medium risk. The audit requirements are covered in clause 2.11.3 of the MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients (the MarinTrust Standard).

## Step 2 guidance

The vessel flag state is assessed in Step 2.

The flag  state  is  the  country  in  which  the  vessel  is  registered  (see  FAO  glossary  and  Voluntary Guidelines on Flag State Performance, FAO, 2014 (http://www.fao.org/3/a-mk052e.pdf)).

The  applicant  provides  flag  state  information  for  each  by-product  species  applied  for  in  the MarinTrust online application form which is shared with the CB.

If the flag state is not provided or is unknown, the by-product is classified as high risk and required to be evaluated against Step 3.

There may be one flag state or multiple flag states for each by-product under assessment. If there is more than one flag country for the by-product species, then the assessor shall complete the Step 2 IUU risk assessment for all flag countries and use the highest scoring (highest risk) flag state to determine the by-product IUU risk score.

The Step 2 outcome is defined below. Annex 2 provides a summary of the Step 2 risk rating for each flag state (country). Annex 2 will be updated whenever the indicator data is revised. Please refer to the latest version of this document for risk ratings.

| By-product risk rating after Step 2   | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Low risk                              | By-product species is low risk and is MarinTrust  Approved .  No  additional  requirements  in  the  MarinTrust  Standard  or  audit  for  low  risk  approved species.                                                                   |
| Medium risk                           | By-product  species  is  medium  risk  and  is  MarinTrust  Approved .  However,  the  Source  with  Caution label  indicates  additional  requirements  in  the  MarinTrust  factory  Standard,  which  shall  be  verified  during  the |
| High risk                             | By-product species must proceed to  Step 3 .                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Examples of By-product IUU risk outcome:

IF indicator 1 is categorised as high risk, AND indicators 2, 3 are categorised as medium risk, AND indicators 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are categorised as low risk, THEN Step 2 risk score is high risk.

IF indicators 1, 2, 3 are categorised as medium risk, AND indicators 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are categorised as low risk THEN Step 2 risk score is categorised as medium risk.

IF all the indicators are low risk, THEN Step 2 risk score is categorised as low risk.

## About risk assessment

Risk assessment provides a way for businesses to understand the landscape in which they operate. They are commonly used to help businesses identify where there may be issues, e.g. in a specific country or specific supply chain.

Risk assessment is part of a 'toolkit' on due diligence. But it only provides an initial indication of risk. It is not a replacement for understanding specific supply chains or individual companies/suppliers within the supply chain.

It is useful to start at the broad country level as this shows which countries may be associated with higher levels of IUU fishing risks. Beyond, that companies can dive deeper into their own sectors and supply chains.

Risk  assessment  can  use  different  measures  and  indicators,  depending  on  what  is  relevant  to include. And there are many different risk assessment methodologies available. However, many of these use common indicators.

## Step 3: Management Framework Assessment

## Assessment criteria

2.3.1 Where Step 2 has established that the vessel flag state(s) exceed a risk threshold, determine what measures are in place to mitigate this risk in the case of the by-product under assessment.

## Assessment methodology Additional information request

- · The Certification Body or assessor shall request additional information from the applicant to support the Step 3 assessment.
- · The  applicant  shall  be  given  a  maximum  of  30  calendar  days  to  submit  the  relevant information.
- · Information may be provided through the MarinTrust online application form and shall be confirmed by the assessor or Certification Body.
- · If  the  applicant  fails  to  provide  the  additional  information  by  the  given  deadline,  the  byproduct will be considered high risk and is Not Approved .

MarinTrust allows applicants to include by-products from approved whole fish fisheries in their application.  This  allowance  applies  under  certain  conditions  and  offers  a  risk  assessment adjustment for such by-products.

## Conditions:

- · The by-products must be derived from species that are from a whole fish fishery that is already MarinTrust approved.
- · The species of the by-products must match the species of the approved whole fish.

## Risk Assessment Adjustment:

- · By-products typically assessed as high risk can be downgraded to medium risk if they meet the above conditions.
- · This  downgrading  of  the  risk  does  not  require  additional  requests  for  traceability information or a Category C assessment.
- · A  MarinTrust  whole  fish  assessment  sufficiently  addresses  the  risks  of  overfishing  and traceability, which are key components of the by-product risk assessment.

## 1. Management framework evaluation -fishery assessment

## Category C assessment

- · The assessor shall complete a Category C assessment of the by-product species stock.
- · The assessment uses the Category C species assessment criteria in Table 2, and guidance for Category C by-product assessment is presented in Annex 2a.

## Table 2: Category C assessment criteria

- C1.1 Fishery removals of the species in the fishery under assessment are included in the stock assessment process OR are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible.
- C1.2 The species is considered, in its most recent stock assessment, to have a biomass above the limit reference point (or proxy), OR removals by the fishery under assessment are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible.

## 2. Management framework evaluation -traceability to source fishery

Based on information from the applicant, the assessor will choose one of two methods (paths) to determine if the traceability information for high-risk by-product species is adequate.

## Path 1: Whole fish Key Data Elements (KDEs)

For the by-product under assessment, the assessor has received all relevant Key Data Elements (KDEs) as defined in the MarinTrust Standard clauses 2.11.2.2 and 3.2.5. These KDEs relate to the whole fish from which the by-products are sourced:

- · Vessel  details:  name  of  vessel,  International  Maritime  Organisation  (IMO)/registration number (as applicable), call sign, legal owner, name and address of legal owner, flag state.
- · Authorisation for fishing: license / permits as applicable fishing: all permitted fishing methods, fishing gear for the vessel.
- · Species (including scientific name) and quantity discharged to the facility.
- · Catch areas where catch originated.
- · Catch date (this can include date of fishing, dates of specific fishing trip, dates at sea during which the consignment was caught).
- · Fishing method / gear used for the catch of fish (if the vessel is multi-rig).

## Path 2: Calculate further risk score using port and coastal state risk

The assessor uses Table 3 to determine IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated) risk scores for the coastal state and port state for the by-product species.

## Path 2 guidance

There may be multiple coastal or port states for each by-product under assessment. If there is more than one coastal or port state for the by-product species, then the assessor shall complete Step 3 path 2 evaluation for each country and use the highest scoring (highest risk) state to determine the by-product IUU risk score.

## Step 3 outcome

There are four possible outcomes at Step 3.

## Outcome 1:

If the by-product passes the Category C assessment and has sufficient traceability information (Path 1), it is downgraded to medium risk and is Approved (Source with caution).

## Outcome 2:

If the by-product passes the Category C assessment but has high-risk traceability information (Path 2), it remains high risk and is Not Approved.

## Outcome 3:

If the  by-product  passes  the  Category  C  assessment and has  medium  or  low-risk  traceability information (Path 2), it is downgraded to medium risk and Approved (Source with Caution).

## Outcome 4:

If the by-product fails the Category C assessment, it remains high risk and is Not Approved, regardless of the traceability information.

## Step 3 guidance

The  further  evaluation  in  Step  3  will  support  the  risk  mitigation  and  allow  the  applicant  to demonstrate their ability to mitigate potential IUU risks associated with by-product raw materials in their supply chain. This mitigation is done through further evaluation of the status of the raw material source fishery.

The Category C assessment evaluates the status of the fishery (to stock level). Passing a category C assessment, the species is demonstrated to be sourced from a managed fishery and that the stock is not overfished.

Traceability  information  offers  assurance  that  the  source  fishery  for  the  by-product  under assessment can be identified, by receiving key data elements (KDEs) for the by-products sourced offers  more  visibility  into  the  supply  chain  and  increases  the  opportunity  to  identify  and  avoid potential IUU fishing risks.

What do better practices look like?

Comprehensive data collection and sharing: Collect detailed information using Key Data Elements

<!-- image -->

(KDEs) including vessel identification and authorisation, species, catch areas, fishing method and dates.

Supply chain transparency: Maintain detailed records at each step of the supply chain, from capture to final sale, to ensure traceability.

Interoperable systems and technologies will support the collection and transfer of this information.

## Annex 2a: Step 3 Category C species assessment guidance

In  a  by-product  assessment,  species  that  are  categorised  as  High-risk  in  Step  2  are  subject  to  a Category C species assessment in Step 3. Species must be subject to a species-specific management regime and are usually targeted species in fisheries for human consumption.

## Guidance for Category C assessment

C1.1  Fishery  removals  of  the  species  in  the  fishery  under  assessment  are  included  in  the  stock assessment process, OR are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible .

Stock assessments rarely specify if fishery removals are negligible. Here the assessor must look for evidence  such  as  management  measures  being  implemented  for  stock  rebuilding  and  that  the management measures are not contradicting scientific advice.

Examples of management measures: reduction in landings and effort, may also include increased landing controls, technical measures (such as gear modification or changes to minimum landing sizes) or spatial or temporal closures.

C1.2 The species is considered, in its most recent stock assessment, to have a biomass above the limit reference point (or proxy), OR removals by the fishery under assessment are considered by scientific authorities to be negligible.

The stock should be assessed in terms of the overall outcome objectives i.e to pass this clause there should be evidence that the stock status is above the point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired and will be at or above Blim.

Where  historical  estimates  of  stock  size  and  resulting  recruitment  are  available,  the  PRI  may  be identifiable as the point below which reduced recruitment has been observed in the past, and above which recruitment appears to be more related to environmental factors than to stock size.

The standard requires that management measures specify the actions to be taken in the event that the status of the stock under consideration drops below levels consistent with achieving management objectives that allow for the restoration of the stock to such levels within a reasonable time frame. This  requires  the  specification  in  advance  of  decision  rules  that  mandate  remedial  management actions  to  be  taken  if  target  reference  points  are  exceeded  and/or  limit  reference  points  are approached or exceeded or the desired directions in key indicators of stock status are not achieved. For example, decreasing fishing mortality (or its proxy) if the stock size approaches its limit reference point. This is a central component of the Precautionary Approach.

Default values for the levels of the PRI and BMSY, as used in scoring the stock status are given below.

They are often related to B0, the stock status that would be present in the absence of fishing.

In  the  case  where  neither  BMSY  nor  the  PRI  are  analytically  determined,  the  following  default reference  points  may  be  appropriate  for  measuring  stock  status  depending  on  the  species: BMSY=40%B0; PRI=20%B0=½BMSY.

- · In the case where either BMSY or the PRI are analytically determined, those values should be used as the reference points for measuring stock status unless additional precaution is sought.

<!-- image -->

- · In the case where BMSY is analytically determined to be greater than 40%B0, and there is no analytical determination of the PRI, the default PRI should be ½BMSY. This case covers the situation of low productivity stocks, where higher default PRIs may be justified.
- · In the case where BMSY is analytically determined to be lower than 40%B0 (as in some highly productive stocks), and there is no analytical determination of the PRI, the default PRI should be 20%B0 unless BMSY&lt;27%B0, in which case the default PRI should be 75%BMSY.
- · For stocks with average productivity, where BMSY is not analytically determined but assumed to  be  40%B0  and  a  management  trigger  reference  point  is  set  greater  than  40%B0  for precautionary  reasons,  the  default  PRI  should  still  be  set  at  20%B0=½BMSY  unless  it  is analytically determined.  This  covers  situations  where  the  management  authority  has deliberately chosen a conservative target reference point, but where the default PRI is still appropriate.
- · In cases where the PRI is set at 20% B0, a default value for the BMSY may be assumed to be 2xPRI. In other cases, for instance where the PRI is set at the lowest historical biomass, it cannot be assumed that BMSY = 2xPRI. Teams shall justify any reference point used as a proxy of BMSY in terms of its consistency with BMSY.

The default PRI values given above (½BMSY or 20%B0) apply to stocks with average productivity. Such points are generally consistent with being above the point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired, though for some short-lived stocks the actual point at which there is an appreciable  risk  that  recruitment  is  impaired  may  be  lower  than  20%B0  and  for  some  long-lived species it may be higher than this.

## Sources of evidence for the assessment:

- · Catch composition data
- · Stock assessments
- · Management measures for any stocks shown to be depleted
- · Evidence that the fishery is not hindering the recovery of the species below the PRI, such as evidence indicating a lack of gear interaction, or evidence pointing to an unrelated cause (or fishery) limiting recovery.

## Annex 3: Flag state risk rating for Step 2: IUU Risk Assessment

The individual indicators are updated periodically, typically annually or every two years or as/when a new dataset is available. As such, scores will vary.

Country risk scores and ratings can change depending on the performance of each indicator. A revised version of this document will be created to include the latest country ratings. This will be available from the MarinTrust website.

Use this Annex to identify the risk rating for each flag state in Step 2 or the coastal and port state in Step 3. Fishery assessors may be provided with additional datasets to complete the assessment.

It is essential that the latest ratings are used. Ensure you have the most up to date version of this document.

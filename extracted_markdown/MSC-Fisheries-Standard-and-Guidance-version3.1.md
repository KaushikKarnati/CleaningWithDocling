## The Marine Stewardship Council

## Vision

Our vision is of the world's oceans teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations.

## Mission

Our mission is to use our ecolabel and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world's oceans by recognising and rewarding sustainable fishing practices, influencing the choices people make when buying seafood, and working with our partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis.

## General introduction

## Fisheries certification

With international consultation with stakeholders, the MSC has developed standards for sustainable fishing and seafood traceability. These standards ensure that MSC labelled seafood comes from, and can be traced back to, a sustainable fishery.

The MSC standards and requirements meet global best practice guidelines for certification and ecolabelling programs.

The MSC Fisheries Standard sets out requirements that a fishery must meet to enable it to claim that its fish come from a well-managed and sustainable source.

Throughout the world, fisheries are using good management practices to safeguard jobs, secure fish stocks for the future, and help protect the marine environment. The science-based MSC environmental standard for sustainable fishing offers fisheries a way to confirm sustainability, using a credible, independent, third-party assessment process. It means sustainable fisheries can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace, and gives an assurance to consumers that their seafood comes from a well-managed and sustainable source.

The MSC Fisheries Standard applies to wild-capture fisheries that meet the scope requirements provided in Section 1.

The MSC Fisheries Standard is comprised of the following core Principles:

## Principle 1: Sustainable target fish stocks

A fishery must be conducted in a manner that does not lead to over-fishing or depletion of the exploited populations and, for those populations that are depleted, the fishery must be conducted in a manner that demonstrably leads to their recovery.

## Principle 2: Environmental impact of fishing

Fishing operations should allow for the maintenance of the structure, productivity, function, and diversity of the ecosystem on which the fishery depends. The ecosystem includes habitat and associated dependent and ecologically related species.

## Principle 3: Effective management

The fishery is subject to an effective management system that respects local, national, and international laws and standards, and incorporates institutional and operational frameworks that require use of the resource to be responsible and sustainable.

## Implementation timeframes

## Effective dates of the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1

This section outlines the circumstances under which the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1 shall be used. It is the intent of the MSC to ensure that all:

- · Initial assessments are against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1 as soon as possible.
- · Existing Units of Certification are given a period of at least 3 years to come into compliance with the revised Standard, as per Essential Component A.3.22 of the 'GSSI Global Benchmark Tool'.
- · Units of Certification are assessed against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 or the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1 within 8 years of the publication of MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0.

Publication date: 22 July 2024.

CABs shall conduct any initial assessment that is announced on or after 1 July 2026 in conformity with the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1.

CABs may elect to use the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1 as of the publication date (22 July 2024).

The CAB shall not announce a full assessment or reassessment against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 after the publication date of the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1.

For fisheries that are certified against a version of the MSC Fisheries Standard published before the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0, CABs shall apply the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1 by 1 November 2030 as per the MSC Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) v3.1, 7.32.

If an assessment has been announced against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0, the CAB may apply the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1 during the course of the certificate life. The CAB shall inform stakeholders and upload a stakeholder announcement to the MSC database for publication on the MSC website.

## Review

The MSC welcomes comments on the MSC Fisheries Standard. Comments will be considered as part of the next review process. The next review will start within 5 years of the publication of this document. Please submit comments for this review to standards@msc.org.

More information about the MSC policy-development process and the MSC Standard Setting Procedure can be found on the MSC website (msc.org).

## Introduction to this document

The MSC Fisheries Standard is composed of 3 core Principles and has 4 associated modifications for use in different types of fishery: SB, SC, SD, and SE.

## Guidance

Guidance is provided in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard to help CABs interpret the MSC Fisheries Standard. The MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard is maintained as a separate document.

The headings and numbering in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard, when included, match those in the MSC Fisheries Standard exactly, with numbers prefaced with the letter 'G' to indicate guidance.

The MSC recommends that CABs read the MSC Fisheries Standard in conjunction with the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard. Text in the MSC Fisheries Standard is not repeated in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard.

Where general guidance is provided that relates to the subject of a major heading, or relates to the content of a specific clause, this icon ◙ appears at the end of the title or clause in the MSC Fisheries Standard. These icons provide hyperlinks to the related guidance section in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard.

In the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard, this icon ▲ provides a hyperlink to the corresponding section or clause in the MSC Fisheries Standard.

## Auditability of guidance

The guidance in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard is not directly auditable.

## Derogations

Derogations are temporary normative measures that allow for an MSC requirement to be applied differently or disregarded. Derogations are provided:

- · In response to editorial errors.
- · In response to force majeure, where intent is no longer fit for purpose and threatens MSC credibility.
- · As a provision to test a policy change or modify the implementation timeframe when publishing a revised version of the normative document.

Derogations are posted on a public log. The MSC requires CABs to follow relevant derogations.

Table 1: Scope criteria for eligible enhanced fisheries

| A   | Linkages to and maintenance of a wild stock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| i   | At some point in the production process, the system relies upon the capture of fish and shellfish  from the  wild environment . Such fish and shellfish may be taken at any stage of the life cycle,  including eggs, larvae, juveniles, or adults. The 'wild environment' in this context includes  marine, freshwater, and any other aquatic ecosystems. |
| ii  | The  species are native  to the geographic region of the fishery and the natural production  areas from which the fishery's catch originates.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| iii | There are  natural reproductive components  of the stock from which the fishery's catch  originates that maintain themselves without having to be restocked every year.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| iv  | Where fish stocking is used in hatch-and-catch (HAC) systems, such stocking does not form a  major part of a current rebuilding plan for depleted stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| v   | The UoA shall incorporate some element of harvest of a wild population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| vi  | The UoA shall be managed so that the natural productivity and genetic biodiversity of the wild  population is not undermined with respect to any impacts on long-term sustainability.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| B   | Feeding and husbandry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| i   | The production system operates without  substantial augmentation of food supply .  In HAC systems, any feeding is used only to grow the animals to a small size prior to release  (not more than 10% of the average adult maximum weight), such that most of the total growth  (not less than 90%) is achieved during the wild phase.                      |
|     | In catch-and-grow (CAG) systems, feeding during the captive phase is only by natural means  (e.g. filter feeding in mussels), or at a level and duration that provide only for the maintenance  of condition (e.g. crustaceans in holding tanks) rather than to achieve growth.                                                                            |
| ii  | In CAG systems, production during the captive phase does not routinely require disease  prevention involving chemicals or compounds with medicinal prophylactic properties.                                                                                                                                                                                |

## MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1

## C Habitat and ecosystem impacts

- i Any modifications to the habitat of the stock are reversible and do not cause serious or irreversible harm to the natural ecosystem's structure and function. Modified habitats include fish aggregating devices (FADs).

Note: Habitat modifications that are not reversible, are already in place, and are not created specifically for the fishery shall be in scope. This includes:

- · Large-scale artificial reefs.
- · Structures associated with enhancement activities that do not cause irreversible harm to the natural ecosystem inhabited by the stock, such as salmon fry farms next to river systems.

## Introduced Species Based Fisheries

- 1.1.4 If the target species under Principle 1 is an introduced species, the UoA shall conform to all the criteria in Table 2.
- a. If the fishery targets an introduced species, the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) shall apply Section SD.

Table 2: Scope criteria for Introduced Species Based Fisheries

| A   | Irreversibility of the introduction in the new location                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| i   | The introduced species has a large population size that is comparable to or larger than the  population sizes of other native species occupying similar ecological niches in the new  location.                                                                                 |
| ii  | The species has spread to a range beyond that of its initial introduction in the new location.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| iii | There is evidence to demonstrate that the species cannot be eradicated from the location by  known mechanisms without serious ecological, economic, and/or social consequences.                                                                                                 |
| B   | History of the introduction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| i   | The species was introduced to the new location prior to 1993; this being the year that the  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which includes provisions on introduced species,  was ratified.                                                                           |
| ii  | If the introduction occurred after the CBD was ratified, such fisheries shall only potentially be in  scope if the introduction was non-deliberate and occurred at least 20 years prior to the date  the application is made for assessment against the MSC Fisheries Standard. |
| C   | No further introductions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| i   | There is no continuing introduction of the introduced species being considered for certification  to the location.                                                                                                                                                              |

## Conviction for a serious crime

## Scoring stock status

SA2.2.1 All management systems shall have reference points, as confirmed in Performance Indicator (PI) 1.2.4 scoring issue (b).

SA2.2.1.1 Where these are not stated explicitly, they should be implicit within the decision rules or management procedures (MPs). ◙

- SA2.2.2 When scoring PI 1.1.1 scoring issue (b), the team shall consider: ◙
- a. The biology of the species and stock status in recent years.
- b. The scale and intensity of both the UoA and management system.
- c. Other relevant issues in determining time periods over which to judge fluctuations.
- SA2.2.2.1 The rationale shall include details of the time period over which this is assessed.

SA2.2.3 If information is not available on the stock status relative to the PRI or MSY levels, the team shall use proxy indicators and reference points to score Performance Indicator (PI)

1.1.1. ◙

SA2.2.3.1

If the team uses proxy indicators and reference points to score PI 1.1.1, the team shall justify their use as proxies of stock biomass for the PRI and/or MSY.

SA2.2.3.2

If the team uses proxy reference points to score the stock biomass status, the team shall assign higher scores where greater confidence is provided by the proxy information. ◙

SA2.2.4 If the team uses recent trends in fishing mortality to score stock status, the team shall demonstrate that the fishing mortality rate (F) has been low enough for long enough to ensure that the required biomass levels are now 'likely' to be met. ◙

## Stock complexes ◙

## MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1

- SA2.2.5 If several species or stocks are fished as stock complexes, the team shall treat them as either:
- a. Separate UoAs, or
- b. Separate scoring elements within a single UoA, as in the case of multiple in-scope species considered under PI 2.1.1.
- SA2.2.5.1 In either case, the team shall seek evidence for each SG that, as an outcome, the

levels of 'likelihood' meet the levels of 'likelihood' specified in SA2.1.2 for each separate stock.

- SA2.2.6 For species or stocks fished as stock complexes, the overall target reference points (TRPs) shall:
- a. Be consistent with the intent of the PI and
- b. Maintain the high productivity of the stock complex.

## Consideration of environmental variability ◙

SA2.2.7 The team shall verify that reference points are consistent with ecosystem productivity.

SA2.2.7.1

If changes in fishery productivity are due to natural environmental fluctuations, the team shall accept adjustments to the reference points in scoring PI 1.1.1.

## Treatment of key low trophic level stocks

SA2.2.8 The team shall consider the trophic position of target stocks to ensure precaution in relation to their ecological role, in particular for species low in the food chain. ◙

- SA2.2.9 The team shall treat a stock under assessment against Principle 1 as a key low trophic level (LTL) stock if either a or b below are met: ◙
- a. It is one of the species types listed in Box SA1, and in its adult life-cycle phase the stock holds a key role in the ecosystem, such that it meets at least 2 of the following sub-criteria:
- i. A large proportion of the trophic connections in the ecosystem involve this stock, leading to significant predator dependency. ◙
- ii. A large volume of energy passing between lower and higher trophic levels passes through this stock. ◙
- iii. There are few other species at this trophic level through which energy can be transmitted from lower to higher trophic levels, such that a high proportion of the total energy passing between lower and higher trophic levels passes through this stock: i.e. it is a 'wasp-waisted' ecosystem. ◙
- b. It is not one of the species types listed in Box SA1, but in its adult life-cycle phase it meets at least 2 of the sub criteria in SA2.2.9a.i-iii, and the species:
- i. Feeds predominantly on plankton,
- ii. Is characterised by small body size, early maturity, high fecundity, and short life span: default values: &lt; 30cm long as adults, mean age at maturity &lt;= 2, &gt; 10,000 eggs/spawning, maximum age &lt; 10 years, respectively, and
- iii. Forms dense schools.
- SA2.2.10 The team shall provide evidence specifically addressing each of the sub-criteria in SA2.2.9 to justify any decision not to define the stock as a key LTL species in the ecosystem under assessment.

SA2.2.10.1

If information is unavailable on a sub-criterion in SA2.2.9, the team shall assume that the stock meets that sub-criterion.

SA2.2.10.2

When formulating rationales against the key LTL sub-criteria (SA2.2.9a.i-iii), the team shall:

## MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1

- a. Document the choice of spatial scale.
- b. Provide reasonable justification for the choice.

SA2.2.11 The team shall determine whether a species is to be considered a key LTL species based on its status at the time of assessment.

- SA2.2.12 The team shall score stocks identified as key LTL stocks against PI 1.1.1A instead of PI 1.1.1. ◙
- a. The team shall use Table SA2 and associated requirements SA2.2.13 to SA2.2.17 below.
- SA2.2.13 When scoring PI 1.1.1A scoring issue (a), the team shall interpret 'the point where serious ecosystem impacts could occur' as being substantially higher than the PRI. ◙
- a. Such a reference point shall not be less than 20% of the total biomass (B0) or the spawning stock level (SSB0) that would be expected in the absence of fishing.
- SA2.2.14 The team shall expect the following of key LTL species when scoring PI 1.1.1A scoring issue (b): ◙
- a. The default biomass target level consistent with ecosystem needs shall be 75% of the B0 or SSB0 that would be expected in the absence of fishing.
- b. However, a higher or lower target level, down to a minimum 40% of the B0 or SSB0 that would be expected in the absence of fishing, may still achieve an 80-level score if it can be demonstrated, using a credible ecosystem model or robust empirical data for the UoA/ecosystem being assessed, that the level adopted:
- i. Does not impact the abundance levels of more than 15% of the other species and trophic groups by more than 40% compared to their state in the absence of fishing on the target LTL species.

- ii. Does not reduce the abundance level of any single ecosystem group (species or trophic group) by more than 70% (compared to its biomass level in the absence of fishing on the target LTL species).
- SA2.2.15 At SG100 in scoring issue (b), the team shall require a higher degree of certainty when considering the ecological impact of the UoA on the stock.
- SA2.2.15.1 For key LTL species to score 100, the team shall demonstrate that biomass levels are fluctuating 'above' the 'level consistent with ecosystem needs' at SG80.
- SA2.2.16 If the team uses proxy indicators and reference points to score key LTL species at PI 1.1.1A, the team shall justify their use as reasonable proxies of stock biomass for the points where serious ecosystem impacts could occur and the level consistent with ecosystem needs. ◙
- SA2.2.16.1 Where the team uses fishing mortality rate to score stock status, the default fishing mortality required to maintain a stock fluctuating around the level consistent with ecosystem needs shall take the value of:
- a. 0.5M, where M is the natural mortality of the species, or
- b. 0.5FMSY, where the maximum rate of fishing mortality (FMSY) has been determined in a single-species context.

SA2.2.16.2 Proxy fishing mortalities required to maintain the stock above the point where serious ecosystem impacts could occur shall be lower than assumed to be able to keep the population above the point where recruitment would be impaired.

- SA2.2.16.3 Departures from these default levels may be justified if the team can demonstrate that SA2.2.14.b is met.
- SA2.2.17 The team shall judge performance against these reference points in the context of recruitment variability typical for the given species in its ecosystem. ◙

## SA2.4.1 The team shall interpret: ◙

- a. 'Responsive' at SG80 and SG100 scoring issue (a) to mean that the harvest strategy allows management to be adaptive to the development and implementation of the differing elements of the harvest strategy and action has been taken by management, when required.
- b. 'Designed' at SG100 scoring issue (a) to mean a harvest strategy that includes a management procedure (MP) that has been developed through management strategy evaluation (MSE).
- c. 'Tested' at SG80 scoring issue (b) to mean the involvement of some sort of structured logical argument and analysis that supports the choice of strategy.
- d. 'Evaluated' at SG100 scoring issue (b) to mean 'tested for robustness to uncertainty, appropriate to the scale and intensity of the UoA'.
- SA2.4.2 When setting conditions, if new harvest control rules (HCRs) or assessment methods require different or additional information, the team shall ensure that: ◙
- a. The information is already available, or
- b. The information is made part of the condition.

## Shark finning ◙

SA2.4.3 If the target species is a shark, the team shall score scoring issue (e).

- SA2.4.3.1 The team shall interpret the term 'shark' to refer to any species within the taxonomic groups Selachimorpha and Rhinopristiformes.
- SA2.4.4 At scoring issue (e) at SG60, the team shall:
- a. Determine that a fins naturally attached (FNA) policy is in place for all retained sharks.
- i. If the UoA does not retain sharks, the team shall determine that a non-retention policy is in place.
- b. Apply the Evidence Requirements Framework in Tool B of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox to establish that the information used to determine that an FNA or non-retention policy is in place and enforced has a very high degree of accuracy.

## 'Unwanted catch'

SA2.4.5 If there is 'unwanted catch' of the target P1 stock, the team shall score scoring issue (f).

SA2.4.5.1

When applying scoring issue (f) to target stocks in P1, the team shall note SA3.1.1.e (including GSA3.1.1.e), SA3.3.4 and SA3.7.2.

SA2.4.5.2

When applying scoring issue (f) to target stocks in P1, the team shall include consideration of 'alternative measures' directed at minimising mortality of 'unwanted catch' from ghost gear.

- SA2.5.1 The team should require additional precaution to be built into the HCR at SG100 so that the HCR keeps stocks well above limit reference points (LRPs).
- SA2.5.2 The team shall interpret: ◙
- a. 'Generally understood' at SG60 to mean HCRs that can be shown to have been applied in some way in the past but have not been explicitly defined or agreed.
- b. 'Well defined' at SG80 to mean HCRs exist in some written form that has been agreed by the management agency, ideally with stakeholders and state what actions will be taken at what specific TRP levels.
- c. 'In place' at SG60 and SG80 to mean the HCR has been adopted by the management agency, and/or there is evidence or documentation that management actions have been taken where required.
- SA2.5.3 In scoring issue (a) at the SG100 level, where quantitative simulation testing is available 'most of the time', the team shall interpret the stock as being maintained at or above BMSY or some ecologically more relevant target point at least 70% of the time.

## Evaluating the effectiveness of HCRs ◙

SA2.5.4 In scoring issue (c), for 'evidence' the team shall use the current levels of exploitation in the UoA, such as measured by the fishing mortality rate or harvest rate, where available.

- SA2.5.4.1 If information is not available on the exploitation rate consistent with achieving a long-term MSY, the team shall provide justification where available proxy indicators and reference points are used as reasonable proxies of the exploitation rate.

## SA3 Principle 2 ◙

Figure SA2: Principle 2 default assessment tree

<!-- image -->

## SA3.1 General requirements for Principle 2 ◙

SA3.1.1 The team shall interpret the following terms used in Principle 2 as follows:

- a. 'Does not hinder recovery' means the impact of the UoA is low enough that if the status of the species can improve, the UoA will not hinder that improvement.
- b. 'In place' means the measure, partial strategy, strategy, or comprehensive strategy has been fully implemented in the UoA.
- c. 'Minimise' means reduce to lowest achievable level.
- i. In determining the lowest achievable level, the team shall consider the requirements of each component.
- d. 'Negligible' has two specific definitions depending on the taxa of a species: ◙
- i. For amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles (out-of-scope species), negligible means the average estimates of total mortality from the UoA are less than 10 individuals per year, and the lower bound of estimated breeding population size is equal to or greater than 5,000 individuals.
- ii. For fish or invertebrate species, negligible means the UoA mortalities represent less than 2% of total UoA catch, except where the total catch of the UoA is exceptionally large. ◙
- e. 'Unwanted catch' is the part of the catch that the UoA did not intend to catch but could not avoid and did not want or chose not to use. ◙

## SA3.2 Identification and categorisation of Principle 2 species

SA3.2.1 The team shall identify and list all species with which the UoA has a documented interaction. ◙

## Step 1 - Habitats categorisation

SA3.2.2 The team shall categorise any invertebrate species that is benthic-habitat forming as a scoring element under the habitats component, irrespective of the species endangered, threatened or protected (ETP) status and irrespective of its catch proportions.

## Step 2 - Identify species with 'negligible' interactions

SA3.2.3 The team shall determine if the UoA's interactions with any of the species identified and listed as per SA3.2.1 meet the definitions of 'negligible' in SA3.1.1.d. ◙

SA3.2.3.1

If there is insufficient information to determine whether the UoA's interaction with a species is 'negligible' as per SA3.1.1.d, the team shall not categorise the interaction as 'negligible'.

SA3.2.3.2

If the team categorises the UoA's interaction with a species as 'negligible', the team shall not assess this species as a scoring element unless either of the following apply:

- a. The species is a marine mammal and intentional harassment or intentional killing of that species is an integral part of the fishing operation as per SA3.9.3, or
- b. The team decides to score all species with which the UoA has a 'negligible' interaction for a given component. ◙

SA3.2.3.3 The team shall list all species whose UoA interaction is categorised as 'negligible' in the 'MSC Reporting Template' and the 'MSC Surveillance Reporting Template'.

## Step 3 - Categorisation

SA3.2.4 The team shall follow SA3.2.5 - SA3.2.10, and the decision tree in Figure SA3, to categorise all remaining species (i.e. those species whose UoA interaction was not categorised as negligible as per SA3.2.3) as scoring elements under one of the following Principle 2 components: ◙

- a. In-scope species
- b. ETP/Out-Of-Scope (OOS) species
- c. Habitats

SA3.2.4.1 If the fishery assessment comprises more than one UoA, the team shall not categorise the P1 species from the other UoA(s) as a scoring element under Principle 2.

## Step 4 - ETP/OOS categorisation check one

- SA3.2.5 The team shall categorise a species as a scoring element under the ETP/OOS species component if:
- a. The species is classified as an amphibian, reptile, bird or mammal (OOS species), or
- b. The species is classified as a fish or invertebrate and is listed in any of the following:
- i. Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix 1.
- ii. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix 1.
- iii. CITES Appendix 2, if the species concerned are not permitted to be exported and traded by the relevant management authorities.

- iv. International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) and classified globally as 'Critically Endangered (Cr)' (except when the assessment is determined to be 'needing update' as defined by the IUCN).
- v. A chondrichthyan on the IUCN Red List and classified globally as 'Endangered (En)' or 'Critically Endangered (Cr)' (regardless of whether the assessment is determined to be 'needing update').

SA3.2.6 The team shall not modify the categorisation of a species that has been categorised as a scoring element under the ETP/OOS species component using the criteria listed in SA3.2.5.

## Step 5 - ETP/OOS categorisation check two

SA3.2.7 The team shall categorise a species as a scoring element under the ETP/OOS species component if the species is listed on any of the following:

- a. CMS Appendix 2.
- b. CITES Appendix 2 if the species concerned are permitted to be exported and traded by the relevant management authorities.
- c. IUCN Red List classified globally as 'En'.
- d. IUCN Red List classified globally as 'Cr' if the assessment is determined to be 'needing update' as defined by the IUCN.
- e. National ETP legislation, except where legislation allows managed fisheries to target that species ◙

SA3.2.8 The team shall determine if the categorisation of a species as a scoring element under the ETP/OOS component following SA3.2.7, is eligible for modification as per SA3.2.9.

## Step 6 - Modification criteria

- SA3.2.9

The team may modify the categorisation of a species as a scoring element under the ETP/OOS species component (determined as per SA3.2.7) to a scoring element under the in-scope species component if at least 2 of the following modification criteria are met:

- a. Life history characteristics: the species is inherently resilient to exploitation as demonstrated by high productivity attributes.
- i. The team shall determine that this criterion is met if the stock/species achieves a productivity score of less than 2, using Table A8 in the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox.
- b. Management status: the stock is subject to measures or management tools, reflected in either LRPs or TRPs (or equivalent), intended to achieve stock management objectives in response to directed exploitation.
- c. Stock status: the stock is at a level that maintains high productivity.
- i. The team shall determine that this criterion is met if the stock is at or fluctuating around a level consistent with MSY, consistent with achieving SG80 for PI 1.1.1, scoring issue (b).
- ii. The team shall make this determination using information from stock assessment(s) that have been subject to peer review, consistent with achieving SG80 for PI 1.2.4, scoring issue (e).
- SA3.2.9.1 For species listed as per SA3.2.7.d, the team shall only modify their categorisation if the information used to determine if the modification criteria are met is more recent than the IUCN assessment.

## Step 7 - 'In-scope' categorisation

- SA3.2.10 The team shall categorise a species as a scoring element under the in-scope species component if:
- a. The species is not assessed under Principle 1.
- b. The species is not categorised as a scoring element under the ETP/OOS species component.
- c. The categorisation of the species has been modified as per SA3.2.9.
- d. The species is used as bait in the UoA, whether caught by the UoA or purchased from elsewhere. ◙

## Step 8 - Confirm categorisation

- SA3.2.11 The team shall provide a list of all Principle 2 scoring elements in the 'MSC Reporting Template'.
- SA3.2.11.1 The team shall include the following:
- a. The scientific name for each species.
- b. Details of different stocks if assessed as separate scoring elements.
- c. The component under which the scoring element will be assessed.
- d. The rationale for the categorisation.
- e. The rationale for any modification of scoring element categorisation from the ETP/OOS species component to the in-scope species component.

SA3.2.12 The team shall score each Principle 2 species as a scoring element under the component to which it is assigned.

## SA3.3 General requirements for outcome PIs ◙

SA3.3.1 The team shall interpret definitions of required probability in Principle 2 as per Table SA8. ◙

SA3.3.2 If there are no scoring elements under a particular component, the team shall award a score of 100 for the Outcome PI.

SA3.3.3

The team shall still score the Management and Information PIs.

SA3.3.4

When scoring the Outcome PIs in Principle 2, the team shall assess observed and unobserved mortality, including from ghost gear impacts. ◙

SA3.3.4.1

The team shall document the assessment of observed and unobserved mortality in the scoring rationales.

## SA3.4 General requirements for management PIs ◙

SA3.4.1 The team shall interpret:

- a. 'Measures' to mean actions or tools that explicitly manage impacts on the component or indirectly contribute to management of the component under assessment having been designed to manage impacts elsewhere.
- b. 'Partial strategy' to mean a cohesive arrangement that may comprise 1 or more measures, an understanding of how the measures work to achieve an outcome and an awareness of the need to change the measures should they cease to be effective. A 'partial strategy' may not have been designed to manage the impact on that component specifically.
- c. 'Strategy' to mean a cohesive and strategic arrangement that may comprise 1 or more measures and an understanding of how the measures work to achieve an outcome. A 'strategy' should be designed to manage impact on that component specifically, it needs to be appropriate to the scale, intensity, and cultural context of the fishery and should contain mechanisms for the modification of fishing practices if unacceptable impacts are identified.
- d. 'Comprehensive strategy' to mean a complete and tested strategy made up of linked monitoring, analyses, and management measures and responses. The term is only applicable to the ETP/OOS species component.

## SA3.5 General requirements for information PIs ◙

SA3.5.1 The team shall interpret 'information adequate to support a strategy' at SG100 to include information provided by a strategic research plan that addresses the information needs of management, beyond the immediate short-term management needs, to create a strategic body of research relevant to the long-term fishery-specific management system.

- a. The catch of a species by the UoA comprises 5% or more by weight of the total catch of all species by the UoA, or
- b. The species is classified as 'less resilient' and the catch of the species by the UoA comprises 2% or more by weight of the total catch of all species by the UoA, or: ◙
- i. The team shall identify a species as 'less resilient' if:
- A. The productivity of the species indicates that it is intrinsically of low resilience, and/or

SA3.7.2 If there is 'unwanted catch' as defined in SA3.1.1.e, the team shall score scoring issue (c). ◙

- SA3.7.2.1 The team shall interpret 'alternative measures' as alternative fishing gear and/or practices (i.e. those not already used in the UoA prior to the review) that have been shown to 'minimise' incidental observed and/or unobserved mortality of the species or species type to the lowest achievable levels. ◙
- a. The team shall only consider 'alternative measures' directed at 'minimising' mortality of 'unwanted catch' from ghost gear in scoring issue (e).

SA3.7.2.2 The team shall verify that a review includes consideration of the potential effectiveness and practicality of 'alternative measures'. ◙

- SA3.7.2.3 The team shall interpret 'implemented as appropriate' as situations where potential 'alternative measures' reviewed are: ◙
- a. Determined to be more effective at minimising the mortality of 'unwanted catch' than current fishing gear and practices.
- b. Determined to be comparable to existing measures in terms of effect on target species catch and impacts on vessel and crew safety.
- c. Determined to not negatively impact other species or habitats.
- d. Not cost prohibitive to implement.

## Shark finning

SA3.7.3

If the in-scope species is a shark, the team shall score scoring issue (d) following SA2.4.3 - SA2.4.4.

SA3.7.4

If the only UoA interactions with sharks are categorised as 'negligible' as per SA3.2.3, the team shall score scoring issue (d) following SA2.4.3 - SA2.4.4, regardless of the ETP status of these sharks.

## Ghost gear management strategy ◙

SA3.7.5

The team shall only score scoring issue (e) if PI 2.2.2 scoring issue (e) is not scored (i.e. if there are no ETP/OOS scoring elements).

SA3.7.6 The term 'if necessary', at all scoring guideposts, refers to whether the risk of ghost fishing or ghost gear impacts is demonstrably absent. ◙

SA3.7.6.1 If the risk of ghost gear impacts is demonstrably absent the team shall award a

score of SG100 for scoring issue (e).

SA3.7.7

The team shall justify how the measures/partial strategy/strategy are expected to 'minimise' ghost gear and its impacts.

SA3.7.8 The team shall interpret 'expected to minimise' to mean 'measures'/'partial strategy'/'strategy' that will contribute to minimising ghost gear and its impacts. ◙

## SA3.9.1 The team shall identify the ETP/OOS unit(s). ◙

SA3.9.1.1 The team shall identify the ETP/OOS unit(s) on the basis of either:

- a. Biological distinctiveness (defined by any genetic, life history, behavioural, or morphological characteristics), or
- b. Conservation and management purposes (defined based on geographic boundaries but drawing on biological information).

SA3.9.1.2 The team shall consider biology and distribution of the ETP/OOS unit relative to the scale and intensity of the UoA, as per SA3.9.1.1.

SA3.9.1.3 If organisations responsible for assessing the status of species have identified specific ETP/OOS units in order to assess impacts of the UoA or wider fleet that meet the requirements in SA3.9.1.1 and SA3.9.1.2, the team shall select these units as the ETP/OOS unit.

- SA3.9.1.4 If organisations responsible for assessing the status of species have not identified

specific ETP/OOS units in order to assess impacts of the UoA or wider fleet, or those units do not meet the requirements in SA3.9.1.1 and SA3.9.1.2, the team shall select the most relevant unit for assessing the impacts of the UoA on the population, following SA3.9.1.1 and SA3.9.1.2.

SA3.9.1.5 The team shall list each ETP/OOS unit identified.

SA3.9.1.6 The team shall score each ETP/OOS unit as a separate scoring element.

SA3.9.1.7 The team shall justify the selection of each ETP/OOS unit.

SA3.9.2

The team shall evaluate the likelihood that the UoA does not hinder recovery of the ETP/OOS unit to favourable conservation status through the review of quantitative assessment(s) that determine the impact of the UoA with respect to favourable conservation status. ◙

SA3.9.2.1

The team shall consider favourable conservation status to be a level equivalent to at least 50% carrying capacity unless the team has defined a higher level based on the life history characteristics of the ETP/OOS unit.

SA3.9.2.2

If the following reference points are specified and are set at a level of at least 50% carrying capacity, the team shall consider the reference point equivalent to favourable conservation status:

- a. Optimum Sustainable Population.
- b. Maximum Net Productivity Level.
- c. Maximum Sustained Fishing Mortality.
- d. Fishing Mortality or Biomass-based reference points.

SA3.9.2.3 The team shall evaluate whether the UoA would hinder recovery (as defined in SA3.1.1) of the ETP/OOS unit to favourable conservation status within a timeframe of 3 generations or 100 years, whichever is shorter.

## Intentional harassment of marine mammals

SA3.9.3 At the SG80 level for scoring issue (a), if the ETP/OOS unit is a marine mammal and intentional harassment or intentional killing of that ETP/OOS unit is an integral part of the fishing operation, the team shall verify that the ETP/OOS unit is estimated to be at or above favourable conservation status with a 'high degree of certainty' (as per Table SA8).

◙

- SA3.9.3.1 The team shall verify the status of the ETP/OOS unit using a quantitative estimate of the population size within the last 5 years that has been:
- a. Produced by an independent research organisation or has been independently verified, and
- b. Made publicly available.
- SA3.9.3.2 The team shall interpret the term 'intentional' to mean any action that is not deemed to be 'incidental' to fishing operations. ◙
- a. The team shall interpret the term 'incidental' to mean consequences or results that were neither intended nor anticipated.
- SA3.9.3.3 The team shall interpret the term 'harassment' to mean any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance that has the potential to:
- a. Injure a marine mammal, or
- b. Disturb a marine mammal by causing disruption of behavioural patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering.
- SA3.9.3.4 The team shall interpret the term 'integral part' to mean a tactical or necessary part of the fishing operation of any vessel within the UoA.
- a. The team shall interpret the term 'tactical' to mean actions instituted by the UoA whilst undertaking fishing operations (e.g. deploying or hauling fishing gear) that either make use of (e.g. used to help facilitate capture of target species), or target (e.g. pursue or encircle) marine mammals.
- b. The team shall interpret the term 'necessary' to mean actions required, or expected, to maximise catch or its efficiency.

If the team trigger SA3.9.3 for an ETP/OOS unit, the maximum score the team shall

SA3.9.3.5 award for that unit is SG80.

- SA3.9.3.6 The team shall apply SA3.9.3 irrespective of:
- a. Whether the UoA impact on the ETP/OOS unit is determined to be 'negligible' as per SA3.1.1.d.
- b. Whether the RBF is triggered for the relevant ETP/OOS unit.
- c. Whether the client, or entities within the client group, are permitted to intentionally kill or harass marine mammals (i.e. through permits or other types of allowances).

SA3.9.4 If there are no ETP/OOS scoring elements, the team shall award a score of SG100 for scoring issue (a).

SA3.10.1 In scoring issue (a), if there are no ETP/OOS scoring elements the team shall apply the term 'if necessary'.

SA3.10.1.1 The team shall award a score of SG80 for scoring issue (a).

SA3.10.1.2 The team shall still assess SG100 for scoring issue (a).

SA3.10.2 In scoring issue (a), the team shall interpret 'measures'/'strategy'/'comprehensive strategy' to include measures that are expected to 'minimise' mortalities through:

- a.  Spatial and/or temporal gear restrictions or closures, or
- b.  Modification of fishing gears and practices, or
- c. Maximising the live release of individuals while ensuring the safety of the fishing crew.
- SA3.10.2.1 The team shall justify how these measures are expected to minimise the UoArelated mortality based on at least 1 of the following:
- a. The use of best practice mitigation measures, if these have demonstrably achieved minimisation of mortalities of a species with a specific gear type.
- b. Comparison with similar fisheries and species (similar gear, area of operation, and interactions with the ETP/OOS unit).
- c. From trials or application in the UoA itself.
- SA3.10.3 In scoring issue (b), the team shall:
- a. Review evidence, and
- b. Provide a rationale on the effectiveness of the 'measures', 'strategy', or 'comprehensive strategy' in achieving the objective of reducing or minimising the mortality of the ETP/OOS unit.
- SA3.10.3.1 The team shall interpret 'minimised' to mean when both of the following are met:
- a. The ETP/OOS unit score meets at least the SG80 for PI 2.2.1 scoring issue (a) or achieves a score of 80 or above when the RBF (MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox, Tool A) is used.

- b. The ETP/OOS unit score meets the SG100 for PI 2.2.2 scoring issue (a).

SA3.10.3.2 The team shall interpret 'reduced' to mean when either of the following are met:

- a. A clear trend showing a decline in mortalities due to the implementation of measures described in SA3.10.2 since the measures were introduced.
- b. A reduction in mortality rate relative to the population size of the ETP/OOS unit.

## Reviewing 'alternative measures' for ETP/OOS species

SA3.10.4 The team shall score scoring issue (c) unless there are no ETP/OOS scoring elements.

SA3.10.4.1 The team shall interpret 'alternative measures' as alternative fishing gear and practices (i.e. those not already used in the UoA prior to the review) that meet the criteria for 'measures' that are expected to minimise mortality as per SA3.10.2.1.

The team shall interpret 'implemented as appropriate for the ETP/OOS unit' as

SA3.10.4.2 situations where potential 'alternative measures' reviewed:

- a. Are more effective at minimising the mortality of the ETP/OOS unit than the current fishing gear and practices.
- b. Are comparable to existing measures in terms of effect on target species catch, and impacts on vessel and crew safety.
- c. Do not negatively impact other species or habitats.

## Shark finning

SA3.10.5 If the ETP species is a shark, the team shall score scoring issue (d) following SA2.4.3SA2.4.4.

## Ghost gear management strategy

SA3.10.6 In scoring issue (e), the team shall apply SA3.7.6 to SA3.7.8.

SA3.10.6.1 The team shall only assess scoring issue (e) if there are ETP/OOS scoring elements.

- SA3.12.1 The team shall assess the habitats component in relation to the effects of the UoA on the structure and function of the habitats impacted by the UoA. ◙
- a.  The team shall score each habitat as a separate scoring element.
- b. If there is insufficient information for assessment of PI 2.3.1, the team shall use the RBF Consequence Spatial Analysis (CSA) (as defined by A2.1.2 in the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox).
- c.  The team may use the RBF CSA even if there is sufficient information to assess PI 2.3.1.

If a benthic habitat is being assessed, the team shall recognise habitats based on the following habitat characteristics: ◙

- a.  Substratum - sediment type.
- b.  Geomorphology - seafloor topography.
- c.  Biota - characteristic floral and/or faunal group(s).

The team shall determine and justify which habitats impacted by the UoA are 'less sensitive' or 'more sensitive', as follows: ◙

- a.  The team shall interpret 'less sensitive' as a habitat that would be able to recover to at least 80% of its unimpacted structure and function within 20 years if fishing were to cease entirely.
- b.  The team shall interpret 'more sensitive" as a habitat that would be unable to recover to at least 80% of its unimpacted structure and function within 20 years if fishing were to cease entirely.
- SA3.12.3.1

The team shall recognise habitats designated as FAO Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) as 'more sensitive' habitats. ◙

- SA3.12.3.2 The team shall determine whether a habitat is 'less' or 'more sensitive',

irrespective of its protection status.

- SA3.12.4 In the case of 'less sensitive' habitats, the team shall interpret 'serious or irreversible harm' as reductions in habitat structure and function, such that the habitat would be unable to recover at least 80% of its hypothetical climax state within 20 years if fishing on the habitat were to cease entirely. ◙

SA3.12.5 In the case of 'more sensitive' habitats, the team shall interpret 'serious or irreversible harm' as reductions in habitat structure and function below 80% of the unimpacted state.

◙

SA3.12.6

When assessing the status of habitats and the impacts of fishing, the team shall consider the full area managed by the local, regional, national, or international body(ies) responsible for fisheries management in the area(s) where the UoA operates, otherwise known as the 'managed area'. ◙

SA3.12.6.1

The team shall use all available information (e.g. bioregional information) to determine the range and distribution of the habitat under consideration.

SA3.12.6.2

The team shall use all available information to determine whether this distribution is entirely within the 'managed area' or extends beyond the 'managed area'.

SA3.12.6.3

If a habitat's range falls entirely within the 'managed area', the team shall consider the habitat's range inside the 'managed area'.

SA3.12.6.4

If a habitat's range extends beyond the 'managed area', the team shall consider the habitat's range both inside and outside the 'managed area'. ◙

SA3.13.1 In scoring issues (a) and (b), if there are no habitat scoring elements the team shall apply the term 'if necessary'.

SA3.13.1.1 The team shall award a score of SG80 for scoring issues (a) and (b).

SA3.13.1.2 The team shall still assess SG100 for scoring issues (a) and (b).

SA3.13.2 The team shall consider the differences between 'measures', 'partial strategy', and 'strategy' as they apply to habitat management. ◙

- SA3.13.2.1

In scoring issue (a) at the SG60 and SG80 levels, the 'measures' or 'partial strategy' respectively, for a UoA that encounters 'more sensitive' habitats shall include, at a minimum: ◙

- a. Requirements to comply with management 'measures' to protect 'more sensitive' habitats.

- b. Implementation by the UoA of precautionary measures to avoid encounters with 'more sensitive' habitats and avoid potential serious or irreversible harm.

SA3.13.2.2 In scoring issue (a) at the SG100 level: ◙

- a. The 'strategy' for a UoA that encounters 'more sensitive' habitats shall include a comprehensive management plan that is supported by a comprehensive impact assessment that determines that all fishing activities will not cause serious or irreversible harm to 'more sensitive' habitats.
- b. A management 'strategy' shall be in place for all UoAs, including those that do not regularly contact benthic habitats, because gear loss or unexpected benthic impact could occur.

SA3.13.3 The team shall only score scoring issue (c) if:

- a.  The UoA impacts a 'more sensitive' habitat, and/or
- b.  Another MSC UoA or non-MSC fishery, where relevant, impacts a 'more sensitive' habitat within the UoA's 'managed area' (as defined in SA3.12.6).
- SA3.13.3.1 In scoring issue (c), the team shall assess the adequacy of the information available to understand (SG60)/determine (SG80 and SG100) the extent to which the UoA complies with:
- a. Management requirements that apply directly to the UoA, and
- b. Precautionary protection measures implemented by other MSC UoAs and nonMSC fisheries, 'where relevant'.
- SA3.13.3.2 The team shall not consider levels of compliance in scoring issue (c), but rather the

information available to determine this.

- SA3.13.3.3

In determining 'where relevant', the team shall consider and document: ◙

- a. Areas where closure is clearly aimed at precautionary protection of more sensitive habitats, based on scientific rationale and best practice. The team shall not include closures that are designed for other purposes.
- b. Avoidance of closed areas arising from move-on rules and consideration of other 'measures' implemented by all MSC UoAs.
- c. Avoidance of any relevant move-on areas implemented by non-MSC fisheries if the area coordinates are available.

SA3.13.4 In scoring issue (c), the team shall apply the Evidence Requirements Framework in Tool B of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox to determine which guidepost is met.

## Ghost gear management strategy

SA3.13.5 In scoring issue (d), the team shall apply SA3.7.6 to SA3.7.8.

- SA3.15.2 The team shall identify and describe the assessed ecosystem in relation to the spatial and

temporal scale of the UoA and its intensity.

SA3.15.3

SA3.15.4

The team shall identify and assess all relevant key ecosystem elements on which the UoA has an impact.

The team shall interpret 'key' ecosystem elements as: ◙

- a.  The features of an ecosystem considered most crucial to the ecosystem's characteristic nature and dynamics.
- b.  The features most crucial to maintaining the integrity of its structure and functions and the key determinants of its resilience and productivity.
- SA3.15.5 The team shall identify whether the UoA impact on key ecosystem element(s) includes indirect effects on ETP/OOS units. ◙

SA3.15.5.1

The team shall evaluate whether any identified indirect impacts are 'likely' to hinder the recovery of the ETP/OOS unit.

SA3.15.5.2

If it is determined that indirect impacts are 'likely' to hinder recovery of ETP/OOS units, the team shall consider this to be evidence that the UoA is 'likely' to disrupt the key elements underlying ecosystem structure and function to a point where there would be serious or irreversible harm.

SA3.15.6 The team shall ensure that any qualitative analysis and/or expert judgements used to score a UoA at SG60 and SG80 are approximately equivalent to the quantitative probability interpretation in SA3.3.1 and Table SA8.

SA3.15.6.1 The team shall provide justification for equivalence.

SA3.15.6.2

The team shall use a range of informed viewpoints or alternative hypotheses to make qualitative judgements about the probability interpretation of the SG.

- SA4.1.3 The team shall not individually assess the performance of other fisheries' management bodies where they are also subject to international cooperation to manage the stock, except where they impact directly on P1 and P2 outcomes and/or P3 implementation. ◙

- SA4.1.4 The team shall provide, in the rationale, evidence demonstrating the validity and robustness of the conclusions for scores that are based on the consideration of informal or traditional management systems.
- SA4.1.4.1 The team shall obtain this evidence by: ◙
- a. Using different methods to collect information.
- b. Cross-checking opinions and views from different segments of the stakeholder community.
- SA4.1.5 The team shall consider the scale and intensity of the UoA in determining the appropriateness of the management system.

- SA4.3.1 At the SG60 level for scoring issue (a), the team shall interpret 'compatibility of laws or standards with effective management' as follows:
- a. For a UoA not subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, this means:
- i. The existence of national laws, agreements, and policies governing the actions of all the authorities and actors involved in managing the UoA.
- ii. That these laws, agreements, and/or policies provide a framework for cooperation between national entities on national management issues, as appropriate for the context, size, scale, or intensity of the UoA.
- b. For a UoA subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, for example, shared, straddling, HMS, and high seas non-HMS, this means:

- SA4.3.1.1
- i. The fishery is not conducted under a 'controversial' 'unilateral' 'exemption' to an 'international agreement', and ◙
- ii. National and international laws, arrangements, agreements, and policies exist that govern the actions of the authorities and actors involved in managing the UoA, and
- iii. A framework for cooperation with other territories, sub-regional, or regional fisheries management organisations exists, or
- iv. Other bilateral/multilateral arrangements exist that create the cooperation required to deliver sustainable management under the obligations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Articles 63(2), 64, 118, and 119, and the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) Article 8.
- Cooperation shall at least deliver the intent of UNFSA Article 10 paragraphs relating

to: ◙

- a. The collection and sharing of scientific data.
- b. The scientific assessment of stock status.
- c. Development of scientific advice.
- SA4.3.1.2 The flag state of participants in the UoA shall have at least cooperating nonmember status within a relevant sub-regional or regional fisheries management organisation, or another bilateral/multilateral arrangement, if such exists.
- SA4.3.2 At the SG80 level for scoring issue (a), the team shall interpret 'compatibility of laws or standards with effective management' as follows:
- a. For a UoA not subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, this means:
- i. The existence of national laws, agreements, and policy governing the actions of all the authorities and actors involved in managing the UoA.
- ii. That these laws, agreements, and/or policies also provide for organised cooperation between national entities on national management issues; for example, between regional and national management, state and federal management, indigenous, and other groups.
- b. For a UoA subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, this means: ◙
- i. The existence of national and international laws, agreements and policies governing the actions of the authorities and actors involved in managing the UoA.
- ii. That effective regional and/or international cooperation creates a comprehensive cooperation under the obligations of UNCLOS Articles 63(2), 64, 118, 119, and UNFSA Article 8.
- iii. That cooperation shall at least deliver the intent of UNFSA Article 10 paragraphs relating to the collection, sharing, and dissemination of scientific data; the scientific assessment of stock status and development of management advice; the agreement and delivery of management actions consistent with this sustainable management advice; and on monitoring and control.
- iv. That the flag state of fishery participants in the UoA shall be members of the relevant organisation or participants in the arrangement, or agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by the organisation or arrangement, if such organisation or arrangement exists.
- SA4.3.3 At the SG100 level for scoring issue (a), the team shall interpret 'compatibility of laws or standards with effective management' as follows: ◙
- a. For a UoA not subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, this means:

- SA4.3.3.1
- i. National laws, agreements, and policies governing the actions of all the authorities and actors involved in managing the UoA.
- ii. That these laws, agreements, and/or policies also provide for a formal system for cooperation between national entities; for example, between regional and national management, state and federal management, indigenous, and other groups.
- b. For a UoA subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, this means:
- i. The existence of national laws, agreements, and policies governing the actions of the authorities and actors involved in managing the UoA.
- ii. That binding legislation exists governing comprehensive international cooperation under the obligations of UNCLOS Articles 63(2), 64, 118, 119, and UNFSA Articles 8 and 10.
- iii. That cooperation under the regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO)/arrangement, and the actions of the RFMO, shall demonstrably and effectively deliver UNFSA Article 10.
- The team shall interpret across SGs 60, 80, and 100 that 'effective national legal system' means that the client can provide objective evidence that most of the essential features and elements needed to deliver sustainable fisheries are present in:
- a. A coherent, logical set of practices or procedures, or
- b. Within a coherent, logical, supporting, 'rule-making' structure.
- SA4.3.4 At the SG60 level for scoring issue (b), the team shall expect that the UoA is not subject to disputes that overwhelm the fishery enough to prevent it from meeting the objectives of MSC Principle 1 and Principle 2. ◙
- SA4.3.5 For scoring issue (c), the team shall not make its own judgements or unilateral decisions about whether or not custom or national treaties relating to aboriginal or indigenous people have conferred rights upon any particular group or individual.
- SA4.3.5.1 The use of the term 'treaties' shall not include international treaties, or treaties between states or nations, and is limited in this context to national treaties relating specifically to aboriginal or indigenous people. ◙
- SA4.3.6 The team shall interpret 'generally respect' in scoring issue (c) at SG60 to mean that there is some evidence that the legal and/or customary framework for managing fisheries considers the legal rights created explicitly or established by custom of people dependent on fishing for food or livelihood, and their long-term interests.
- SA4.3.7 The team shall interpret 'observe' in scoring issue (c) at SG80 to mean that:
- a. There are more-formal arrangements such as bylaws or regulations that make explicit the requirement to consider the legal rights created explicitly or by custom of people dependent on fishing for food or livelihood.
- b. Those people's long-term interests are taken into account within the legal and/or customary framework for managing fisheries.
- SA4.3.8 The team shall interpret 'formally commit' in scoring issue (c) at SG100 to mean that the client can demonstrate a mandated legal basis where rights are fully codified within the fishery management system, and/or its policies and procedures for managing fisheries under a legal framework.

## Scoring stock status

SC2.2.1 In scoring PI 1.1.1 for salmon fisheries, the level of the LRPs and TRPs shall be consistent with the intent in SA PI 1.1.1 for the outcome PIs. ◙

SC2.2.1.1

The LRP shall be a level at which the SMU has a high probability of:

- a. Persistence in the presence of directed fishing.
- b. Recovery to high production in the absence of directed fishing.

SC2.2.1.2 The TRP, generally expressed as a target escapement goal or target harvest rate, shall be a level at which the SMU maintains high production, such as BEGs or SMSY.

SC2.2.2 In an enhanced fishery, the team shall assess status based solely on the wild salmon in the SMU. ◙

SC2.2.2.1

The team shall not include artificially produced fish when assessing spawning escapement goals, or other surrogate reference points. ◙

SC2.2.2.2

If no distinction is made between wild fish and artificially produced fish in estimates of spawning escapements or other surrogate reference points, the team shall score stock status lower than in cases where wild fish are enumerated separately.

SC2.2.3 The team shall consider the following in scoring PI 1.1.1 for salmon, reflecting the periodic recruitment patterns of these species. ◙

SC2.2.3.1

Stock status: taking into consideration the specific dynamics of salmon stocks, the fishery shall meet the SG60 requirement in PI 1.1.1 scoring issue (a) if the average SMU spawning stock size is above the LRP.

SC2.2.3.2

SC2.2.3.3

The terms 'likely', 'highly likely', and 'high degree of certainty' are used to allow for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Where time-series data are available, the team shall interpret:

- a. 'Likely' to mean ≥ 60% of the 15 most recent years (≥ 9 of the 15 years).
- b. 'Highly likely' to mean ≥ 80% of the 15 most recent years (≥ 12 of the 15 years).
- c. 'High degree of certainty' to mean &gt; 90% of the 15 most recent years.

Stock status in relation to TRPs: in scoring issue (b) of PI 1.1.1, where time-series data is available, the team shall interpret:

- a. 'Fluctuating around' at the SG80 level to mean an SMU meeting its TRP in ≥ 50% of the 15 most recent years (≥ 8 of the 15 years).
- b. A 'high degree of certainty' at the SG100 level to mean that the SMU has met its TRP in ≥ 80% of the15 most recent years (≥ 12 of the 15 years).
- SC2.2.3.4 Status of component populations: scoring issue (c) allows for qualitative and/or quantitative analysis. If population-specific reference points are neither defined, nor individual populations monitored, the team may make a reasoned argument based on expert judgement and qualitative information to score this scoring issue.
- a.  Fishing should allow for the persistence of component populations, recognising that at any point in time there are 'likely' to be some populations at low and high productivity in the absence of fishing.

SC2.2.4 SA2.2.2-SA2.2.7 shall also apply.

## SC5 Allowances for inseparable or practicably inseparable catches in salmon fisheries

## SC5.1 Inseparable or practicably inseparable catches in salmon fisheries

- SC5.1.1 The CAB shall only treat catches of salmon stock as inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI), as per FCP 7.5.12, if they are not certified separately and are either:
- a. Non-target species (scored in P2, not P1), or
- b. Non-local stocks of species targeted in the fishery (stocks that are caught in the fishery but do not breed within the UoA and are not therefore normally scored as part of the SMU).

If the proposed IPI stock is a different salmon species to the target species

- SC5.1.1.1 (SC5.1.1.a), the CAB shall:
- a. Only consider it not commercially feasible to separate the species when the total catches from the IPI stock(s) do not exceed 5% by weight of the total combined catches of target and IPI stock(s) within the UoA.
- b. Assess the proposed IPI stock under P2 in accordance with FCP Annex PA.
- SC5.1.1.2 If the proposed IPI stocks are non-local stocks of the same species as the P1 target stock within the UoA (SC5.1.1.b):
- a. The total catches from the IPI stock(s) shall not exceed 5% by weight of the total combined catches of target and IPI stock(s) within the UoA.
- b. FCP 7.5.12.1.d shall not apply to these stocks. However, if these stocks are outside biologically based limits, the CAB shall demonstrate that the fishery:
- i. Does not catch 30% or more of the total removal of the stock.
- ii. Is 'highly likely' not to significantly hinder (consistent with GSA3.7) the stock's recovery.
- iii. Has implemented practical measures to reduce impacts on the stock.
- SC5.1.2 In considering whether proposed IPI stocks meet the defined 5% upper catch limits (SC5.1.1.1 and SC5.1.1.2), the CAB shall take into account catch data from the most recent 2 or more years prior to the date on which the eligibility is decided, as necessary to allow for the normal age at spawning of each of the species under consideration. ◙
- SC5.1.3 If the CAB identifies IPI stocks that are below the level of 5% specified in SC5.1.1.1.a and SC5.1.1.2.a, the CAB shall follow IPI requirements in the FCP (7.5.13 and Annex PA).
- SC5.1.3.1 The CAB shall upload an announcement to the MSC database for publication on the MSC website, using the 'MSC IPI Announcement Template,' to inform stakeholders and the MSC of the identification of IPI stock(s).

## Section SD: Introduced species-based fisheries - normative

Modifications to the default assessment tree structure to be used in Introduced Species Based Fisheries (ISBF) assessments.

## SD1 General ◙

## SD1.1 General requirements

SD1.1.1 In all ISBF assessments, the team shall apply Section SD as a supplement to Section SA.

SD1.1.1.1

'Introduced species' are defined as per Table 2.

SD1.1.1.2

This Section includes only additions and modifications in relevant sections of the default assessment tree and requirements.

## SD2 Principle 1

## SD2.1 General requirements for Principle 1

SD2.1.1 The team shall consider the ecological role of the introduced species.

SD2.1.2 The team shall assess the ISBF against default PISGs in Principle 1. ◙

SD2.1.2.1 If necessary, the team shall make modifications to the scoring issues at PI 1.1.1

and PI 1.2.2 for fisheries that include setting TRPs at levels that may be lower than MSY, to reduce biodiversity impact.

- a. The team shall not accept LRPs set at levels below which there is an appreciable risk of impairing reproductive capacity.

## SD3 Principle 2

## SD3.1 General requirements for Principle 2

SD3.1.1

The team shall determine whether the introduced species is not the target species in the fishery being considered for certification but is an in-scope species that is impacted in some way by fishing activity on the target species.

SD3.1.1.1

If the in-scope introduced species is being managed for high productivity because it is a target species in another managed fishery, the team shall evaluate the fishery to determine whether its impact on the in-scope introduced species is acceptable.

SD3.1.1.2

If the in-scope introduced species is subject to a formal or informal eradication policy because it is considered to have a 'nuisance' status, the team shall not take the impact of the fishery on the introduced species into consideration in the assessment.

SD3.1.2 The team shall assess measures in place in the fishery to prevent further ecosystem impacts that may have occurred as a result of the introduction of the species to the new location under the ecosystem component of Principle 2. ◙

SD3.1.2.1

If relevant, the team shall add an additional scoring issue and corresponding guideposts at 60, 80, and 100 levels to the ecosystem management PI 2.4.2, to evaluate measures in the fishery to prevent progression of further ecosystem impacts from occurring as a result of the presence of the introduced species.

SD3.1.2.2

The team shall review the following measures when assessing this additional scoring issue:

- a. Setting TRPs at levels that allow for recovery of species impacted by the introduction.
- b. Containment measures, such as fishing down at the boundaries of the stock to prevent further spread.

## MSC Fisheries Standard v3.1

- c. Protection and/or creation of faunal refugia.
- d. Provisions in legislation to prohibit further introductions of any other alien species.
- e. Other relevant mechanisms.
- SD3.1.3 If relevant, the team shall add a corresponding ecosystem information scoring issue that addresses the collection of information important to understanding and preventing further impact of the introduced species on biodiversity.
- SD3.1.4 If the fishery has no measures in place for PI 2.4.2 and corresponding information in PI 2.4.3, the team shall justify why measures are not considered necessary in that fishery to prevent further impact on biodiversity, if applicable.

End of Section SD

## Section SE: Principle 1 for stocks managed by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations - normative

This section contains modifications to the FCP and the default assessment tree structure for the assessment of stocks managed by RFMOs. Section SE relates to the scoring and associated conditions of scoring issues (a) and (b) in PI 1.2.1 and PI 1.2.2.

## SE1 General requirements for Section SE

## SE1.1 Modifications to the FCP and default assessment tree

SE1.1.1 The team shall apply Section SE when the target stock(s) being assessed is/are managed by an RFMO. ◙

- SE1.1.2 The team may apply Section SE when the target stock(s) being assessed is/are not

managed by an RFMO.

SE1.1.2.1.

Where there are overlapping UoAs, the CAB shall ensure a harmonised approach to the application of Section SE.

SE1.1.2.2.

The team shall apply Section SE to UoAs that include target stocks not managed by RFMOs only if the majority (more than half) of overlapping UoCs (i.e. UoCs that include the same P1 target stock) agree to do so. ◙

- a. Where no overlapping UoCs exist, SE1.1.2.2 shall apply to UoAs.
- SE1.1.2.3.

If the team applies Section SE when the target stock(s) being assessed is/are not managed by an RFMO, the team shall interpret 'the RFMO' in Section SE requirements as the relevant management agency.

SE1.1.3 The team shall apply Section SE only if there is evidence that the RFMO is committed to the development of a harvest strategy that includes a management procedure (MP) tested within a management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework. ◙

SE1.1.3.1. Evidence could include:

- a. The adoption of a workplan with an associated timeline by the RFMO for development and implementation of harvest strategies.
- b. Letters of correspondence identifying the commitment of that RFMO or the management strategy evaluation testing framework being outlined in management measures and/or resolutions.

The team shall confirm the commitment of the RFMO.

SE1.1.3.2.

- a. The team shall include evidence for this in the Announcement Comment Draft Report.

## SE1.1.4 Unless specifically noted, the team shall follow:

- a. All other FCP requirements.
- b. Section SA default assessment tree PISGs and requirements.

SE1.1.5 This section only includes additions or modifications to the requirements of the FCP and the Section SA default assessment tree.

## SE2 Principle 1 requirements

## SE2.1 Harvest Strategy PI 1.2.1

- SE2.1.1 To determine whether the harvest strategy is 'evaluated', the team shall use only evidence from the adopted harvest strategy, either: ◙
- a. Through direct application of the harvest strategy, or

- b. From modelled predictions of the harvest strategy, if an effectiveness review has not occurred before the condition milestones (SE3.2.4 or SE3.3.5) are completed.

SE2.1.2

- SE2.2.1 The team should require additional precaution to be built into the HCR at SG100 so that the HCR keeps stocks well above LRPs.
- SE2.2.2 The team shall interpret: ◙
- a. 'Generally understood' at SG60 to mean HCRs that can be shown to have been applied in some way in the past but have not been explicitly defined or agreed.
- b. 'Well defined' at SG80 to mean HCRs that exist in some written form that has been agreed by the management agency, ideally with stakeholders, and that state what actions will be taken at what specific TRP levels.
- c. 'In place' at SG60 and SG80 to mean the HCR has been adopted by the management agency and/or there is evidence or documentation that management actions have been taken where required.
- SE2.2.3 In scoring issue (a) at the SG100 level, where quantitative simulation testing is available 'most of the time', the team shall interpret the stock as being maintained at or above BMSY or some ecologically more relevant target point at least 70% of the time.

## Scoring 'available' HCRs at SG60 ◙

SE2.2.4 In scoring issue (a) at the SG60 level, the team shall accept 'available' HCRs instead of HCRs that are 'in place' if:

- a. Stock biomass has not previously been reduced below the MSY level, or stock biomass has been maintained at MSY level for a recent period of time that is at least longer than 2 generation times of the species, and is not predicted to be reduced below BMSY within the next 5 years, or
- b. In UoAs where BMSY estimates are not available, the stock has been maintained to date by the measures in use at levels that have not declined significantly over time, nor shown any evidence of recruitment impairment.
- SE2.2.5 The team shall recognise 'available' HCRs as 'expected to reduce the exploitation rate as the PRI is approached' only if:
- a. 'Generally understood' or 'well-defined' HCRs are in place for some other UoAs that are under the control of the same management body, and of a similar size and scale as the UoA, or
- b. An agreement or framework is in place that requires the management body to adopt HCRs before the stock declines below BMSY.
- SE2.2.6 In scoring issue (c) at the SG60 level, where HCRs are recognised as 'available', the team shall include in its rationale:
- a. Evidence that HCRs are being 'effectively' used in other named UoAs that are managed by the same management body, and the basis on which they are regarded as 'effective', or

- b. A description of the formal agreement or legal framework that the management body has defined, and the indicators and trigger levels that will require the development of HCRs.

## Evaluating the effectiveness of HCRs

SE2.2.7 In scoring issue (c) for 'evidence', the team shall use the current levels of exploitation in the UoA, such as measured by the fishing mortality rate or harvest rate, where available.

SE2.2.7.1.

If information is not available on the exploitation rate consistent with achieving a long-term MSY, the team shall provide justification where available proxy indicators and reference points are used as reasonable proxies of the exploitation rate.

GS1.1

Scope requirements of the MSC Fisheries Standard

GS1.1.3

Enhanced fisheries ▲

## Categories of enhanced fisheries

Table 1 in the MSC Fisheries Standard defines the criteria by which enhanced fisheries may be identified as being within the scope of the MSC Fisheries Standard. The categories of enhanced fisheries that may be in scope are as follows:

## · Hatch and catch (HAC) .

- o This production system may be considered within scope in certain circumstances, reflecting the established case history and precedent set by hatchery-stocked salmon fisheries.
- o For these types of fishery, more-intensive culture activities may be allowed as long as they only apply to a brief period within the species' life cycle.
- o HAC operations that must not form the basis of a recovery and rebuilding plan. If rebuilding has been done by stocking in the past, it shall not result in an out-of-scope determination as long as other measures are now in place to manage wild stocks.

## · Catch and grow (CAG) .

- o This production system's 'grow-out' and holding systems may be considered within scope under certain conditions.
- o CAG has some features of intensive aquaculture, requiring routine inputs, such as feed, chemical, or medicinal treatments, that are out of scope.
- o CAG systems that only require limited enhancement, such as rope culture of bivalves, may be considered within scope for the entirety of their operation.

## · Habitat-modified .

- o This production system involves modification to habitat, such as salmon fry farms located next to river systems.

A single fishery may display several of the features of CAG, HAC, or habitat-modified fisheries. In the application of MSC requirements, it is intended that any overlap between categories should not become complicating factors in determining whether a Unit of Assessment (UoA) is in or out of scope. In some cases, distinctions are drawn between applications of the criteria to these different categories.

For enhanced fisheries, only the part of the catch that is clearly landed during the catching operation, such as that permanently removed from the water by the fishery, would be eligible to enter into MSC certified chains of custody. The part of the catch that is clearly landed would be subject to the normal chain of custody and fishery traceability requirements. Operations in which no part of the catch is clearly landed are considered inseparable from any subsequent 'grow-out' phase, and the scope criteria for enhanced fisheries apply to the operation in its entirety.

## Scope criteria B: feeding and husbandry

The application of criterion Bii in Table 1 specifically to CAG operations recognises that some HAC fisheries may routinely use disease prevention and other measures to maximise survival. These practices are allowed because the short duration of the captive-growth phase will limit the potential environmental impacts. However, these impacts are included in the Principle 2 assessment.

## Scope criteria C: habitat and ecosystem impacts

Habitat modifications in enhanced fisheries can include:

- · Physical changes to the seabed or river course. The wide range of possible modifications include:
- o Construction of simple ponds in intertidal areas.
- o Watercourse management measures aimed at improving spawning habitats.
- · The use of a range of man-made structures associated with the rearing or capture of fish that are not strictly fishing gear. For example:
- · Fish attracting and/or fish aggregating devices (FADs).
- · Lobster casitas.
- · Mussel culture ropes in CAG systems.

Such artificial habitat modifications either enhance the productivity of the fishery, or facilitate the capture or production of commercial marine species.

## GS1.1.5 &amp; GS1.1.6 Exclusion of vessels ▲

The MSC's intent is to prevent access to a certificate where there is evidence of serious crimes or shark-finning offences whilst undertaking fishing operations. This is achieved by preventing vessels implicated in these activities from being included on a fishery certificate.

The team should interpret implication of a vessel to mean that a person, or people, committed a serious crime or a shark-finning offence on board the vessel at some point in the 'last 2 years'.

In cases where fishing operations are not vessel-based, the requirement should be interpreted to mean the exclusion of the individual fishing operator who committed a serious crime or a shark-finning offence while undertaking fishing operations.

## Two-year timeframe

The team should calculate the 'last 2 years' from the date the CAB announces the fishery assessment on the MSC website.

## Location of the activity

If a vessel has been implicated in the conviction of a serious crime or a shark-finning violation in the 'last 2 years' in any jurisdiction or area, not only those included in the UoA, the vessel should not be included on a certificate.

<!-- image -->

## GS1.1.5 Conviction for a serious crime ▲

The definition for serious crime provided is based on that used in the United Nations (UN) Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

<!-- image -->

## GS1.1.5.1 &amp; GS1.1.6.1 Excluding vessels for 2 years ▲

The 2-year exclusion timeframe is calculated from the date the vessel was excluded. The date of exclusion is the date the updated certification documents were published on the MSC website.

If the vessel was excluded at the point of the initial certification, the date of its exclusion is the date the CAB announces the fishery assessment on the MSC website.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

## GS1.1.5.1.b &amp; GS1.1.6.1.b Relevant information ▲

An updated vessel list is an example of relevant information.

## GSA The default assessment tree

<!-- image -->

## Background to GSA guidance ▲

Unless the team can show just cause for why a different tree should apply, the team should use the hierarchical structure and the prescribed default set of Performance Indicator Scoring Guideposts (PISGs) in all assessments.

## Structure of the default assessment tree

The default assessment tree structure is divided into 4 main levels for the purposes of scoring, as summarised below:

- · Principle: the Principles represent the overarching basis for the assessment tree.
- · Component: a high-level sub-division of the Principle.
- · Performance Indicator (PI): A PI is a further sub-division of the Principle.
- · Scoring Issue (SI): a sub-division of the PI into related but different topics. Each PI has one or more SIs against which the fishery is assessed at the SG60, SG80, and SG100 levels.

Figure GSA1: Default assessment tree levels relevant to scoring fisheries

<!-- image -->

For each SI, SGs are defined at 60, 80, and 100 levels. In scoring a fishery, the CAB identifies:

- · The level achieved by the fishery for each SI.
- · The overall level achieved as a result for the PI.

In order to pass, a fishery is required to achieve:

- · At least a 60 score for each PI.

- · At least an aggregate 80 score for each Principle. For a score of less than 80, a condition is assigned.

For specific details on scoring, see FCP 7.15 and related guidance.

Some scoring issues are contained within parenthesis in the PISG tables. This indicates that there may be situations where the team should not score the scoring issue. The team should follow all relevant SA clauses for those scoring issues.

## Default assessment trees

Section SA is designed to be applicable to most fisheries. Section SB and Section SC are default assessment trees for bivalves and salmon respectively. The CAB may develop modified assessment trees for fishery types that cannot be adequately assessed against existing default assessment trees (see FCP 7.10.5).

## GSA1 General

## GSA1.1 General requirements ▲

Box GSA1: Precautionary approach

International and customary law requires the use of the precautionary approach in fisheries management. The MSC uses as its baseline definition for the precautionary approach the definitions included in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries 4  and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement 5 , Article 6 of which states:

The precautionary approach shall be interpreted to mean being cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate and that the absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.

In the 'MSC Fisheries Standard', the application of the precautionary approach in fisheries management systems is explicitly scored in PIs 3.1.3 and 3.2.2. However, the MSC's intent is that the precautionary approach be applied implicitly throughout the Standard. To capture this intent, the MSC system has been designed to give higher scores where there is more certainty about the outcome, or where management systems appropriately apply precaution under conditions of uncertainty. The team should, where limited information is available, be more precautionary in its assessment of information adequacy to support an outcome PI score.

Box GSA2: The MSC's intent and understanding of the standard in relation to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing

The FAO definition of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is as follows 6 :

## Illegal fishing refers to fishing activities:

- · Conducted by national or foreign vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of a state, without the permission of that state, or in contravention of its laws and regulations.
- · Conducted by vessels flying the flag of states that are parties to a relevant regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) but operate in contravention of the conservation and management measures (CMMs) adopted by that organisation and by which the states are bound, or relevant provisions of the applicable international law.
- · In violation of national laws or international obligations, including those conducted by cooperating States to a relevant RFMO.

## Unreported fishing refers to fishing activities:

- · That have not been reported, or have been misreported, to the relevant national authority, in contravention of national laws and regulations.
- · Conducted in the area of competence of a relevant RFMO that have not been reported or have been misreported, in contravention of the reporting procedures of that organisation.

## Unregulated fishing refers to fishing activities:

- · In the area of application of a relevant RFMO that are conducted by vessels without nationality, or by those flying the flag of a state not party to that organisation, or by a fishing entity, in a manner that is not consistent with or contravenes the CMMs of that organisation.
- · In areas or for fish stocks in relation to which there are no applicable conservation or management measures and where such fishing activities are conducted in a manner inconsistent with state responsibilities for the conservation of living marine resources under international law.

These definitions of IUU fishing have been adopted and incorporated into action plans to deter and eliminate IUU fishing at both the national level in the case of the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, and RFMOs, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), as well as economic entities, such as the European Union. RFMOs publish lists of vessels engaged in IUU fishing in their areas of responsibility.

IUU fishing can also apply at a state level; for example, where coastal nations or their subjurisdictions, such as internal states or provinces, have inadequate regulation to prevent illegal, unreported, or unregulated catches.

In relation to IUU, the MSC's intent is that Units of Assessment (UoAs) be harvested legally and that IUU is non-existent; or where IUU does exist, it is at a minimum level such that management measures, including assessments, harvest control rules (HCRs), and the estimation of IUU impacts on harvested species and the ecosystem are capable of maintaining affected populations at sustainable levels.

## Specifically:

- · The team should consider unreported IUU fishing as 'unobserved mortality'.
- · The UoA should be free from IUU catches of target (P1) species. The team should assess this in P1, and in P3: compliance with national and international laws and monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS), such as in PIs 3.1.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3.
- · The stocks that are the source of P1 certified fish should have only minimal IUU fishing, which should be taken into account by management and should not have a material impact on the ability of the management system to deliver a sustainable fishery. The team should consider this in the PIs on HCRs, information, and assessment of stock status in P1, such as in PIs 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4, including documentation of 'unobserved mortality'.
- · The requirement for compliance with national and international laws combined with the requirement that the UoA should not be causing serious and irreversible harm in P2 means that the UoA should also be free from IUU fishing for P2 species. The team should document the impact of other IUU fishing on P2 components where known. However, unlike in P1, the team

need not introduce it into the assessment of the specific impact of the UoA, or cumulative UoAs.

- · The MSC Chain of Custody Standard requires that neither chain of custody certificate holders nor certified UoAs should use vessels that are listed on IUU blacklists to catch or transport fish.
- · The MSC Chain of Custody Standard is designed to ensure that MSC labelled products cannot be mixed with products from a non-certified UoA, where there may be a risk of IUU fishing.

Specific guidance is provided in relation to local, national, and international laws as follows:

- · PI 1.2.3: GSA2.6.3 on information categories to consider for fishery removals.
- · P2 general guidance: GSA3.3.4 on considering observed and unobserved fishing mortality, including illegal fishing, and/or unregulated catches.
- · PI 3.2.3: GSA4.1 on considering compliance and enforcement.

When evaluating the effectiveness of MCS in UoAs where a less formalised MCS system exists, the team may consider the role and effectiveness of a range of factors in deterring illegal activity, as described in GSA4.9 on assessing informal and traditional approaches in PI 3.2.3. GSA4.9 also includes additional guidance on P3 (PI 3.2.3).

## GSA2 Principle 1

## GSA2.1 General requirements for Principle 1 ▲

## Outcome component

## Background

The team should score stock status PI (1.1.1) to reflect management behaviour that:

- · Increases the probability that exploited biomass fluctuates around the biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) target, or a higher target if this is warranted from a consideration of the trophic inter-dependencies of the target species (see Box GSA3 below).
- · Decreases the probability that exploited biomass will drop significantly towards the point where recruitment becomes impaired through recruitment 'overfishing', genetic effects, or imbalances in sex ratio.

Stocks with a status below the point of recruitment impairment (PRI) would not achieve the necessary pass level in PI 1.1.1, even if there were recovery plans or programmes in place that are effectively increasing the status of the stock, until such time as the stock status again meets SG60.

The following outcomes would attract scores of 80 or higher:

- · A higher likelihood of fluctuation around the target biomass level.
- · Biomass levels in excess of target levels, which imply a lower probability of being below target levels.
- · A higher probability of being above the point at which recruitment could be impaired, often used as a biomass limit reference point (LRP).
- · In PI 1.1.2, a more rapid demonstrated rebuilding of stocks from the point where they attract only a 60 score to levels able to deliver MSY.

An explanation of the MSC's intent and understanding in relation to MSY is provided in Box GSA3.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

Box GSA3: The MSC's intent on the achievement of MSY in P1

The MSC's intent is that fisheries be harvested no more than is consistent with MSY, as required by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and that this is achieved through use of appropriate target reference points (TRPs) and limit reference points (LRPs), and of harvest strategies, as required by the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF), where:

- · A TRP reflects a management objective to be achieved; for example, performance consistent with MSY.
- · An LRP reflects an undesirable state to be avoided with high probability; for example, impaired recruitment.

The most basic definition of MSY is the largest long-term average annual catch that can be sustained over time. The FAO Glossary defines MSY as:

The largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions. For species with fluctuating recruitment, the maximum might be obtained by taking fewer fish in some years than in others.

The constant fishing mortality that gives this MSY is FMSY, where F is the fishing mortality rate. The average population size while MSY is provided is BMSY.

MSY was originally defined in terms of simple production models. However, the concept is now equally applicable to any model of the stock and fishery; for example, more complex production models, dynamic pool models, 'per-recruit' models, multi-stock/mixed stock models, ecosystem models, and meta-population models.

There are many ways to estimate MSY and related reference points. Many of them, particularly the older methods common at the time UNCLOS and UNFSA were agreed, make substantial assumptions. Therefore, there can be considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of the estimates of MSY and related reference points.

Because the productivity, or recruitment, of many fish stocks is naturally highly variable through time, the biomass can vary greatly around BMSY, in some cases even with an appreciable chance of the stock being below the biomass LRP, when fished at the constant FMSY. This variability in stock biomass can be mitigated by using an HCR that reduces the fishing mortality when stock biomass is low or an LRP is approached, as recommended by UNFSA and CCRF. For some HCRs, including the constant escapement policies common in salmon and some low small pelagic fisheries, the fishing mortality is reduced to zero at a threshold stock biomass 7 .

Reflecting the uncertainty usual in the estimation of MSY reference points and the variability of productivity usual in fish stocks, the UNFSA guidelines and others 8  recommend that FMSY should be treated as a precautionary LRP, rather than a TRP. This is appropriate in 'common practice' application of MSY concepts, in which there is little explicit consideration of uncertainty and/or use of approximate methods for determining MSY reference points and/or use of surrogates for fishing mortality or stock biomass.

The 'best practice' current view of MSY is that it is the largest long-term average catch that results from a constant F or variable F HCR, while simultaneously giving a high chance of avoiding the biomass LRP. MSY is determined by simulation testing, such as via management strategy

evaluation methods 9 , that includes realistic representation of the major likely uncertainties; for example, observation uncertainty, estimation uncertainty, recruitment variability, model structure uncertainty, and implementation uncertainty. FMSY determined this way could be an appropriate TRP, because its method of calculation internalises uncertainty, variability, and the biomass LRP.

## MSY stock status

The stock status consistent with MSY is fundamentally defined in the terms FMSY and BMSY. Hence, the 'MSC Fisheries Standard' provides default TRPs and LRPs for these. The team can use approximations for FMSY and BMSY where they are expected to achieve performance consistent with MSY 10 .

The team can use directly measurable, empirical proxies or surrogates for fishing mortality or biomass, for example average length or length distribution, catch rate, recruitment, and escapement, and associated empirical harvest strategies, where they are expected to achieve performance consistent with MSY or a similar 'highly productive' level 11  (i.e. multispecies fisheries).

## Subsidies in fishing

The MSC does not name individual subsidy types as harmful or not harmful to fishing. However, some subsidies may contribute to overcapacity, which may compromise the ability of a management system to effectively control fishing effort. When considering the effectiveness of a management strategy and its ability to meet P1 outcomes, the team should take into account any impacts of fishing overcapacity and other issues resulting from subsidies.

If overcapacity exists as a result of subsidies, the team should consider whether the management system is robust enough to deal with this issue and still deliver a sustainable fishery as per Principle 1 and Principle 2.

## GSA 2.1.1 ▲

It is the MSC's intent that any stock determined to be an endangered, threatened or protected (ETP) species cannot be assessed under Principle 1.

## GSA2.2 Stock status Performance Indicator (PI 1.1.1) ▲

## GSA2.2.1.1 Determination of status with respect to PRI and BMSY ▲

The team should score PI 1.1.1 against the conceptual levels PRI and MSY. Such levels may or may not be used as explicit reference points in a fishery.

When well-managed stocks do not have TRPs or LRPs, or their values are not consistent with the conceptual levels of PRI or MSY, the team will still need to assess the stock in terms of the overall outcome objectives. For example, for SG80 the stock status is 'highly likely' to be above the point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired and will be at or around a level consistent with BMSY.

The team should interpret the PRI as the point below which there is an increased risk that recruitment may be substantially impaired. Fisheries should be managed such that the risk of stocks falling below this level is very low. The MSC default proxies for the PRI and MSY are given in GSA2.2.3.

## GSA2.2.2 Scoring fluctuations around the target MSY level - scoring issue (b)

<!-- image -->

▲

Fluctuation in this context refers to the variability over time around a point, acknowledging that the magnitude of fluctuation will be influenced by the biology of the species, and that short-term trends may be apparent in such fluctuations.

Examples of situations that may be regarded as 'fluctuating around a level consistent with MSY' and thus able to achieve at least an 80 score for PI 1.1.1 scoring issue (b) are given below.

The team should note that the 90%BMSY figure in the example below is given as a hypothetical level that may be appropriate for species types with average levels of fluctuations. Other values may be appropriate for other species types.

## Examples: 80 score

Examples of situations that may be regarded as 'fluctuating around a level consistent with MSY' and thus able to achieve an 80 score for PI 1.1.1 scoring issues (b):

- · An instantaneous estimate of current stock status that is not less than 90%BMSY.
- · A recent series of estimates of stock size that has:
- o A median or mean value over the last one generation time that is not less than 90%BMSY. (For a definition of generation time, see GSA2.2.4, Box GSA4)
- o A trend that is consistent with an expectation that the future biomass will continue to fluctuate around BMSY. A consistent downward trend over recent years to levels below BMSY would not be consistent with this expectation, unless accompanied by projections or other information suggesting that the trend will soon be reversed; for example, due to incoming strong recruitment or recent reductions in exploitation level. The time series may include estimates that are less than 90%BMSY, as long as these are shown to be part of a long-term fluctuation around BMSY.

- · A series of estimates showing a steady increase in stock size that has recently returned to a level not less than 90%BMSY, and is expected to continue building to above BMSY, and thereafter to fluctuate around BMSY.

## Examples: 100 score

Examples of situations that may achieve the higher 100 score on PI 1.1.1 scoring issue (b):

- · A recent series of estimates of stock size that has a mean or median over the last 2 generation times that is not less than 90%BMSY.
- · A series of estimates of stock size that have been above BMSY in all years of the last one generation time.

The team should note that, in reviewing fluctuations in stock size, a model-derived estimate of stock size from the most recent year will often be more uncertain than a model-derived estimate from earlier years. To avoid rapid changes in status of MSC certified stocks and consequent changes in certification status, as specified in FCP 7.30, the team should consider that model-derived estimates may not be indicative of actual material change in stock status. The team should note that a single estimate of stock status unsupported by an estimate of certainty, either derived from a time-series trend or from a statistical model, should only be used to justify a material change in the score.

The MSC has chosen not to define its requirements in relation to the terms 'overfishing' and 'overfished'. Nevertheless, these terms are commonly used, and are referred to in some guidance as follows:

- · 'Overfishing' is fishing mortality higher than FMSY.
- o The fishing mortality level that results, in the long term, in the stock being at MSY.
- · 'Overfished': biomass stock size is lower than a limit defined in relation to MSY.
- o The FAO Ecolabelling Guidelines define 'overfished' as below a biomass LRP. The limit is often taken to be 50%BMSY, which is the default assumption for the point below the PRI as defined by the MSC.
- o The term is not commonly used internationally to relate to the PRI, and hence its use in MSC program documents is limited.

## GSA2.2.3 Use of proxy indicators and reference points for PRI and BMSY ▲

In this section the term 'reference point' is used in relation to determination of status.

Writing the PISGs in terms of biomass and fishing rate metrics would suggest that the 'MSC Fisheries Standard' is not well suited for fisheries that do not commonly have stock assessments conducted in which biological reference points for biomass and/or fishing mortality are estimated. This is not the intent.

Default values for the levels of the PRI and BMSY, as used in scoring the stock status PI 1.1.1, are given below. They are often related to B0, the estimated 'unfished biomass' that would be present in the absence of fishing. Stock status is typically expressed as population biomass relative to BMSY, a proxy for BMSY, or a specified management target, but in some cases may instead be expressed relative to B0.

- · In the case where neither BMSY nor the PRI are analytically determined, the following default reference points may be appropriate for measuring stock status depending on the species:

BMSY = 40%B0.

PRI = 20%B0 = ½BMSY.

- · If either BMSY or the PRI are analytically determined, the team should preferentially use those values as the reference points for measuring stock status unless additional precaution is sought.

- · In the case where BMSY is analytically determined to be greater than 40%B0, and there is no analytical determination of the PRI, the default PRI should be ½BMSY. This case covers situations of low productivity stocks, where higher default PRIs may be justified.
- · In the case where BMSY is analytically determined to be lower than 40%B0, as in some 'highly productive' stocks, and there is no analytical determination of the PRI, the default PRI should be 20%B0 unless BMSY &lt; 27%B0, in which case the default PRI should be 75%BMSY.
- · For stocks with average productivity, where BMSY is not analytically determined but assumed to be 40%B0 and a management TRP is set greater than 40%B0 for precautionary reasons, the default PRI should still be set at 20%B0 = ½BMSY unless it is analytically determined. This covers situations where the management authority has deliberately chosen a conservative TRP, but where the default PRI is still appropriate.
- · In cases where the PRI is set at 20%B0, the team may assume the default value for the BMSY to be 2 x PRI.
- · In cases where the PRI is set at the lowest historical biomass, the team cannot assume that BMSY = 2PRI. The team is expected to justify any 'reference point' used as a proxy of BMSY in terms of its consistency with BMSY.
- · Where historical estimates of stock size and resulting recruitment are available, the PRI may be identifiable as the stock size below which reduced recruitment has been observed, and above which recruitment appears to be more related to environmental factors than to stock size.
- · Where a biomass escapement strategy is used, the team should ensure it allows for optimised catches while ensuring that enough spawning biomass remains to avoid recruitment impairment. Typically, an annual escapement of around 40% is considered a pragmatic proxy for MSY.

The default PRI values given above, ½BMSY or 20%B0, apply to stocks with average productivity. Such points are generally consistent with being above the point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired. For some 'highly productive' stocks, the actual point at which there is an appreciable risk that recruitment is impaired may be lower than 20%B0. For some long-lived species, it may be higher than 20%B0.

If management has defined a target range for BMSY rather than a single value, the team should score the stock status PI 1.1.1 against this range. The application of TRP ranges rather than a single value may be seen in fisheries targeting 'highly productive' stocks as a way of dealing with the inherent variability in biomass. A range provides some intrinsic flexibility for determining whether the stock is fluctuating at or around BMSY. The team should:

- · Provide sufficient rationale to demonstrate how the stock is indeed fluctuating at or around BMSY.
- · Consider whether different 'reference points' are required for different components of the stock in its assessment.

If proxies are used that are not expressed as percentages of B0, the team should generally ensure that:

- · Any 'reference point' used as a proxy for scoring the PRI is set above the point where there is an appreciable risk of recruitment failure.
- · Any 'reference point' used as a proxy for the MSY level maintains the stock well above the PRI and at levels of production and stock sizes consistent with BMSY or a similar 'highly productive' level.

If proxy 'reference points' are defined in this way, the team should take account of the difference between the 'reference point' and the required PRI or MSY levels in its scoring.

The team should be cautious regarding 'per-recruit' stock assessment approaches that do not include any form of stock-recruit relationship. Levels of F0.1 or F40%SPR (where SPR is spawning potential ration) will usually, for example, provide more reliable proxies of FMSY than Fmax when a 'per-recruit' approach is used.

The team should not assume 'reference points' such as precautionary 'reference points' for spawning stock biomass (BPA), that are used as a buffer to reduce the chance of declining to a limit level such as the PRI, to be consistent with BMSY. For example, the team should regard the BMSYtrigger

approach (where BMSYtrigger is a biomass 'reference point' that triggers a cautious response when stocks fall below a trigger level) used in ICES as setting a lower limit to the likely range of values that BMSY may take, and not as an estimated value for BMSY.

In ICES assessments, the team may regard fisheries with biomass (B) &gt; BMSYtrigger as 'fluctuating around BMSY', thereby achieving an 80 score.

The team may also use proxy indicators and 'reference points' for measuring stock status where the exact relationship with the PRI, BMSY, and FMSY levels are not known.

## Examples: proxies and necessary consideration

- · If empirical values of catch per unit effort (CPUE), not based on an explicit stock assessment, are used as reference points for monitoring biomass, the team could provide rationales that the values adopted are consistent with MSY or a similar 'highly productive' level. The team may need to check to ensure, in this case, that spatial changes in fishing, or changes in the catchability of gear do not reduce the reliability of the proxy indicators.
- · If reference points for measuring stock status are based on some historical state, the team should:
- o Consider the position of the stock at that time relative to the unexploited level.
- o Consider the likely proximity to BMSY.
- o Provide evidence that the stock was not over-exploited at the historical reference time.
- o Provide evidence that the catch was sustainable and 'highly productive'.
- · If mean fish sizes are used as reference points for the exploitation level, the team should provide rationales that the values adopted are consistent with FMSY or similar levels.
- · In crustacean fisheries that seek to protect from harvest the complete female reproductive capacity in the population (single sex harvest), reference points could relate to metrics such as percent fertilised eggs and/or other female population indicators that are used in evaluating the management system's effectiveness at achieving its goal.
- · Biomass escapement strategies are used for a variety of fisheries including those that target stocks that are short-lived, semelparous, exhibit high natural mortality, and/or a weak stockrecruit relationship (e.g. salmon or squid). A target amount or percentage of individuals needed to survive ('escape') is determined that ensures there is sufficient spawning biomass. Escapement can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. Provided the stock can be shown to be fluctuating around a 'highly productive' level and is above any point where recruitment could be impaired, these proxies may be seen as being at a level consistent with MSY. The level of escapement can be kept constant, based on average conditions, or be variable to account for differences in year classes (e.g. real-time management).
- · For fisheries targeting semelparous species (e.g. cephalopods), some stocks have almost full replacement of the population during each generational cycle. Investigating the spawnerrecruitment relationship may help estimate stock size from prior data, and from that, a level of harvest that can maintain productivity consistent with MSY.

## Examples: using proxy reference points

Examples of how the team may justify SG60, SG80, and SG100 levels in these situations:

- · SG60 if no decline has been observed in 1 proxy of biomass for at least one generation time of the species and the proxy indicates that the stock is ' likely' above the PRI .
- · SG80 if no decline has been observed in 2 proxies of biomass for one generation time and at least one proxy indicates that the stock is at a ' highly productive' level .
- · SG100 if no decline has been observed in 3 proxies of biomass for one generation time and at least 2 proxies indicate that the stock is at a 'highly productive' level.

In these cases, where higher scores are justified by the use of more than one proxy indicator, such proxies should be independent of each other and also reasonably be expected to be proxies of the quantity of interest, such as CPUE in the case of stock biomass.

In some cases, the team may argue that 1 good proxy is better than 2 or more weak proxies.

## GSA2.2.3.2 ▲

For example, as with a 'traffic lights' approach to management.

## GSA2.2.4 Scoring stock status using fishing mortality rate ▲

The team should examine the history of F to determine whether the stock biomass could be assumed to be at the required level for each SG. This will depend on the starting status for stock biomass, the trajectory of fishing mortality, and the length of time that fishing mortality has been at a certain level.

If the starting biomass is unknown, the team should apply the following expectations:

- · At least SG60 score is justified if F is 'likely' to have been at or below FMSY for at least 1 generation time of the species, or for at least 2 years, if greater. This level of F is generally expected to be able to recover, or maintain, a population likely to be above its PRI.
- · At least SG80 is justified where B is 'highly likely' to be above the PRI and at or 'fluctuating around BMSY', if F is likely to have been at or below FMSY for at least 2 generation times, or for at least 4 years, if greater.
- · SG100 score is justified if F is 'highly likely' to have been below FMSY for at least 2 generation times, or for at least 4 years, if greater.

These guidelines are based on the assumption that fishing mortality will in these cases be at or very closely below FMSY. The lower the fishing mortality has been, the shorter the time interval required for recovery. For instance, while most species require about 2 generation times to recover from the PRI to BMSY when fishing is at FMSY, when F is reduced to 80%FMSY or 60%FMSY, the time for recovery may be halved. The team should take these issues into account when scoring.

Box GSA4: Generation time

The MSC defines a generation time (GT) as the average age of a reproductive individual in an unexploited stock 12 :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where a is age, A is the oldest age in an unfished state, Ea is the maturity at age a, and Na is the number per recruit alive at age a in the absence of fishing.

𝑁𝑎 = 𝑁0𝑒 -𝑀𝑎 where M is natural mortality and No =1 (per recruit).

The equation provided above computes GT with the parameter Ea being 'maturity at age a'. The original Goodyear formula computes GT with the parameter Ea being 'mean fecundity of females at age a', which is estimated based on the product of the fraction of mature females and the average fecundity of mature females. The equation provided above is consistent with the original Goodyear formula but is more accessible because the information required is less onerous. The underlying assumption in the equation above is that fecundity is constant for all ages in the population, so that GT can be computed using the fraction of mature females only, referred to as 'maturity'. Information about female fecundity, which requires specific equipment and expertise and thus is more expensive than maturity information, is not necessary to compute GT.

Another reasonable approximation for GT, when 0.1 ≤ M ≤ 2 is:

1/M + Am50

where Am50 is the age at 50% maturity.

The team should use an appropriate formula considering the data available, or peerreviewed/published material for the target stock.

When several methods can be applied and it is not clear which should be chosen, the team should apply weight of evidence and precautionary approaches for the computation of GT.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

Box GSA5: Consideration of fishing mortality rate in MSC assessments

The guidance in this section covers a specific situation: where F is being used as an indicator of the status of the stock when actual biomass estimates are not available.

The use of fishing mortality information is usually an indicator of the level of exploitation in a fishery. This is particularly relevant in the scoring of the rebuilding PI, 1.1.2, and the HCR PI, 1.2.2. The general expectations in these cases are summarised below:

- · PI 1.1.2 (rebuilding) - when B is below a level at which it could be regarded as 'fluctuating around BMSY', then F should normally be less than FMSY, in order to achieve recovery to such a level.
- · PI 1.2.2 (HCRs) - to be regarded as working effectively, HCRs will normally maintain F equal to or less than FMSY.

Only a few exceptions to these general 'rules' are allowed. The team should support exceptions with clear justifications, such as the special nature of a stock assessment approach or the availability of other specific information.

For further details, see GSA2.3.4 and GSA2.5.3.

The team should note that F should be maintained at lower than MSY levels in key low trophic level (LTL) fisheries.

See comments on multi-stock and mixed stock fisheries and stock complexes in Box GSA3.

## GSA2.2.7 Consideration of environmental variability, including climate change, and human-induced impacts ▲

Ecosystem productivity may change naturally over time, for example under conditions of regime shift. Where changes to stock productivity are the result of natural fluctuations in environmental conditions, the values of reference points may also change, as reflected in stock assessments. These changes are acceptable when scoring the status of the stock in PI 1.1.1.

In situations where the productivity of the stock is affected through human-induced impacts, either directly from the UoA (e.g. excessive fishing) or from other sources such as pollution or habitat degradation (e.g. the clearance of mangrove swamps affecting fish nursery areas), reduction of reference points is not justified. The fishery should receive a lower score in PI 1.1.1 until effective management is in place and the stock returns to healthy levels.

The MSC recognises the multipurpose nature of use patterns, particularly in inland waters. Example uses include:

- · Dam construction for water supply and power.
- · Channelisation for navigation and flood control.
- · Land drainage.
- · Wetland reclamation for agricultural uses.

Such uses are generally fundamental to the functioning of modern society and outside the management control of the fishing sector. Where users from other, non-fishery sectors have impacts on the fishery, management should consider these impacts when devising a strategy for achieving management objectives.

## Example

If water is withdrawn for agriculture and urban supply and this has an adverse impact on fish stocks, the management of the fishery is expected to address this fact, perhaps by reducing fishing or with time/area closures.

Climate change is a human-induced impact on fishery productivity. However, the impact of climate change is not easily resolved. Such changes are thus regarded as more similar to those arising from regularly occurring cycles or regime shifts, as covered under SA2.2.7.1. The team should note the further guidance on scoring of climate change in:

- · PI 1.1.2 (stock rebuilding, see GSA2.3).
- · PI 1.2.2 (harvest control rules, and the scoring of uncertainty).
- · PI 2.4.3 (ecosystem information, see SA3.17.1.

If there is evidence that productivity changes are related to the impacts of long-term climate change, the team should note that appropriate adjustments need to be made to reference points. In such instances, the team should use indicators to determine stock status.

## GSA2.2.8 Treatment of key LTL stocks ▲

LTL species, also referred to as forage fish, play a crucial role in marine food webs in many ecosystems. For this reason, the MSC has defined specific management and outcome requirements for key LTL stocks. The intent of the MSC's requirements on the treatment of LTL stocks is focused on limiting the ecosystem impacts caused by the commercial harvest of these important species.

Box GSA6: Special management requirements for key LTL stocks

The ecological importance of LTL species such as sardines, anchovy, and krill and the control they can exert on the rest of the food web is well established 13 .

Because of their significant ecological importance, unsustainable exploitation of forage fish populations can impact the marine food web by causing declines in top marine predator, seabird and marine mammal populations, or even threaten food security in some countries by diverting forage fish from human consumption.

A principal distinction within the MSC requirements is the recognition of key LTL stocks as separate from non-key LTL stocks. The intent is that the team should assess all forage fish stocks against their potential ecosystem importance when applying for certification against the MSC Standard, but the specific higher management requirements only apply to those stocks recognised as 'key LTL'.

A species that feeds predominately on plankton and is found in the diets of many predators will likely be a key LTL stock. The MSC guidance on this topic (GSA2.2.9) provides examples of how these criteria can be met. Following a precautionary approach, if it is not possible to provide a justified argument that at least 2 of the criteria are NOT met, the team should treat the stock as key LTL.

The first 2 criteria 14  and the thresholds used relate directly to the levels of ecosystem impact that the depletion of the LTL species would have. If the team determines a species to be key LTL, the removal of this species beyond defined precautionary reference points would likely cause a cascade effect in the wider ecosystem.

The MSC defines the default precautionary reference points for management of key LTL species as:

- · A biomass that is 75% of the unexploited level in the system, or
- · A target exploitation rate of 0.5FMSY or 0.5M, the natural mortality of the species.

In fisheries where there is sufficient understanding of the system, the team can use credible ecosystem models (as defined in SA2.2.14) to adjust these default reference points to specific levels appropriate to the fishery, where these levels are shown not to have adverse ecosystem effects.

The MSC's intent is that the team should evaluate key LTL target stocks scored under PI 1.2.1 scoring issue (a), PI 1.2.2 scoring issue (a), and PI 1.2.4 scoring issue (b) against management objectives in PI 1.1.1A at the SG 80 level and not PI 1.1.1.

If an LTL stock is not key, it is assumed that the impacts of removing it are not of particular importance to the wider ecosystem. The team should assess the stock in PI 1.1.1, using the default requirements.

## GSA2.2.9 Identification of key LTL stocks ▲

The team should use the following to demonstrate whether a stock under assessment should be treated as a key LTL stock:

- · The use of qualitative information on the ecosystem.
- · Diet matrices to construct food webs.
- · Ecosystem models that demonstrate the connection between species and trophic groups in the ecosystem.

If the team uses ecosystem models, they must be 'credible'. The team should interpret 'credible' as:

- · Publicly available and well documented, such as peer-reviewed scientific papers.
- · Fitted to time-series data.
- · Comprehensive, dealing with the whole ecosystem, including all trophic levels 15 .

Where species are aggregated into trophic groups in ecosystem models, the degree of aggregation should adhere to guidance 16  that:

- · Aggregations do not include serially linked groups: predators and prey.
- · Aggregations are not across species, age classes, or functional groups with rate constants that differ by more than 2-3-fold. If possible, the team should base information about trophic connection on empirical evidence of trophic dependence.

The team may also use diet matrices, which characterise the proportion of prey eaten by each predator, in addition to the simple linkages between predators. If diet matrices are used, the team must construct them in adherence with the guidance 17 .

## Example

If key LTL stocks are identified by using total catch as a proxy for total biomass of the stock, the team should scale this up to the spatial extent of the stock and its predators. For example, the CAB should interpret a low-volume fishery in a major coastal upwelling system differently to one in a small embayment with several locally dependent predators.

In determining key LTL status, the team should consider the spatial scale of the ecosystem that could be affected, and from which information should be derived. This should generally correspond to the spatial distribution of the stock being fished and could be broader in some instances; for example, if the stock occurs within a well-defined spatial entity such as a gulf or regional sea. It will not necessarily correspond to the jurisdictional scale of the fishery. If the spatial scale of the ecosystem is considerably larger than the stock distribution, the team should consider potential impacts of localised depletion on predators.

Considering temporal scale, seasonality is not relevant to determining key LTL status. If the stock meets two or more of the sub-criteria in SA2.2.9 during only part of the year (e.g. during spawning of feeding aggregations but not during the rest of the year when the stock is dispersed or mixed with other stocks) the team should consider the criteria met and designate the stock as key LTL. If the target stock or stock component under assessment is widely distributed and is present in more than one ecosystem, the team should focus on the ecosystem containing the largest abundance of the species when assessing sub-criteria i, ii and iii in SA2.2.9.a.

## GSA2.2.9.a.i Key LTL criterion i - connectivity ▲

This sub-criterion requires that the LTL stock is eaten by the majority of predators.

In quantitative terms, food webs can be used to investigate connectance, which can be expressed as unweighted 'proportional connectance' or the weighted SURF index, where SURF is SUpportive Role to Fishery ecosystems. SURF has the advantage that it is less sensitive to the grouping of predator and prey species than connectance 18 .

Proportional connectance (PC) is calculated from a diet matrix that has n components, and only requires a knowledge of the interaction between groups, not the proportional diet fraction of each group, as follows:

- · The total connectance (T) in a diet matrix is the number of all positive, non-zero, diet interactions between components (i.e. predator-prey).
- · The connectance (C) of a component is the total number of prey interactions plus the total number of predator interactions of that component calculated from the diet matrix.
- · Then the proportional connectance of prey i is 𝑃𝐶𝑖 = 𝐶𝑖 𝑇 .

SURF is calculated as follows:

- · 𝑆𝑈𝑅𝐹𝑖 = ∑ 𝑛 (𝑝 𝑗,𝑖 ) 2 𝑗=1 𝑇 .
- · Where pij is the diet fraction of predator   on prey  : the proportion of the diet of predator   that is j i j made up of prey  . i

Figure GSA2 shows the results, for key and non-key LTL species classified according to the MSC definition: if, when fishing at B/B0 = 40%, no single ecosystem group is reduced by more than 70% of its B0, and no more than 15% of ecosystem groups are perturbed by more than 40% from their B0 using the data in Smith et al. (2011) 19 , of calculating connectance and SURF.

(2011) 20 , plotted against their impact on the ecosystem: category 1 satisfies SA2.2.14a at B/B0 = 40% and is classified as non-key LTL; category 2 fails SA2.2.14a and is classified as key LTL

The team should assume that based on the analyses illustrated in Figure GSA2:

19 Smith, A.D.M., Brown, C.J., Bulman, C.M., Fulton, E.A., Johnson, P., Kaplan, I.C, Lozano-Montes, H., Mackinson, S., Marzloff, M., Shannon, L.J., Yunne-Jai, S., and Tam, J.

(2011) Impacts of fishing low-trophic level species on marine

- · Connectance values of less than 4% will normally indicate a non-key LTL stock.
- · Connectance values of greater than 8% will indicate a key LTL stock.
- · SURF values of less than 0.001 will normally indicate a non-key LTL stock.
- · SURF values of greater than 0.001 will normally indicate a key LTL stock.

The team may take further qualitative evidence of predator dependency in the intermediate zone into consideration, where the classification of the stock is uncertain. For example:

- · If the stock is important in the diets of many higher predators for much of the year, where 'importance' here might be shown by:
- o The species being the preferred diet of a predator, compared to other prey species that also occur in the diet depending on availability, or
- o The species having higher calorific value or other specific fitness; for example, for the development of juveniles.
- · If land-based colonies of predators, including seals, fur seals, sea lions, penguins, and other birds, are considered particularly dependent on this LTL stock.
- · If large aggregations of other species are known to gather to feed on this LTL stock.

If there is no credible quantitative model, the team will require ecosystem-specific understanding of the food web connections in the whole ecosystem in order to assess the percentage of connections. The team should base this understanding on a comprehensive species list that identifies links for major prey and predators, particularly dependent predators of the LTL stock in question, supported by the considerations presented above.

## GSA2.2.9.a.ii Key LTL criterion ii - energy transfer ▲

- · The team may determine whether this criterion is triggered based on:
- o Empirical data.
- o Credible quantitative models.
- o Information about the relative abundance of the LTL stock in the ecosystem.
- · Consumer biomass ratio is calculated as the biomass of the candidate key LTL stock, divided by the biomass of all consumers in the ecosystem: all ecosystem components that are not primary producers or detritus: consumer biomass ratio = BLTL/Bconsumers.
- · Model-based results suggest that the team should regard any LTL stock that constitutes more than 5% of the consumer biomass in the ecosystem as a key LTL stock.
- · The importance of the size of a key LTL stock in determining whether there is a large volume of energy transfer through it will depend upon the size of the total energy in the ecosystem, and in the consumer biomass, as defined above.
- · The size of the catch of a key LTL stock is not directly indicative of its likely importance in energy transfer. However, in approximate terms, catch size can be assumed to relate to ecosystem importance. The team may use catch size to support a plausible argument that an LTL species meets, or does not meet criterion SA2.2.14, as follows:
- o LTL stocks that are subject to small catches by small-scale fisheries, where small catches are &lt; 50,000t average total catch from the stock over the last 5 years, will not normally be key LTL stocks. Catches beneath this threshold may still indicate key LTL stocks in cases where they are taken from unusually small ecosystems.
- o It is less easy to predict the status of LTL stocks subject to large catches, where large catches are &gt; 100,000t total catches from the stock over the last 5 years. The CAB should not assume that these fisheries are accessing non-key LTL stocks.

## GSA2.2.9.a.iii Key LTL criterion iii - 'wasp-waistedness' ▲

This sub-criterion requires that there are few other species at this trophic level through which energy can be transmitted from lower to higher trophic levels, such that a high proportion of the total energy passing between lower and higher trophic levels passes through this stock.

- · Simple food webs will be sufficient to determine whether there are significant other functionally similar species at a similar trophic level to the candidate LTL stock.
- o Although for the candidate LTL species, the focus is on the adult component of the stock (SA2.2.9.a, SA2.2.9.b), the team should consider all life stages (including juveniles) of other species at the same trophic level.
- · The team may examine catch statistics of other species of the types listed in Box SA1 or SA2.2.9.b within the same ecosystem to determine whether there are few significant catches of other species at this trophic level.
- o In ecosystems where the catches of the candidate LTL stock are less than those of all other species at the same trophic level, the team may regard the ecosystem as not 'wasp-waisted' and the candidate stock will not normally be a key LTL stock.

## Example

Sardine would be considered a key LTL species in the southern Benguela current system but not in the northern Humboldt system in its current state, as of 2010. If the Humboldt system were to shift to a sardine-based rather than an anchovy-based system, sardine would once again become a key LTL species in that ecosystem.

As with other MSC guidance on ecosystem change, for instance relating to climate change and multidecadal environmental cycles, the CAB needs to:

- · Be aware of changes in ecosystem structure and productivity.
- · Assess in surveillance reports, or in assessment/reassessment, the extent to which the fishery has taken these into account. For instance:
- o In the case of productivity, by adjusting TRPs and LRPs.
- o In the case of ecosystem regime shifts such as above, by reconsidering the species against the key LTL species definition.

## GSA2.2.12-GSA2.2.15 Scoring stock status for key LTL stocks ▲

Estimates for B0 referred to in SA2.2.13 and SA2.2.14 can be determined using credible single species or ecosystem models or robust empirical data (such as fishery independent surveys).

See Smith et al. 21  for the justification of impact levels required in SA2.2.14.b and the use of a default 75%B0 target level for their achievement.

21 Smith, A.D.M., Brown, C.J., Bulman, C.M., Fulton, E.A., Johnson, P., Kaplan, I.C, Lozano-Montes, H., Mackinson, S., Marzloff, M., Shannon, L.J., Yunne-Jai, S., and Tam, J. (2011) Impacts of fishing low-trophic level species on marine ecosystems. Science 333, 1147-1150.

## GSA2.2.16 Scoring key LTL stocks based on fishing mortality rate ▲

In the absence of robust estimates for B0, target F values that would achieve the appropriate target biomass levels can be adopted. Studies 22  have found that exploitation rates of about half MSY rates were required to limit the ecosystem impacts to the same levels obtained at the default 75%B0.

For key LTL species, the team should modify default expectations provided in GSA2.2.4 for non-key LTL species to reflect the higher biomass levels expected and the lower F needed.

At least SG60 is justified if F is 'likely' to have been somewhat below FMSY but not as low as 50%FMSY for at least one generation time of the species, or for at least 2 years, if greater.

At least SG80 is justified if F is 'likely' to have been at 0.5FMSY or 0.5M for at least 2 generation times, or for at least 4 years, if greater.

SG100 is justified if F is 'highly likely' to have been below 0.5FMSY or 0.5M for at least 2 generation times, or for at least 4 years, if greater.

## GSA2.2.17 Allowing for recruitment variability ▲

Environmental variability is generally high for fisheries based on key LTL species compared to nonLTL fisheries. In some cases, this makes biomass-based reference points meaningless and better justifies the use of F-based management approaches.

## GSA2.3 Stock rebuilding PI (PI 1.1.2) ▲

## Background

The MSC Fisheries Standard does not refer to 'formal recovery plans'. This is because, in some jurisdictions, this terminology carries specific legislative or regulatory meaning. Fisheries are instead expected to have 'recovery strategies', which may or may not be binding in a statutory context. This PI is only scored when PI 1.1.1/PI 1.1.1.A does not meet the SG80.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - rebuilding timeframes ▲

If quantitative stock assessment information is used in scoring this PI, the team should note that stock rebuilding timeframes required in scoring issue (a) relate to the time required for the stock to recover from the current level to BMSY, or a level regarded as 'consistent with MSY' where proxies are used.

On this basis, it may be impossible for some stocks to meet recovery targets in a 5-year timeframe because of the life-history parameters of the species under assessment. Such parameters include:

- · Growth rate.
- · Size or age at maturity or recruitment to the fishery.
- · Stock size or age composition.
- · Longevity.
- · Natural mortality.

22 Pikitch, E., Boersma, P.D., Boyd, I.L., Conover, D.O., Cury, P., Essington, T., Heppell, S.S., Houde, E.D., Mangel, M., Pauly, D., Plagányi, É., Sainsbury, K., and Steneck, R.S. (2012) Little Fish, Big Impact: Managing a Crucial Link in Ocean Food Webs. Lenfest Ocean Program. Washington, DC. 108 pp.

However, some very-fast-growing stocks may recover in less than 1 certification period (5 years). An extension to 5 years is allowed for these stocks.

As allowed in the scoring of other PIs, the CAB should apply the definition of generation time given in Box GSA4.

<!-- image -->

## GSA2.3.2-GSA2.3.3 Timeframes for achieving conditions ▲

The team should note that stocks that trigger rebuilding may be allowed 1 year to put rebuilding strategies and monitoring in place. This would likely be relevant if the stock status dropped below SG80 for PI 1.1.1/PI 1.1.1A after certification. If one year is needed in this instance, the team should put a condition on PI 1.1.1 to allow PI 1.1.2 to be scored at the next surveillance. After one year, the team can then rescore PI 1.1.2 and assign conditions as appropriate. Given that the SG60 level would not be met for PI 1.1.2 when the one-year condition is put in place, the team should submit a variation request against FCP v3.1 7.15.7.2.a, 7.15.13, 7.15.14, and 7.16.3.

The team may consider allowances of more than 1 year in fisheries where stock assessments and the development of management advice are not an annual event.

If PI 1.1.2 scores less than SG80, due to a lack of evidence for rebuilding, the condition applied to develop such evidence should still be achieved within the normal maximum 5-year duration of the certificate (as required in SA2.3.3). While the MSC's allowance for 'exceptional circumstances' in FCP 7.16.6 may still apply to rebuilding of the stock, which may be constrained by the species biology, it should not apply here to the necessary reduction in exploitation rate, which is regarded as being under the control of management and not constrained by the species biology.

The MSC wishes to avoid the situation in which fisheries appear in the upper left corner of a 'Kobe plot', with high exploitation rates even when stock size is reduced. The team should thus consider whether any condition on rebuilding could reasonably be achieved in less than the maximum 5-year period; for example, on an 'accelerated' 2-year timescale. The team should expect fisheries in this situation to begin effective rebuilding, and thereby meet SG80 for this PI, as fast as reasonably possible.

## GSA2.3.4 Scoring fishing mortality rate as evidence of rebuilding ▲

The MSC's expectation of rebuilding is that, for most stocks, scores of SG80 or SG100 will require F to be lower than FMSY, as described in SA2.3.4.a and 2.3.4.b. The alternative allowance in SA2.3.5 would apply only in exceptional circumstances where there is real demonstrated recovery in the stock even though F is not less than FMSY. This may still occur in some years; for example, in HCRs where F is specifically used as a target rather than a limit, as described in the examples in Box GSA5.

The alternative allowance in SA2.3.5 may also be temporarily acceptable following a series of recent high levels of recruitment due to good environmental conditions. In such cases, the 'alternative clear evidence that the stocks are rebuilding' should include that the stock has increased in at least the 'last 2 years', or other period as used in the assessment of the fishery. In these cases, the team should not accept evidence of only 1 year/period of growth as sufficient. In its scoring rationale in these cases, the team should include some understanding of why the stock is rebuilding even though F is higher than FMSY.

The team should consider the level of fishing mortality in cases where environmental variability appears to be affecting the ability of the stock to recover.

In situations where climatic cycles, for example decadal cycles, are shown to be reducing the potential of the stock to achieve good recruitment, SG80 or SG100 may still be justified when F is 'likely' or 'highly likely' below FMSY and the expectation is that good recruitment will be restored when climatic conditions permit. The team should also consider the target levels that are expected for rebuilding, consistent with GSA2.2.7.

## GSA2.4 Harvest strategy PI (PI 1.2.1)

## Scoring issue (a) - harvest strategy design ▲

Key elements of harvest strategies include:

- · The control rules and tools in place, including the ability of the management system to control effort, taking into account issues such as overcapacity and its causes.
- · The information base and monitoring stock status.
- · The responsiveness of the management system and fleet to stock status.

The CAB should also consider whether there are issues that might compromise the effectiveness of the harvest strategy, such as fishing overcapacity caused by subsidies. If overcapacity exists because of subsidies, the management system should be robust enough to deal with this issue and still deliver a sustainable fishery in accordance with MSC Principles 1 and 2.

The elements of the harvest strategy need to work together. The team should therefore consider:

- · The overall performance of the harvest strategy.
- · How its elements contribute to allowing the management system to be responsive to the state of the stock.

In terms of being responsive to the state of the stock, the team should provide evidence that the harvest strategy allows an adaptive management system. This could include demonstrating that the harvest strategy allows or has allowed the management authority to respond to issues in a clear, transparent, and consistent manner. This may include prior evidence of action that management has taken when shortcomings in the elements of the harvest strategy have been identified. A responsive harvest strategy should demonstrate that the management agency has acted, when required.

A responsive harvest strategy does not need a 'well-defined' HCR for it to be responsive.

For highly fluctuating or dynamic stocks that can have their stock status driven by environmental factors, a responsive harvest strategy should allow management to reduce exploitation to levels that are consistent with the natural environmental fluctuations. In such cases, the harvest strategy should allow management to alter exploitation in an adaptive manner, to levels that are appropriate for the stock to meet the objectives reflected in PI 1.1.1/PI 1.1.1A SG80 under fluctuating environmental conditions.

Additionally, for 'highly productive' species such as small pelagic fishes and invertebrates with short generation times (e.g. &lt; 1 year), there can be trade-offs between catch rates, fishery stability, and management and conservation objectives 23 . Because life history can affect such trade-offs 24 , the design of the harvest strategy should be appropriate for the species, and scoring should reflect this.

To achieve this, a robust management system may include:

- · Use of in-season monitoring and adjustments.
- · Consideration of long-term climactic changes such as regime shifts in the harvest strategy 25 .

- · Maintenance of buffers to account for uncertainty 26 .

## Assessing informal approaches against PI 1.2.1

- · The team should factor in to the assessment the likelihood of changes within the fishery that could lead to an increase in the risk of impact from fishing activity over time.
- · The team should consider how elements of the strategy are combining to ensure that the fishery is moving in the desired direction or operating at a low risk level.
- · The team should consider how qualitative or semi-quantitative objectives are being achieved.
- · The team should provide evidence that the expected objectives are being met. The team may demonstrate this evidence through local knowledge or research.
- · The team should determine the extent to which there is a feedback and learning mechanism to inform the harvest strategy on an ongoing basis. Depending on the scale of the fishery, this could be through:
- o Informal stakeholder processes that are based on local knowledge of the fishery, or
- o Any other less subjective review process.

<!-- image -->

## GSA2.4.1 Interpretation of terms ▲

As used in SI 1.2.1b at the 100 level, an 'evaluation' may range from a subjective stakeholder process in small-scale/data-deficient (SS/DD) fishery to quantitative management strategy evaluation as appropriate to the fishery.

For 'tested' at the SG80 level in SI 1.2.1b, the team can include:

- · The use of experience from analogous fisheries.
- · Empirical testing, for example practical experience of performance.
- · Evidence of past performance.
- · Simulation testing, for instance using computer-intensive modelling such as management strategy evaluation.

Teams should only assess that the harvest strategy is 'tested and expected to achieve its objectives', if there hasn't been an update to stock status following the implementation of the harvest strategy. Once there is an update to stock status after the direct implementation of the HS used to score PI 1.2.1, the team should assess if the HS is achieving the objectives of PI 1.1.1/1.1.1A.

For tested and evaluation in scoring issue (b) at the harvest-strategy level, the team should consider the full interactions between different components of the harvest strategy, including:

- · The HCRs.
- · Use of information.
- · Assessment of stock status.

SG100 for SI 1.2.1b requires a broader evaluation than that considered in the evaluation of the robustness of HCRs in SI 1.2.2b.

## GSA2.4.2 Setting conditions ▲

If conditions are set, changes to the HCRs or assessment method may be needed to make these conditions operational.

## GSA2.4.3-GSA2.4.4 Shark finning ▲

<!-- image -->

## Background

At its December 2011 meeting, the MSC Board of Trustees resolved that shark finning shall not be undertaken within MSC certified fisheries.

The intent of scoring shark finning in PIs 1.2.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.2 is to enable scoring the fishery on the CAB's level of certainty that shark finning is not taking place. These scoring issues are designed as a combination of policies and information thresholds determined by the evidence requirements, to assess the arrangements that are in place to ensure shark finning is not taking place.

## Fins naturally attached

A fins naturally attached (FNA) policy, as defined in the MSC-MSCI Vocabulary, needs to be in place for all retained sharks. Where reference is made to the requirement for FNA, in order to facilitate freezing and storage, the fishery could partially cut the fins, including for the purposes of draining blood to avoid ammoniation, and fold them around the carcasses. However, fins should be attached to a substantial part of the shark, not just some vertebrae, allowing the shark to be easily identified to the species level. If fins are removed and then artificially attached to the carcass via ropes or wire or placed into a bag that contains that carcass and fins, this would not constitute FNA.

## Non-retention policies

A non-retention policy, including species specific policies, is one where any captured individuals must be released and cannot be landed or retained in whole or in part. If a UoA operates under a nonretention policy, the same level of information accuracy determined through the evidence requirements applies to the implementation of an FNA policy.

## FNA policies

FNA policies can be included in regulations governing the management of sharks, including but not limited to prohibiting shark finning, such as:

- · Ratified RFMO conservation measures.
- · National or international memoranda of understanding or agreements.
- · National plans of action on sharks.
- · Legislation regulating the management and catch of sharks.
- · UoA/company level codes of conduct.

If a management agency has a requirement for FNA but it includes exemptions, the UoA should demonstrate that it is adhering to the FNA component. This may be from documented evidence that the UoA has put in place a code of conduct or policy that mandates its vessels operate with FNA.

## Evidence of shark finning

The team is required as per SA2.4.5 to apply the Evidence Requirements Framework in Tool B of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox to evaluate the accuracy of information used to score the sharkfinning scoring issue(s). This is to provide confidence in the team's determination that an FNA policy is in place. As part of this process, the team is required to:

- · Consider any documentation that supports the implementation of an FNA policy in practice.
- · Assess the appropriateness of enforcement in the UoA with respect to monitoring compliance with the FNA policy.

If there is objective verifiable evidence that indicates shark finning is taking place in the UoA, the CAB should not certify the UoA unless the client or client group excludes the vessel(s) involved from the UoA for 2 years, following procedures in FCP 7.4.

Objective verifiable evidence could be any documented statement of fact based on observations or measurements, or tests that can be verified.

If there is objective verifiable evidence that indicates shark finning is taking or has taken place on board a vessel that operates in a UoA/Unit of Certification (UoC) within the last two years:

- · The fishery client(s) should exclude the vessel from the UoA(s)/UoC(s).
- · The vessel should not operate in the UoA(s)/UoC(s).
- · The vessel will not be eligible to access any fishery certificate for two years from the date of exclusion.

## FCP G7.4.7 provides information on this process.

The date of exclusion is the date an updated vessel list was published on the Track a Fishery website. If fishery clients do not exclude vessels that are involved in shark finning practices, the CAB should not certify or maintain the certification of the fishery.

It does not matter where the vessel was operating, who was operating the vessel or who owned the vessel when the shark-finning incident took place, the MSC's intent is that any vessel involved in the practice of shark finning in the last two years is not eligible to access any MSC fishery certificate, cannot operate within any UoC, and cannot be an 'eligible fisher' in any UoA irrespective of ownership or name change.

Fishery clients and CABs should refer to the process for excluding an entity in FCP 7.4.5-7 for details on excluding vessels from the UoA(s)/UoC(s).

Note: the UoA is included in the text above (as well as the UoC). This is because UoAs can include 'other eligible fishers' that were considered in the full assessment but are not part of the UoC because they have not entered into a certificate-sharing mechanism. Please refer to FCP 7.5.11 and G7.5 for more information on 'other eligible fishers'. It is the MSC's intent that vessels identified as 'other eligible fishers' that have engaged in shark finning are excluded from accessing the certificate via the certificate-sharing mechanism. In order to implement this intent, the CAB and client should not list these vessels as 'other eligible fishers'.

## Scenario 1: Evidence of shark finning is identified during a full assessment

If, during a fishery assessment, the team identifies objective verifiable evidence that indicates shark finning is taking place on board vessels that operate in the UoA, the vessel(s) engaged in the shark finning should be excluded from the UoA.

## Scenario 2: Evidence of shark finning is identified during a surveillance audit

At each surveillance audit the team should review observer data, and other sources of information, in order to detect whether shark finning has taken place on board vessels that operate in the UoA(s)/UoC(s) in the last two years or since the last surveillance audit. If the CAB identifies objective verifiable evidence that shark finning is taking place on board vessels that operate in the UoA(s)/UoC(s), they should immediately inform the fishery client. The fishery client should exclude those vessels from those UoA(s)/UoC(s) and ensure the vessels do not have access to the certificate.

## Scenario 3: Evidence of shark finning is identified between surveillance audits

Fishery clients may regularly review observer data, and other sources of information, between surveillance audits in order to detect whether shark finning is taking place on board vessels that operate in their UoA(s)/UoC(s). Fishery clients may receive information from other fishery clients or stakeholders that indicates shark finning is taking place on board vessels that operate in their UoA(s)/UoC(s). As soon as fishery clients become aware that shark finning is taking place on board vessels that operate in their UoA(s)/UoC(s), they should:

- · Exclude those vessels from those UoA(s)/UoC(s).
- · Ensure the vessels do not have access to the fishery certificate.
- · Inform their CAB immediately.

The MSC's intent is that if fishery clients are aware that shark finning is taking place on board vessels that operate in their UoA(s)/UoC(s), they should not wait until a surveillance audit before taking action and informing their CAB. This would contravene the MSC's position that shark finning is not to be undertaken within MSC certified fisheries. If a fishery client has not excluded vessels involved in shark finning from their UoA(s)/UoC(s), the MSC's intent is clearly stated in the MSC Fisheries Standard 1.1.6.

## GSA2.5 Harvest control rules and tools PI (PI 1.2.2) ▲

For LTL species, for the fishery to score 60 or above under PI 1.1.1A, the TRPs and LRPs need to take into account the ecological role of the stock for the fishery. The harvest strategy, control rules, information requirements, and assessment need to be consistent with this distinction. When PI 1.1.1A is scored, the team should interpret references to PI 1.1.1 in the guidance below as PI 1.1.1A and the objectives required therein.

There may be conceptual differences in the reference points when scoring PI 1.1.1 and PI 1.2.2. This is because fisheries may use different reference points for measuring stock status and as triggers in the HCRs 27 . For example, a fishery that uses an explicit BMSY reference point as a target for the fishery biomass may have TRPs for adjusting F at values of biomass either at BMSY, or above or below BMSY. The focus in this PI is thus on the reference points used in a fishery to trigger changes in management actions, and how they work in combination to achieve the outcomes required in PI 1.1.1.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - HCR design and application ▲

The team should consider the basis for plausibility and practicality of design in relation to the scale and intensity of the fishery; for example, using:

- · Empirical information.
- · Relevant science.
- · Model-based approaches, such as management procedures and management strategy evaluation.

The team should score HCRs against their ability to deliver the levels expressed in scoring issue (a).

- · At SG 60 , HCRs should be 'likely' to ensure that stocks will be maintained above the PRI.
- · At SG 80 , HCRs should also ensure that the stock is 'likely' to fluctuate around a BMSY level. Testing may show that this is achieved by the inclusion of a BMSY consistent reference point as a trigger in the HCRs, such as an inflection in a 'hockey stick' form, at a point that would deliver BMSY in the long term.
- · At SG 100 , greater certainty is required. The team should regard fisheries with HCRs that target stock levels above BMSY, for example a biomass that maximises net economic returns (BMEY), as at least meeting the 80 level. Projections in the fishery may show that the HCR would 'likely' achieve the higher SG100 score by fluctuating more above than around BMSY.

HCRs will usually include some form of dynamic rule, requiring that a change of some sort will be made in response to a fishery indicator moving above or below one of the TRPs. In lightly exploited fisheries, it may be that some reference points are set to trigger changes in data collection or assessment approaches, as certain thresholds are reached 28 .

HCRs are often applied on a frequent basis, such as with the annual setting of total allowable catch (TAC) or effort restrictions.

- · Such HCRs respond dynamically to the monitoring data from the fishery with regular adjustments to input/output-type management measures.
- · In data-poor fisheries that are managed without such input/output controls, management may comprise only technical measures, such as size limits, gear restrictions, closed seasons, and closed areas.
- o In these cases, the specific terms of the technical measures are usually set and fixed for a relatively long period of time, several years, based on occasional strategic stock assessments that are shown to deliver defined TRPs or LRPs.
- o The team may regard such an arrangement as equivalent to a dynamic HCR operating over a longer time scale in cases where some indicators are monitored to confirm that the HCRs are delivering the intended targets for the stock.
- · For 'highly productive' species, the design of the HCR should consider life history, as this can affect performance of the control rule. Given the propensity for changes in productivity with these species, adaptive and responsive control rules are key to assist with detecting and responding to changes in biomass 29 .

At SG80 in scoring issue (a), the team should expect 'well-defined' HCRs to explicitly include the conditions under which the technical measures in the fishery would be expected to be revised in the future.

## Example

Relatively sedentary bivalves often have fishery management trigger points based on population densities collected through systematic surveys, where these index densities are established based on the species population dynamics and the inherent productivity of the habitat and environmental conditions.

There may be no formal stock assessment, but yield is calculated on a proportion of the observed biomass, and the harvested fraction determined on empirical evidence from historical catches and their consequences.

The team should note that, while such arrangements can work, HCRs based on taking a constant percentage of the year's estimated biomass should not be regarded as meeting the requirement of avoiding the PRI, unless some lower threshold is defined.

The CAB should not always interpret the requirement that an HCR reduces exploitation rates as the LRP is approached as requiring the control rule to deliver an exploitation rate that is a monotonically decreasing function of stock size:

- · Any exploitation rate function may be acceptable if it acts to keep the stock above an LRP that avoids possible recruitment failure and attempts to maintain the stock at a TRP that is consistent with BMSY or a similar 'highly productive' level.
- · This outcome includes the requirement that the HCR should act to cause stocks to rebuild to the TRP when they are below it; maintenance of a stock at a level just above the LRP would not be acceptable.

29 Pikitch, E., Boersma, P.D., Boyd, I.L., Conover, D.O., Cury, P., Essington, T., Heppell, S.S., Houde, E.D., Mangel, M., Pauly, D., Plagányi, É., Sainsbury, K., and Steneck, R.S. (2012). Little Fish, Big Impact: Managing a Crucial Link in Ocean Food Webs . Lenfest Ocean Program. Washington, DC. 108 pp.

- · A reduction of exploitation rate may not always mean that the control rule requires a reduction in 'total' exploitation rate, but instead could involve reducing exploitation rate on parts of the stock; for example, by age or sex.
- · The team should assume that reductions in exploitation rate refer primarily to reductions in catches and effort, and not to gear modifications, unless these have the effect of reducing catches/effort.

As noted in the guidance on PI 1.1.1, HCRs may include both explicit and implicit reference points.

## Example

If a management strategy is based solely around a TRP, the HCR, when combined with TRP, should ensure that the stock remains well above the PRI. This should ensure that the exploitation rate is reduced as this point is approached. This is an implied LRP.

Equally, a management strategy based solely around an LRP should imply that there is a TRP close to or at BMSY, or some other measure or surrogate that maintains the stock at high productivity, and at a level that is well above the LRP.

## GSA2.5.2 'Generally understood' HCRs at SG60 vs 'well-defined' HCRs at SG80 ▲

For 'generally understood' and in-place HCRs, there should be at least some implicit agreement supported by past management actions that demonstrates that 'generally understood' rules exist. There should be the expectation that management will continue to follow such 'generally understood' rules in future and act when changes in explicit or implicit reference points are identified.

When determining whether a 'generally understood' HCR is in place in the fishery under assessment, the team needs to determine whether the fishery will take appropriate management action in line with what they perceive as the 'generally understood' rule. The team should consider evidence of positive action being taken in the past as evidence that there is a 'generally understood' rule in place. The team should provide clear reference to documents or other evidence that actions were taken on specific dates.

The team should provide evidence and examples of the positive actions taken in response to generally understood HCRs for the target stock when they are in place.

The team should apply a precautionary approach to scoring when there is uncertainty over whether an HCR meets the requirements of 'generally understood', and whether there is sufficient evidence to support this. Note, the full definition for HCRs in the MSC-MSCI Vocabulary should only apply at the SG80 level, given the term 'well-defined' is used in this definition.

The team should not consider the following as evidence that an HCR is in place:

- · A poorly defined commitment such as 'we agree to implement an HCR sometime in the future'.
- · General regulations, such as convention texts or references to the Fish Stocks Agreement.
- o However, binding commitments such as those in national law may be used as evidence, if supported by evidence of management action.
- · Scientific recommendations on HCRs or reference points that have not yet been adopted by the actual management agency.

The team should not expect that 'in place' arrangements require formal indefinite binding agreement. For example, CMMs approved by RFMO Commissions are regarded as 'active' resolutions and may thus be accepted as in place even though they may be overturned in the future.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - scoring uncertainty in the HCRs ▲

The SGs reflect the degree of confidence there is in the HCR performance in relation to risks caused by known and unknown factors.

Known factors include:

- · Observation and process errors that are often accounted for in stock assessments.

Unknown factors include:

- · Unpredictable effects from climate.
- · Environmental or anthropogenic non-fishery related factors, which could, for example, lead to periods of low recruitment or growth.
- · High natural mortality.
- · Migration.

These and other changes to the population dynamics may not have been fully accounted for in the stock assessment or projections. Another important reason for limited confidence in an HCR is that it has not been fully agreed by stakeholders, and it is uncertain whether the fishing community will comply with the HCR. This last issue is important to ensure HCRs are not only theoretical rules on paper but are applied in practice.

The team can use testing to support the requirement that the control rules and/or management actions are designed to take into account uncertainty. Testing can include:

- · The use of experience from analogous fisheries.
- · Empirical testing; for example, practical experience of performance or evidence of past performance.
- · Simulation testing, for instance using computer-intensive modelling such as management strategy evaluation.

It may generally be the case that LRPs are set at the point that reproductive capacity starts to be appreciably impaired for some fisheries, especially those for small pelagic species and annual species where the stock recruit relationship is very steep. However, management may choose to set an LRP above this level. Maintaining a buffer can allow for adaptability to changes in production 30 . Where this results in more precautionary management, it may assist the fishery in meeting SG80 or SG100 for scoring issue (b).

HCRs in small-scale fisheries may still achieve high scores if uncertainties are well considered. The team may thus score simple HCRs linked to reliable indices of stock status highly on this issue without management strategy evaluations.

## GSA2.5.4 Evaluating the effectiveness of HCRs - PI1.2.2 scoring issue (c) ▲

In this scoring issue, the team is required review the ability of the tools associated with the HCRs to achieve the exploitation levels. Such tools include:

- · Management measures like TACs and fishing limits.
- · Arrangements for sharing TACs between participants in the fishery, including between states in shared stock fisheries.

For this examination, the team may consider the overall history of effectiveness of the tools used in the fishery, in terms of their ability to achieve the desired exploitation rates and biomass levels, and the current status.

30 Pikitch, E., Boersma, P.D., Boyd, I.L., Conover, D.O., Cury, P., Essington, T., Heppell, S.S., Houde, E.D., Mangel, M., Pauly, D., Plagányi, É., Sainsbury, K., and Steneck, R.S. (2012) Little Fish, Big Impact: Managing a Crucial Link in Ocean Food Webs. Lenfest Ocean Program. Washington, DC. 108 pp.

SA2.5.4 requires that the team examine the current exploitation levels in the fishery, as part of the evidence that the HCRs are working, for example through evidence that current F is equal to or less than FMSY. The team may also accept current F levels greater than FMSY in cases where:

- · Stock biomass is currently higher than BMSY, or
- · Stock assessment information is comprehensive and it is appropriate to treat FMSY as a TRP (see Box GSA5).

However, the team should not use F &lt; FMSY as the sole evidence for the existence of an effective HCR. F could, for example, be lower than FMSY just because effort is currently low, even though there has been no management commitment or attempts to actually control effort at a level that would constrain F to FMSY by the HCR. However, if F has been constrained at F &lt; FMSY by the tools, the team could accept this as part of the evidence that the HCRs are being effective. Evidence for the effectiveness of an HCR should in fact require the consistent achievement of the target exploitation level, which may be well below FMSY if stocks are currently below BMSY. The team should take particular care when assessing the effectiveness of capacity limitation measures in fisheries, for example in comparison to well-monitored effort controls and catch limits, in terms of their likely ability to meet management goals and target exploitation levels.

To avoid severe socio-economic impacts in a fishery, the team may also make allowance for the gradual adjustment of F down to appropriate levels in cases where the pace of change is limited. In these cases, projections of stock status should confirm that the expected future adjustments in F will still lead to fluctuations around MSY levels within a reasonable timescale.

If proxy indicators and reference points are used in the fishery instead of explicit estimates of F and FMSY (as allowed in SA2.2.3), the team should assign higher scores where greater confidence is provided by the proxy information, similar to the scoring of PI 1.1.1. Where higher scores are justified by the use of 2 or more proxy indicators, they should be independent of each other and be expected to be proxies of the quantity of interest, such as mean fish size in the case of exploitation rates. The team should present a rationale for how the proxies conform to these principles.

As with the case of using proxies for scoring stock biomass in PI 1.1.1, it may sometimes be argued that 1 good proxy is better than 2 or more weak proxies.

## Examples: SG60, SG80, and SG100 levels

Examples of how the team may justify SG60, SG80, and SG100 in these situations:

- · At least SG60 is justified if 1 proxy indicates that 'overfishing' is not occurring.
- · At least SG80 is justified if 1 or more proxies indicate that it is 'likely' that 'overfishing' is not occurring. In this case, the extra confidence may be due to the availability of a second proxy indicator, or may arise because a minimum 70% probability level can be assigned to the single indicator used, as compared to the SG60 level where this probability level may not be demonstrated.
- · SG100 is justified if 2 or more proxies indicate it is 'highly likely' that 'overfishing' is not occurring.

## Assessing informal approaches to HCRs

In informally managed fisheries, the CAB should assess the extent to which there are management tools and measures in place that are consistent with ensuring that susceptibility of the target species to removal is no higher than that which would cause the risk to the target species to be above an acceptable risk range. Measures could be spatial, temporal, or changes to gear overlap.

The team should also consider measures in place to respond to changes in the fishery, for example by reducing the susceptibility of target species when the fishery is not heading in the direction of its objectives.

## Metapopulations

The team should address uncertainties relating to the metapopulation structure. The team should note the descriptions of different types of metapopulation in FCP G7.5.

## GSA2.6 Information monitoring PI (PI 1.2.3)

## GSA2.6.3 Information categories ▲

Stock structure could incorporate information describing:

- · The distribution and geographical range of the stock.
- · The relationship of the geographical range to the harvest control.
- · The age, size, sex, and genetic structure of the stock.

## Stock productivity could incorporate:

- · Maturity.
- · Growth.
- · Natural mortality.
- · Density-dependent processes.
- · The stock-recruit relationship.
- · Fecundity.

Fleet composition could incorporate information on associated effort by gear type/method of capture, including fleet characteristics in both targeted and non-targeted fisheries taking the species. Information is required for the whole stock, but better information would usually be expected from the fishery unit under assessment.

Stock abundance could incorporate information relating to absolute or relative abundance indices including:

- · Recruitment.
- · Age.
- · Size.
- · Sex.
- · Genetic structure of the stock.
- o Reflecting the guidance on surrogate measures under PI 1.1.1, the team may meet the requirement for 'stock abundance' information at SG60 and SG80 by using surrogate indicators that provide an adequate proxy for stock abundance.

Fishery removals could incorporate information describing:

- · The level, size, age, sex, and genetic structure of landings.
- · Discards.
- · Illegal, unreported, unregulated, recreational, customary, and incidental mortality of the target stock by location and method of capture.

Information is required for the whole stock, but better information would usually be expected from the fishery being assessed.

Other data may include environmental information such as temperature, weather, and other factors that may influence fish populations and fishing.

## Scoring issues (b) and (c) - scoring fishery removals ▲

The distinction between scoring issues (b) and (c) for PI 1.2.3 at SG80 relates to the relative amount or quality of information required on fishery removals.

Scoring issue (b) relates to fishery removals specifically by those vessels covered under the UoA, which need to be regularly monitored and have a level of accuracy and coverage consistent with the HCR. For example, where depletion methods are used, they should be tested against catch and effort data at a determined frequency consistent with the HCR; for example, weekly, or monthly.

The reference to 'other' fishery removals in scoring issue (c) relates to vessels outside or not covered by the UoA. These require good information but not necessarily to the same level of accuracy or coverage as that covered by scoring issue (b).

## Metapopulations

Understanding dispersal pathways and population connectivity is important for devising effective harvest strategies. The team should specifically address information related to the metapopulation structure.

Information that could be relevant to the assessment includes:

- · The life cycle of the species, including its spatial distribution and temporal distribution.
- · Identification of local populations and the extent to which they are connected and function as either sinks or sources, reflecting the dispersal of both larvae and adult.
- · The role of oceanographic features or any other mechanisms in controlling larval dispersal and connectivity.
- · Genetic studies comparing local populations.
- · Variations in population structure.
- · Variations in demographic parameters between sources and sinks.

## GSA2.7 Assessment of stock status PI (PI 1.2.4) ▲

## Background

This PI refers to stock assessments, but in some circumstances, particularly under SG100, the team may find it useful to consider whether management procedure / management strategy evaluation approaches were used to test the robustness of the stock assessment to uncertainty and alternative hypotheses.

For some harvest strategies, stock assessment methods may not be model-based but based on stock status relative to empirical reference points; for example, catch rate and density. Survey abundance, and decision rules may comprise rules using these indices rather than stock status estimates from analytical assessments. Other harvest strategies may use complex analytical models.

The 'default' reference points described in GSA2.2.4 are equivalent to the 'generic' reference points referred to in PI 1.2.4.

For example, when scoring PI 1.2.4b at SG60, an assessment might use the BMSY = 40%B0 and/or PRI = 20%B0 values. While at SG80, the fishery may have estimated its own BMSY for the stock (e.g. 35%B0). Note the expectation that these levels may be adjusted for different types of stock (mainly whether they are long-lived/slow-growing, or short-lived/fast growing).

## Short-lived species

Assessment of cephalopods can prove challenging because of aspects of their life history and because there are fewer analytical stock assessments available than for finfish. As such, application of assessment methods may be successful for some stocks but not others. For example, some species may experience complete replacement of the population at every generational cycle, causing there to be few or no other cohorts. For these stocks, sequential analysis of cohorts may then not be a suitable form of assessment. The team needs to consider:

- · The nature of the stock.
- · Whether the assessment method is appropriate and able to model any rapid changes.

## Metapopulations

Where several or many local populations exist within a metapopulation, it is unlikely that full stock assessments would be completed annually for each local population. The degree of self-recruitment and demographic connectivity among sub-populations should dictate the specific assessment required to allow for responsible and sustainable harvest.

The team should consider the appropriateness of the stock assessment in relation to the metapopulation structure.

The team should also assess whether the stock assessment identifies and considers major sources of uncertainty related to the metapopulation structure.

## GSA3 Principle 2 ▲

## Background

The Principle 2 assessment is divided into four components, which are considered to cover the range of potential impacts of the UoA on the ecosystem.

Table GSA1: Components of Principle 2

| Component        | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-scope species | Species within scope of the MSC program (fish and invertebrates) that are  not covered under Principle 1 and are not ETP/OOS species.              |
| ETP/OOS species  | Endangered, threatened, or protected (ETP) species and species out of  scope (OOS) of the MSC program (birds, mammals, amphibians, and  reptiles). |
| Habitats         | The chemical and bio-physical environment, including biogenic structures,  where fishing takes place.                                              |
| Ecosystem        | Broader ecosystem elements such as trophic structure and function,  community composition, and biological diversity.                               |

## GSA3.1 General requirements for Principle 2 ▲

In Principle 2, the MSC uses the term 'species' in scoring issues and requirements. The term could mean an entire species, or a stock or population of a species, as appropriate to the species and the context of the UoA.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.1.1.d Negligible interactions ▲

The 'negligible' criteria are provided for out-of-scope species using the number of individuals rather than weight. However, recognising that for many fish and invertebrate species the catch is reported by weight, a threshold of &lt; 2% of UoA catch is applied.

Where the team is aware of a significant risk of recruitment impairment or stock collapse from catches below 2%, the team should take a precautionary approach and should not consider interactions with these species negligible.

## GSA3.1.1.d.ii Exceptionally large ▲

<!-- image -->

The team should interpret 'exceptionally large' as being when the UoA catch is equal to or greater than 400,000mt. If the catch is 'exceptionally large', even small catch proportions of a Principle 2 species could significantly impact populations, and therefore the team should not exclude these species from further assessment.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.1.1.e Unwanted catch ▲

Where a UoA has a management plan, some species and sizes may be considered and designated to be 'unwanted catch' (including through using terms such as 'non-target', 'bycatch' or 'discards' in the plan). If not designated, unwanted catch of species are those that are not covered under the plan. Unwanted catches of species may also be designated as catch that is prohibited in that fishery.

Unwanted catch may also include the part of the catch that has been thrown away or slipped where the components of that catch may not survive after release.

## GSA3.2.1 Identification of Principle 2 species and documented interactions ▲

To identify Principle 2 species the team should use information on UoA interactions covering the latest five years. The team should provide a rationale for the time series used if it is shorter than five years.

Documented interactions could include information from, inter alia :

- · Fisher logbooks.
- · Reports from observers or electronic monitoring.
- · Research projects where the fishery operates related to similar gear or species.
- · Assessments or other types of evaluation by the relevant management body.

The team should use their expert judgement to consider additional species to those with which the UoA has a documented interaction, for example in situations where there is a high risk of interactions with an ETP/OOS species that may not be recorded or reflected in the above information.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.2.3 'Negligible' interactions ▲

As per GSA3.1.1.d, where the team is aware of a significant risk of recruitment impairment or stock collapse from catches below 2%, the team should take a precautionary approach and should not treat these scoring elements as negligible.

## GSA3.2.3.2.b Opting to score species with which the UoA has 'negligible interactions' ▲

The team may, in consultation with the fishery client, score species with which the UoA has negligible interactions. This may be of interest to fishery clients where they have made progress towards improving selectivity of catch, reducing the amount of catch of species in a component to the point where they are now caught in negligible quantities.

In order to score species with which the UoA has a 'negligible' interaction, the team should categorise and score all species under the relevant component (i.e. in-scope species or ETP/OOS species component). The team may choose to only score one component.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.2.4 Categorisation of Principle 2 species ▲

Principle 2 species are species impacted by the UoA and not under assessment in Principle 1. Figure GSA3 provides an overview of the MSC's intent of the separation of in-scope and ETP/OOS species components. The team should use Figure GSA3 in conjunction with the decision tree in Figure SA3 to categorise species under the in-scope and ETP/OOS species components.

Figure GSA3: High level overview of Principle 2 species designations

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.2.7.e National ETP legislation ▲

The MSC's intent in specifying National ETP legislation as a categorisation criterion is that species listed in relevant national legislative frameworks are done so in response to their ETP status. National ETP legislation may take many forms but examples include:

- · Primary legislation 31  - this legislation usually outlines general principles and provides powers for further regulation. The term describes the main laws passed by the legislative bodies of a country. Examples can include an 'Act' or 'Bill'.
- · Secondary legislation 32  - this legislation usually consists of more detailed provisions covering a particular subject. The term describes laws created under powers granted through primary legislation. An example can include a 'Statutory Instrument'.

Legislation that allows for managed (for example has target or limit reference points, stock management objectives, management plan with abundance objectives or quotas) fisheries targeting a species should not be considered as 'national ETP legislation' for the purpose of categorising the species. Examples of legislation that allows managed fisheries to target species listed in National ETP legislation include:

- · Fish or invertebrates listed in the 'conservation-dependent' category of the threatened species list under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 33  in Australia.
- · Fish or invertebrates listed on Species At Risk Act Schedule 1 34  in Canada, where the management plan sets out management goals with specific measures for fisheries.

If there is legislation that allows managed fisheries to target a species listed in National ETP legislation, the team should categorise the species as a scoring element under the in-scope species component unless it is listed on any of the other lists in SA3.2.7.

If the team is unsure whether a species is listed in 'National ETP legislation' as per SA3.2.7.b, the team should apply the precautionary principle and categorise the species as ETP/OOS.

## GSA3.2.10.d Bait species ▲

Bait is always assessed as a scoring element within the in-scope species component since use of ETP/OOS species is not consistent with the MSC's intent. Wild-caught bait, whether caught within the fishery or purchased from elsewhere, needs to be considered in an assessment because all aspects of the fishery need to be sustainable, including those relating to the stocks of the bait species. Therefore, the team should present rationale that even purchased bait comes from well-managed and healthy stocks.

Bait from sources other than wild-capture fisheries, such as terrestrial origin products or aquaculture by-products are beyond the MSC's bait requirements. The team should not consider such products as scoring elements under the in-scope species component. However, when scoring the ecosystem PIs, the team may consider the impact on the ecosystem of using these products.

## GSA3.3 General requirements for outcome PIs ▲

The outcome PIs assess the status of each component and whether the UoA is posing a risk of serious or irreversible harm to the component or hindering its recovery.

## GSA3.3.1 Interpretation of likelihood levels ▲

The team may interpret the terms in Table SA8 either:

- · Qualitatively, for example, through analogy with similar situations, plausible argument, empirical observation of sustainability and qualitative risk assessment, or
- · Quantitatively, for example, through measured data from the relevant fishery, statistical analysis, quantitative risk assessment and quantitative modelling.

Table GSA2 shows the MSC's intent for the maintenance of each P2 component in relation to sustainability levels.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

Table GSA2: MSC outcome expectations for each P2 component

| Term               | Definition and discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-scope  (2.1.1)  | The intent of the SGs is that a fishery is managed such that the stock biomass is  maintained above the PRI. This reflects the language used for PI 1.1.1.  Where the PRI is not defined by management, other biologically based limits (BBL) or  proxies can be used to score this PI (see GSA2.2.3 on proxies).                     |
| ETP/OOS  (2.2.1)   | The intent is that the UoA does not hinder the recovery of ETP/OOS populations to  favourable conservation status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Habitats  (2.3.1)  | The SGs refer to the changes caused by the UoA that fundamentally alter the capacity  of the habitat to maintain its ecological structure and function or recover from the  impact.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ecosystem  (2.4.1) | Changes caused by the fishery that fundamentally alter the capacity of the ecosystem to  maintain its key structure and function or recover from the impact. The team may  interpret this to mean changes that seriously reduce the ecosystem services provided  by the component to the fishery, to other fisheries, and human uses. |

The components of Principle 2 may be subject to human impact from sources other than the UoA. For example, in-scope species may be target species in other fisheries, while habitats and ecosystem processes may be impacted by coastal-zone or other developments or introduced species.

If the component status is low, for whatever reason, the operative issue for the majority of the SGs in Principle 2 assessments is whether the UoA is hindering recovery. In these cases, the team should base the assessment on the contribution that the UoA makes to the status or recovery of the component under consideration. If the UoA is not the root cause of human impacts on the component, actions of the UoA cannot redress the situation.

## GSA3.3.4 Observed and unobserved mortality ▲

Observed mortality includes:

- · Catches.
- · Catches that are thrown away, including slippage.

Unobserved mortality includes, but is not limited to:

- · Illegal fishing and/or unregulated catches.
- · Animals that are injured and subsequently die as result of coming in contact with fishing gear.
- · Animals that are stressed and die as a result of attempting to avoid being caught by fishing gear.
- · Ghost gear impacts (GSA3.7.7-8).

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.4 General requirements for management PIs ▲

## Management arrangements

The intent of the management PIs is to assess the arrangements in place to manage the impact that the UoA has on the P2 scoring elements to ensure that it does not pose a risk of serious or irreversible harm to the components of the ecosystem. The SGs contain a mixture of requirements for either measures or strategies to be in place. In addition to the definitions provided in SA3.4.1, the

team should use Table GSA3, which provides a summary of requirements at each SG, when assessing management arrangements.

Measures could include the closure of an area that was primarily put in place to avoid the catch of juvenile target species and enhance target species sustainability, but also has a beneficial effect on other species caught by the UoA, such as other juvenile finfish.

A partial strategy may not have been designed to manage the impact on that component specifically. However, if such measures are effective in assisting the UoA to achieve the SG80 level for the outcome PI, this could be considered as sufficient in meeting the criteria for partial strategy.

A strategy could include voluntary or customary arrangements, agreements, or practices, and/or codes of practice where they can be demonstrated to be working by achieving the corresponding outcome PI at SG80 or higher.

A comprehensive strategy , only used in the ETP/OOS management PIs, requires that the management ensures and continues to confirm that the UoA achieves the corresponding outcome requirements.

## 'Alternative measures'

The Management PIs also assess 'alternative measures' to minimise the impact of the UoA on species and habitats. Fishery clients need to review 'alternative measures' that are shown to minimise mortality of the species or species group in question as well as 'alternative measures' to reduce impacts on habitats.

Box GSA7: The MSC's intent on reducing the impact of fisheries on unwanted catch and on habitats

The FAO states that:

Selective and environmentally safe fishing gear and practices should be further developed and applied, to the extent practicable, to maintain biodiversity and to conserve the population structure

and aquatic ecosystems and protect fish quality. Where proper selective and environmentally safe fishing gear and practices exist, they should be recognized and accorded a priority in establishing conservation and management measures for fisheries 35 .

- · Fisheries should take account of the potential for both positive and negative impacts of 'alternative measures' on species and habitats (refer to GSA3.7.2.1) when considering whether such measures should be implemented.

'Alternative measures' should avoid capture of the species in the first place or increase its survivability if released. Alternatively, in the case of in-scope species, measures could use the unwanted catch in some way so that it would no longer be 'unwanted'. If there are no 'unwanted' species, the team does not need to score the issue on reviewing 'alternative measures' in that PI.

The language used in the scoring issue is based on that used by the FAO 36 . The FAO also provides management planning guidelines for all significant sources of fishing mortality in a fishery and requirements for management actions pertaining to bycatch and discards 37 , including:

- · Reviewing effectiveness of existing initiatives to address bycatch and discard problems.
- · Reviewing potential effectiveness of alternative methods to address the bycatch/discard problem.

The MSC's intent is that the team should, in the outcome and information PIs, consider the efforts of the UoA to minimise the mortality of this 'unwanted' catch. The team should score information on the effectiveness of the measures, including any reduction of unwanted catch, for example, lower catch rate, in the information PI. This information on the reduced catch rate of the species may improve certainty that a species is above the PRI/biologically based limits or, if below PRI/biologically based limits, form part of a strategy to ensure that the MSC UoAs do not collectively hinder recovery of this species. The team should also consider this when scoring the outcome PI.

The arrangements in place to manage impacts on the species may include measures to address both wanted and unwanted catch (see Box GSA7). With respect to unwanted catch, measures may include:

- · Input and/or output controls.
- · Improvements of the design and use of fishing gear and unwanted catch-mitigation devices.
- · Spatial and temporal measures.
- · Limits and/or quotas on unwanted catch.
- · Bans on throwing away or slipping catch that create an incentive to reduce unwanted catch, provided that the unwanted catch cannot be released alive.
- · Measures to increase survivorship of unwanted catch that is thrown away or slipped.
- · Incentives for fishers to comply with measures to manage and/or reduce mortality of unwanted catch.

In these PIs, the team should also consider incentives that might compromise the effectiveness of the management strategy meeting P2 outcomes, such as fishing overcapacity caused by subsidies. If overcapacity exists due to subsidies, the management system should be robust enough to deal with this issue and still deliver a sustainable fishery in accordance with MSC Principle 2.

## GSA3.5 General requirements for information PIs ▲

The requirements in the information PIs are framed in terms of information adequacy. The team may use many forms of information in order to score the UoA; for example, written, verbal, photographs, and first-hand accounts. This information may come from different, potentially competing sources; for example, the client, fishers, community members, non-governmental organisations, and government agencies.

For some forms of information, support can be derived from published scientific literature that refers directly or indirectly to the subject of interest, from the client or stakeholders, or from first-hand observations. The team will need to be satisfied that information:

- · Is objective.
- · Has been generated through acceptable scientific methods.
- · Can be independently verified.

When presented with information that may not be verifiable, the team may find it useful to 'triangulate opinions'. The team can do this by cross-checking statements made by people against other opinions and perspectives held by other stakeholders. A range of triangulated opinions will:

- · Offer different perspectives, highlight diverse views, or potentially reveal vested interests.
- · Help verify or authenticate information.
- · Challenge the assumptions or biases of others.

Triangulation may not reveal the one true answer; it may simply yield a fuller, more complete understanding when all the information is brought together. Ultimately, the team will need to use its expert judgement and make decisions based on the best available information, independent of its source.

## GSA3.6.1

Determining the point of recruitment impairment and the use of proxies ▲

For additional help on the interpretation of this term, including the use of proxy reference points, the team should refer to the Principle 1 guidance in GSA2.2.3.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.6.2 Designation of 'main' and 'minor' species ▲

When considering species for designation as 'main', the team should use a precautionary approach.

The overall intent when designating 'main' species is that the team should have a good understanding of the long-term average catch composition of P2 species of the UoA before it publishes the Public Comment Draft Report. In addition, the team should be confident that the species compositions, as well as their respective catch volumes, are unlikely to change over the lifetime of the certificate.

Considering the variability of the catch composition over the last 5 years or fishing seasons, the team should recognise that some species might be 'main' in some years but not in others. Depending on data availability, the team may choose a different length of the time series. However, the team should provide a rationale for the duration chosen.

If catch percentages are unknown or too uncertain to enable determination of which species are 'main', the team should use and document a qualitative information-gathering process to determine whether the catch of the species by the UoA comprises more than 2% or 5% of all species caught by the UoA. The team should be precautionary in its classification of 'main' and 'minor species'. This implies that more species might be considered 'main' unless the team provides rationale to justify otherwise. This might be the case for fisheries that need to use the Risk-Based Framework (RBF)

methodology (Tool A of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox) and/or have very low sample sizes so that the standard deviation is very high.

## GSA3.6.3.b Designating less-resilient species as 'main' at 2% ▲

Resilience here is based on the species life-history characteristics and the risk to the stock from anthropogenic activities, not the actual impact of the UoA on the stock. The team should assess the actual impact of the UoA on the stock under the outcome PI.

The team may use the productivity part of the Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) as a precautionary and robust method of quickly determining the intrinsic resilience of a species, in cases where it scores either low or medium productivity (SA3.6.3.b.i.A). The team may take an overall average productivity score of ≥ 2 to indicate that the species has a life-history equivalent to medium or lower productivity. Using this threshold would be a precautionary way of designating a species as 'less resilient'. See of the Tool A of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox for full details on the PSA analysis.

However, the team should note that the productivity score is not the only method available to help designate species as 'less resilient'. A wide variety of other sources of information can also be used, either apart from or in combination with the productivity score. For example, Fishbase provides designations for some species as being either of low, medium or high resilience/productivity.

If the intrinsic resilience is high but the species is still at risk for other reasons, the team could consider investigating species declines, population size, and extrinsic threats. For example, the current abundance of the population may affect natural resilience if depensation effects are apparent and impair natural reproductive ability.

The team may also consider the spatial distribution of the species and the degree of spatial overlap with commercial fishing operations to determine 1 of the following:

- · Whether the species is at risk of being locally depleted in the assessment area.
- · Whether the species has only a limited distribution, so is likely to be more severely affected by fishing pressure.

Whether the species is part of a widely distributed and highly migratory population, in which case the cumulative impacts on the population may be greater and more difficult to account for.

## GSA3.6.3.c Sharks ▲

Shark fins are considered to have high commercial value. Thus, when a fishery trades shark fins, the team should consider shark to be a main species, even when sharks comprise less than 5% of the catch.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.6.3.1 Exceptionally large catch ▲

The team should interpret 'exceptionally large' as when the UoA catch is equal to or greater than 400,000mt. If the catch is exceptionally large, even small catch proportions of a Principle 2 species could significantly impact populations, and therefore the team may still designate a species as 'main' if it falls under the designated weight thresholds of 5%.

Where the team is aware of a significant risk of recruitment impairment or stock collapse, the team should take a precautionary approach and may still designate a species as 'main' if it falls under the designated weight thresholds of 5%.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.6.7 Species below the PRI ▲

The team should note, at SG80, that the recovery of a species in P2 that is below the PRI (or other limit with similar intent and outcome) is only required to levels above the PRI or biologically based limit, and not to the MSY or equivalent target levels required in P1, as specifically referred to in PI 1.1.2 on stock rebuilding. P1 and P2 set critically different bars in this regard.

The team may find it useful to first evaluate whether recovery of a species below the PRI is happening on a stock level, as evidenced by a demonstrably increasing trend in biomass. If direct evidence from time-series estimates of stock status is not available, the team may use proxy approaches, including reference to fishing mortality levels and the use of simulation studies.

Generally, if fishing mortality for the entire stock, not just the marginal fishing mortality of the UoA, is less than FMSY, the team can reasonably expect that recovery of the stock is not hindered. This determination will hold true in most cases. However, in some cases, to ensure that rebuilding objectives are likely to be met, the team may need to consider the extent to which total F is below FMSY.

If there is no evidence of recovery as outlined above, by either evaluating stock biomass or total fishing mortality, SA3.6.7.d allows an SG80 score in cases where the proportion of catch by the UoA is effectively not hindering recovery. In other words, if total fishing mortality is not below FMSY, the team needs to evaluate whether the marginal fishing mortality caused by the UoA is material to the stock's ability to recover. The team should determine this in a practical way by examining likely population trajectories if all the other fisheries reduced their catches to zero, in which case the only catches are being taken by the fishery under assessment. Since this will often be difficult to determine, the MSC allows that the team may use the UoA's catch in proportion to the total catch of a stock as a reasonable proxy of whether that UoA, on its own, could be hindering recovery.

The team's judgement on whether the UoA is hindering recovery will depend on the proportion of catch and the overall level of F that is causing the problem. In some cases, the team might find it more useful simply to assess the marginal F by the UoA in terms of the weight of catch removed in relation to the overall abundance of the stock, rather than in relation to the total catch. In this case, the

team may need to investigate whether the UoA has greater impact on certain size classes of the stock, such as juveniles, as the actual impact of the UoA on the population biomass could be different if only mature adults are targeted. In evaluating whether the UoA's stock removals are hindering recovery, the team may also find it useful to evaluate the overall resilience of the species and/or the spatial distribution of the species and evaluate, for example, whether the species is at risk of being locally depleted.

The team should note that:

- · The impact of a UoA should here be assessed in terms of stock removals and the marginal F of the UoA.
- · The percentages listed here should therefore not be confused with the percentages used to designate 'main' species, which are based on the proportion of a species as part of the total catch of the UoA.

In a multi-species fishery context, the target levels of biomass or fishing mortality for some species that would be acceptable at SG100 may be different from those usually applied to a single species. However, in all cases, target levels of biomass or fishing mortality should result in low risk of serious or irreversible harm to in-scope species.

The team should refer to FCP Annex GPB1.5.1.b-c for additional guidance on the harmonisation of scores and conditions when evaluating the cumulative impacts of MSC UoAs.

## GSA3.7 In-scope species management strategy PI (PI 2.1.2)

## Scoring issue (a) MSC UoAs collectively not hindering recovery ▲

To determine whether a strategy is 'demonstrably effective', the team may use:

- · Direct evidence that the proportion of combined catch by all MSC UoAs relative to the total catch of the stock does not hinder recovery, or
- · Simulation studies that combine information on recent and expected F levels, stock size, and recruitment, etc. to confirm that the stock is expected to recover.

Even if the total catch of a species is clearly hindering recovery (e.g. total fishing mortality is not below FMSY), the team may still determine a strategy is demonstrably effective between all MSC UoAs if the proportion of combined catch by the UoAs is effectively not hindering recovery. The team should evaluate whether the fishing mortality caused by the UoAs is material to the stock's ability to recover. For example,

- · Combined catches of all MSC UoAs of less than 30% of the total catch of a species may not be influential in hindering a recovery in a marginal sense and nothing the UoA does would be likely to change the situation.
- · UoA catches of more than 30% might be influential, such that if the UoA took action to reduce its catches, the stock might well start to recover.

If a species below the PRI has an overarching recovery strategy in place, with effort controls set on total fishing mortality that are adhered to, the team may score SG80 if evidence exists that the fishing mortality caused by all MSC UoAs is within the limits set by the recovery strategy in place for the species.

## Recovery strategies differing between UoA jurisdictions

There may be instances where stocks below the PRI have a distribution across multi-jurisdictional boundaries, such as shared, straddling, highly migratory species (HMS), and high seas non-HMS stocks, but there are no comprehensive management efforts in place set to manage and recover most of the stock complex across all boundaries. Instead, separate parts of the stocks may only be governed through regional management measures. Separate UoAs impacting the same stock may thus have to comply with separate strategies for their respective jurisdiction.

In these cases, and other applicable situations, where a demonstrably effective strategy between the MSC UoAs needs to be in place, the different jurisdictional strategies do not have to be aligned and harmonised between UoAs in order to meet this requirement at SG80 The intent is instead to evaluate whether the separate strategies together achieve the outcome that recovery of the species is not hindered by those MSC UoAs. If not, the team should require some alignment of mitigation processes between UoAs.

## Examples: UoAs in different jurisdictions

When separate jurisdictions have set different landing limits on the same depleted species, one UoA would have to comply with a requirement to release all catches alive and another might have an allowance to land only a small amount each year. In such cases, the team would have to:

- · Evaluate the validity of each separate strategy.
- · Calculate the combined mortality caused by each UoA.
- · Determine whether these 2 strategies combined constitute a demonstrably effective strategy to 'not hinder recovery'.

## Scoring issue (b) - Management strategy effectiveness ▲

The team should score scoring issue (b) at the UoA level i.e. collectively for all in-scope scoring elements in the UoA, rather than for each individual scoring element.

## GSA3.7.2

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (c) - Reviewing measures for reducing unwanted catch ▲

## Example 1

In a North Sea groundfish UoA, a percentage of the catch includes gurnard, all of which are thrown back dead. In this case, the gurnard would be unwanted. The team should score this scoring issue for this catch.

However, if all or almost all of the gurnards were to be kept for crew consumption or, for example, landed and sold, the catch would no longer be considered unwanted. In this case, the team should not score scoring issue (c).

## Example 2

In a longline UoA where a percentage of the catch includes a skate species, the skate species is immediately cut from the line rather than being landed. In this case, the team should consider the skate to be unwanted catch. The team's review of 'alternative measures' should reflect the need to minimise the mortality of the species, with the expectation that released skate will have high survivability or avoid capture in the first place.

## Example 3

In a mixed-species UoA, all species are landed and consumed or sold, so there is no unwanted catch. In this case, the team should not score scoring issue (c).

## Example: review of 'alternative measures'

The management body for a fishery has investigated several measures that could be used to minimise the catch of species A, a species that is discarded with poor survivability.

The management body selected 4 potential measures that have been used in similar gear in other fisheries or to minimise mortality of this species. The management body does not have quantitative estimates of the levels by which the potential measures might reduce the catch of species A through their own field testing, but they have considered other studies indicating that implementing 3 of these measures would have no or little effect on reducing the catch of this species.

However, the 4th measure is estimated to reduce catch of this species by 80%. The measure:

- · Is not expensive to implement.

- · Will not require replacing of current gear.
- · Will not affect crew safety or significantly add time to vessel operations.
- · Slightly reduces the catch of the target species, but not significantly.
- · Does not cause increased catches of other P2 'unwanted' or ETP/OOS species.
- · Does not have a negative impact on habitat.

The management body recommends use of measure 4 but has not yet required it in legislation, nor has the fishery chosen to adopt it. This fishery has clearly reviewed 'alternative measures' but has not yet implemented them.

This fishery would meet SG60 if it:

- · Has clearly reviewed 'alternative measures' but has not yet implemented them.
- · Were to adopt the use of this measure and it was being used at the time of the site visit.
- · Has no plans to conduct another review of measures.

This fishery would meet SG80 if:

- · It were to adopt the use of this measure.
- · The measure was being used at the time of the site visit.
- · Another review was scheduled to take place in 3 years' time.

This fishery would meet SG100 if:

- · It were to adopt the use of this measure.
- · The measure was being used at the time of the site visit.
- · It planned to review 'alternative measures' every 2 years.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.7.2.1 'Alternative measures' ▲

The team should consider:

- · How the 'alternative measures' for review have been selected.
- · Whether appropriate gear and practices have been considered as part of the review.

The review may consider 'best practice' measures in a gear/species/region that have been established as achieving the lowest achievable levels, and therefore meet the FAO's description of 'proper selective and environmentally safe fishing gear' (see Box GSA7).

If 'best practice' has not been established, or it is not clear which measures reduce catch to the lowest achievable levels, the team should assess whether the review considers measures that are expected or known to minimise mortality of the unwanted species.

The gear and practices selected for review may be from a number of sources, including those that have been shown to be effective in similar fisheries or regions, or those presented as 'best practice' in international fora.

The list below highlights some repositories of expertise for mitigation methods but is not an exhaustive list. International fora with information and/or expertise on reducing unwanted catches include:

- · Bycatch Reduction Techniques Database, Consortium for Wildlife Bycatch Reduction 38 .

- · Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) 39 .
- · Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) 40 .
- · Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC-Sea Turtles) 41 .
- · International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 42 .
- · UNEP-CMS (United Nations Environment Programme - Convention on Migratory Species) 43 .

In addition, many national bodies and RFMOs have developed policies and procedures to reduce unwanted catch, for example:

- · The US NOAA Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program (BREP).
- · Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).
- · The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, which also maintains a bycatch mitigation information system 44  for that region.

Where the P2 components are required to be harmonised with other MSC certified fisheries, the team should consider whether the UoA under assessment has considered the gear and practices used in these fisheries as part of their list of 'alternative measures', if they have been shown to minimise unwanted catch.

In situations where the proposed alternative mitigation measures are cost prohibitive or impractical for the fishery to implement, other lower cost 'alternative measures' may be considered, for example, improved education for fisheries regarding 'best practice' approaches. This is not meant to be a means to avoid the costs associated with implementation of gear modifications or other measures but is an alternative to achieve minimisation when other measures would render the fishery economically unviable.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.7.2.2 Review of 'alternative measures' ▲

Some fishery clients may need to review 'alternative measures' more frequently, depending on the extent and nature of the unwanted catch; for example, as a result of changes in stock size. The team may determine that a review should occur more frequently if information becomes available indicating that the existing measures are ineffective and do not lead to any reductions in mortalities of unwanted species; for example, as determined during a surveillance audit.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.7.2.3 Implemented as appropriate ▲

At SG80, the 'alternative measures' may be implemented either within the UoA or in the wider fishery as part of a sub-strategy or code of conduct, etc. on unwanted catch. This could be species-specific or cover all unwanted catch.

Evidence of implementation may include:

- · The development and use of codes of conduct.

- · A description of appropriate ways of handling gear and catch on board vessels and in crew training records.
- · Evidence from the fleet or observers that measures are being implemented by fishers.
- · A summary document listing information and measures reviewed along with an analysis of the measures and their appropriateness for the UoA.
- · The minutes of a meeting that has considered 'alternative measures'.

If the measures reviewed are shown to be more effective at minimising unwanted catch, but the measures are not implemented, the team should review the reasons for this, which can be:

- · Evidence that the practicality would be adversely affected by implementing the measures reviewed. Examples of such practicalities include crew safety, target catch, and vessel operations.
- · Evidence that the UoA has assessed the economic costs and benefits of implementing the measure and determined that the potential costs would have an adverse impact on the economic viability of the fishery.
- · Evidence that the UoA has considered the implications of relevant solutions on other species and habitats and found that there are negative consequences for:
- o Species, causing them to fall below the PRI or outside biologically based limits, or hindering their recovery from such a state.
- o Habitats, causing serious or irreversible harm to the habitat, such that the measures should not be implemented.

The FAO (2011) 45  recognises that there are costs and benefits to implementing measures that include direct and indirect costs, such as:

- · Cost of the gear.
- · Impact on revenue from catch volumes or quality.
- · Operational efficiency.
- · Access or restriction to fishing opportunities.

Costs can be mitigated through the application of grants/loans and preferential treatment on duties and taxes for investment in new technologies. The team's judgement of whether costs are prohibitive should take these issues into account together with the size and scale of a fishery.

## Example: prohibitive costs ▲

The management body of a small-scale UoA in a developing country reviews potential mitigation measures on a regular basis. One reviewed measure has been shown to reduce mortality of unwanted catch in similar fisheries but does not affect target catch efficiency or crew safety. However, the UoA vessels decide not to implement the measure because they determine that there would be a 10% increase in costs arising from greater length of time for setting gear. This cost increase would significantly impact their economic viability, even when offset by potential benefits.

In this case, the team would review evidence that the costs would be projected to increase by 10%, based on projected cost of purchasing measure and loss/gain in target species catches/quality, and

45 FAO (2011) International Guidelines on Bycatch Management and Reduction of Discards. Rome/Roma, FAO. 2011. 73 pp.

that this increase would have a significant impact on the economic viability of the UoA; for example, based on comparison to profit and loss, or turnover.

The UoA could still meet SG80 for this scoring issue (c) if the team concludes that:

- · Implementing this measure would be cost prohibitive for the UoA.
- · The measure review was not implemented on this basis.

The UoA could meet SG80 or higher if:

- · The cost of implementation in this UoA was partially covered by a donation for the purpose from a funding body and a non-governmental organisation (NGO), so that the increased cost to the UoA was not prohibitive.
- · All other criteria have been met.

The MSC has purposely not been prescriptive about determining what is cost effective or safe, recognising that what could be unsafe or economically unviable in one fishery might be safe and economically viable in another. The team will need to use its expert judgement to assess this. GSA3.7.2.3 indicates that there should be evidence that the fishery assessed the costs and benefits of 'alternative measures'. It does not stipulate whether this needs to be a fully quantitative cost/benefit analysis or whether a qualitative indication considering costs of implementing measures versus fishery profits would be enough. The MSC does not want to unduly burden the fishery clients, so size and scale of the fishery could be a factor in determining the extent to which they assess costs and benefits of 'alternative measures'. Thus, an industrial fishery with large profit margins indicating they did not implement a measure because it was too expensive would need to provide a more detailed indication that the costs would impact their viability than would a smallscale fishery with slim profit margins, which might be able to simply indicate the cost of any measures compared with profit. In both cases there should be some evidence that the fishery or management body investigated the costs of implementing the gear; for example, by contacting a supplier for a quote or referring to a catalogue.

To determine the point at which a measure becomes cost prohibitive, the team should consider:

- · The point at which the potential costs would adversely impact the economic viability of the fishery (this may constitute the point at which the measure becomes cost prohibitive).
- · That size and scale of the fishery.
- · Opportunities to mitigate costs (e.g. through grants/funding).

## GSA3.7.7-8 Ghost gear management strategy scoring issue ▲

The team should use the following definitions (adapted from FAO Voluntary Guidelines on the Marking of Fishing Gear 46 ) when considering ghost gear and its impacts:

- · Ghost gear: fishing gear or parts thereof (including fish aggregating devices) that are abandoned, lost, or discarded at sea. This is more formally referred to as 'Abandoned, Lost, or Discarded Fishing Gear' (ALDFG).
- · Ghost gear impact : environmental impacts resulting from ghost gear, including ghost fishing and/or its physical impact on habitats.
- · Fishing gear: a tool with which living aquatic resources are captured. This refers to any physical device, or part thereof, or combination of items, that may be placed on or in the water or on the seabed, with the intended purpose of capturing or facilitating the capture, or harvesting of marine organisms, in accordance with MARPOL Annex V 47;48 .
- · Ghost fishing : the capture and/or entanglement of target, non-target, and ETP/OOS species by ghost gear.
- · Ghost fishing mortality : the mortality of organisms arising from the entrapment, entanglement, or other physical interactions with ghost gear.
- · Abandoned fishing gear: fishing gear over which that operator/owner has control and that could be retrieved by the owner/operator but that is deliberately left at sea due to force majeure or other unforeseen reasons.
- · Discarded fishing gear : fishing gear that is deliberately released at sea without any attempt for further control or recovery by the owner/operator.
- · Lost fishing gear: fishing gear over which the owner/operator has accidentally lost control and that cannot be located and/or retrieved by the owner/operator.
- · Fish aggregating device (FAD): a permanent, semi permanent or temporary object, structure, or -device of any material, man made or natural, that is deployed, and/or tracked, and used to -aggregate fish for subsequent capture. A FAD can be either an anchored FAD (aFAD) or a drifting FAD (dFAD). In MSC assessments, FADs are not considered a gear type as such because they do not capture fish, but merely facilitate subsequent capture. FADs therefore may be included as a functional part of certain fishing gear types (e.g. purse seine, handline) as they are sometimes used to facilitate the capture efficiency of these gears.

Whilst it is recognised that it is challenging to completely eliminate some ghost gear (e.g. gear loss from severe storms), it is the MSC's intent that fishery clients aim to minimise ghost gear and its impact on marine ecosystems as much as possible by having effective management strategies that aim to avoid gear loss or mitigate ghost gear impacts.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.7.6 Demonstrably absent ▲

The team should use its expert judgement to determine whether the risk of ghost gear impact is demonstrably absent. Examples could include:

- · Situations characterised by an absence of fishing gear or where there is no risk of gear loss in routine operation. For example, hand-raked, hand-dived or hand-dredged fisheries.
- · Situations where there are no scoring elements at risk of interacting with the type of ghost gear under consideration.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.7.8 Assessing ghost gear management measures ▲

At the SG60 level, measures may not in isolation significantly reduce ghost gear, however the team should consider SG60 as met if there are measures in place that over time could contribute to a partial strategy or strategy that would be expected to 'minimise' ghost gear impacts.

Various approaches can be taken to manage ghost gear and its impacts. It is widely accepted that prevention is better than mitigation or remediation of ghost gear impacts.

As proposed by McFadyen et al. (2009) 49 , interventions can be broadly divided between measures that:

- · Prevent (by avoiding the occurrence of ghost gear in the environment).
- · Mitigate (by reducing the impact of ghost gear in the environment).
- · Remediate (by removing ghost gear from the environment).

These interventions include but are not limited to those listed in Table GSA4.

An example of a preventative measure is a system in place for gear marking. Gear marking can prevent gear loss in several ways. In fisheries that use passive gear, marking can improve visibility to avoid accidental gear conflict and entanglement of gear in propeller shafts, a major cause of gear loss. Alternatively, where gear marking allows for identification of ownership of lost gear, it can disincentivise abandonment and encourage innovation to prevent gear loss. This becomes even more effective when combined with additional incentives for avoiding or remedying gear loss, or when combined with enforcement action or penalties.

Table GSA4 Examples of ghost gear management measures

| Type of measure   | Example of measures                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prevention        | • A system for gear marking is in place that reduces gear conflict or allows  identification of ownership to facilitate gear loss monitoring. |
|                   | • Spatial and/or temporal measures to reduce gear conflict.                                                                                   |
|                   | • Fishing input controls to limit gear use (e.g. limits on soak time for passive  gear types).                                                |
|                   | • Gear design to reduce whole or partial loss of the fishing gear (including  technology to track gear position).                             |
|                   | • Vessel design to reduce discarding of gear and other aquatic litter.                                                                        |
|                   | • Use of end-of-life fishing gear disposal facilities.                                                                                        |
|                   | • Evidenced fisher education programmes raising awareness on preventing  gear loss.                                                           |
| Mitigation        | • Gear design to reduce the incidence and duration of ghost fishing where  gear is lost.                                                      |
| Remediation       | • Lost gear reporting, locating, and recovery initiatives.                                                                                    |

Note that this list is not exhaustive.

## GSA3.8

In-scope species information PI (PI 2.1.3)

## GSA3.8.3 Information adequacy for management strategy ▲

The team should use information that is adequate to support understanding of the effectiveness and practicality of measures used by the UoA and potential 'alternative measures', if:

- · There is unwanted catch, and
- · Scoring issue (c) on the 'review' of 'alternative measures' is scored in the management PI 2.1.2.

## GSA3.9 ETP/OOS species outcome PI (PI 2.2.1)

## Scoring issue (a) - assessment of direct UoA effects on ETP/OOS unit(s) ▲

The MSC's intent is that the UoA does not hinder the recovery of the ETP/OOS unit to a level consistent with achieving favourable conservation status. In the MSC context, direct effects of the UoA on the ETP/OOS unit covers injuries and mortalities due to interaction with the fishing gear or vessels, including unobserved or cryptic mortality that may result from ghost fishing. Direct effects may also include sub-lethal effects, such as injuries that do not immediately result in death and loss of fitness due to disturbance. The indirect effects of the UoA on the ETP/OOS unit are those that result from fishery impacting the ecosystem in a way that consequently effects the ETP/OOS unit. These indirect effects are assessed as part of the Ecosystem Outcome PI 2.4.1.

If an ETP unit is already at a level consistent with favourable conservation status, this may be used as evidence that the UoA does not hinder recovery of the ETP unit to this level. However, the team should consider whether there are other factors that would mean that the UoA may be hindering recovery; for example, if the impact assessment evaluating status relative to favourable conservation status was undertaken more than 5 years ago, or the ETP/OOS unit has shown steady declines likely attributable to UoA mortalities.

## GSA3.9.1 Defining ETP/OOS unit ▲

The identification of the appropriate ETP/OOS unit(s) is essential for assessing the impact of the UoA (or MSC UoAs) on ETP and OOS species. The MSC recognises that there are a variety of ways that this has been approached across taxa and in different management contexts.

The MSC's intent is that the team indicates which ETP/OOS unit(s) has been selected, and that the ETP/OOS unit(s) is appropriate to the species and the context of the fishery in assessment. The selection should also be precautionary. The ETP/OOS unit(s) may be a species, a population, a stock, or another category.

Organisations responsible for assessing the status of species may have already identified an ETP/OOS unit based on:

- · Biological attributes.
- · Impacts of the UoA on that unit, in terms of scale and intensity.
- · Geopolitical boundaries.

In such cases, these units would normally be used by the team. However, if the organisation responsible for assessing status has not selected the most appropriate and precautionary unit based on the criteria above, the team will need to select a different ETP/OOS unit.

Organisations responsible for assessing the status of species may include relevant management authorities associated with the UoA but also international organisations, such as the International Whaling Commission (IWC), and Instruments associated with the Convention on Migratory Species; for example, ASCOBANS and ACAP.

The team will need to determine the appropriate ETP/OOS unit(s) and provide a justification for this choice, if:

- · An ETP/OOS unit(s) has not already been identified by the organisations responsible for assessing status of species, or
- · A unit appropriate for assessing impact of the UoA has not been identified by the organisations responsible, or
- · The organisations responsible differ in how they identify a unit.

The selection of the unit(s) may be a compromise between using the ETP/OOS unit(s) that best reflects the subset of individuals that are impacted by the UoA, whilst also ensuring that mortalities can still be attributed to the ETP/OOS unit(s) in question. However, the team should also be precautionary when determining the unit(s).

For example, where multiple populations of the same species overlap so that it is not possible to determine from which population an individual mortality came from, the team should select a higher taxonomic level (e.g. species) as the ETP/OOS unit(s), provided the individual populations are likely to have the same status. However, in the situation described above, if the individual populations have different status, the team should be more precautionary and select the more vulnerable population as the ETP/OOS unit(s). Where there is evidence that the fishery overlaps geographically with only (or mainly) one population, the team should consider the impact of fishing mortalities on that population as the ETP/OOS unit(s).

The team should note that uncertainty in population structure (i.e. whether the fishery is impacting single or multiple units) can make defining an ETP/OOS unit(s) particularly challenging. Ideally, the degree of connectivity and self-recruitment will determine the most appropriate ETP/OOS unit(s). For example, where a single population is completely isolated and there is no or little connectivity or geographic overlap with other populations, this single population is likely to be the most appropriate ETP/OOS unit. However, where there is high level of connectivity between metapopulations, the wider metapopulation is likely to be the most appropriate ETP/OOS unit. Where little is known about connectivity, approaches that consider the ability to identify impacts and implement management measures may be more appropriate. In this case, selecting the ETP/OOS unit at the smallest scale that is practical makes it harder to falsely conclude that the population is at a higher level than it really is.

To help illustrate the intent of these requirements, examples of how identifying ETP/OOS units of assessment in different contexts are provided below.

## Example 1: Cetacean species in the UK

The UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) defines cetacean populations as 'a collection of individuals all of the same species with a tendency to be found in the same area. Populations contain genetic variation within the population itself, and between other populations. Populations can exist in isolation, or can co-exist at least during a part of the year with other conspecific populations (i.e. other populations of the same species) in the same area'. The JNCC notes that most cetaceans in UK waters are part of larger biological populations, with ranges extending into waters of other countries or the High Seas. However, to obtain the best conservation outcomes for species, it divides the populations into smaller management units, which provide an indication of the spatial scales at which impact assessments, cumulatively or in combination, need to be assessed for key cetacean species in UK waters. The management units are based on best understanding of biological population structure and any ecological differentiation between populations, but the boundaries are determined either by political boundaries (e.g. UK vs Irish waters) or the management of human activities (e.g. ICES divisions for fisheries management) 53 . For example, for bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ) the JNCC identifies seven management units in the UK, some of which fall into UK waters and others are shared with other countries, e.g. Greater North Sea 54 . These seven management units could be considered ETP/OOS units for the purposes of fishery assessments. Where a fishery overlaps with multiple ETP/OOS units, each would be considered a separate scoring element.

## Example 2: Global marine turtles

For marine turtles, regional management units (RMUs) were developed through the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group to evaluate the relative impacts of fisheries on appropriate population units for widely distributed species 55;56 . RMUs are biologically and geographically explicit population segments. They use spatially integrated information, including information on individual nesting sites, genetic stocks, and geographic distributions of different life-history stages to account for complexities in marine turtle population structures. 57  RMUs are equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, so they are used as the appropriate demographic unit for IUCN Red List assessments. The use of spatial information allows overlap of individual RMUs with specific fisheries to be evaluated. The RMU would also be the most relevant ETP/OOS unit for most fishery assessments. However, there are some areas (e.g. Australia) where genetic sub-structuring exists, and specific genetically defined management units have been identified. For UoAs in those areas, these management units may be the more relevant ETP/OOS unit.

The oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) is distributed globally in tropical and subtemperate waters. Oceanic whitetips were evaluated as Critically Endangered as a species on the

IUCN Red List in the 2018 assessment 58 . The IUCN assessment indicates that there are no data available on the global population size of the oceanic whitetip shark, but that preliminary results from genetic studies suggest there may be some differences between individuals in the Western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific 59 .

The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) undertook a stock assessment for the oceanic whitetip shark stock in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) in 2019 2019 60 . This stock assessment indicated that there is no evidence for more than one population within the WCPO but that there is limited horizontal movement inferred from satellite tagging, suggesting that there is a potential for regional residency in the Pacific Ocean. Defining the stock at this scale also allows for the WCPFC, as the relevant management body, to assess the impact of fisheries in the region on this stock and to apply management measures. Given that the stock is based on some biological information and is managed at stock level by the relevant management body, the WCPO stock of oceanic whitetip is a relevant ETP/OOS unit.

## Example 4: Black-browed albatross populations in the South Atlantic

There are several possible taxonomic units below species that CABs could consider in this case for example, seabirds can be grouped by 'colony', 'sub-colony' or 'breeding site', 'island group', 'population' or, in the case of coastal breeding birds, by administrative unit such as county or country. Considering different political responsibilities, legislation, threats, population trends and dynamics, at-sea distributions, and migration patterns, 'island group' may be the most relevant ETP/OOS unit, where practical, or country for continental land masses. For example, the Agreement on Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) assigns priorities for research and monitoring at the island group level, and this is also the level at which ACAP identifies Priority Populations (as flagships); i.e. those populations declining at more than 3% per year, hold more than 10% of global breeding numbers, and are at risk from fisheries requiring international action to improve their conservation.

An example supporting selection of island group as the ETP/OOS unit is the case of black-browed albatross ( Thalassarche melanophris ) in the South Atlantic. The 2018 IUCN status assessment of black-browed albatross determined that as a species they are Least Concern 61 . There are no subpopulation assessments for this species group at this time in IUCN. However, black-browed albatross from different island groups would likely qualify as IUCN sub-populations, i.e. they can be defined as geographically or otherwise distinct groups in the population between which there is little demographic or genetic exchange. Black-browed albatrosses in the Falkland Islands are genetically distinct from those elsewhere, and the status trend is increasing, whereas on South Georgia the population is declining 62 . The South Georgia population cannot be genetically distinguished from birds breeding on islands in Chile; however, in most seabird species, including albatrosses, banding studies indicate that individuals show very high micro-philopatry, often

recruiting into the same sub-colony or, in species where nests are loosely aggregated, into the same sub-area from which they fledged 63 . Most of the remainder recruit onto the same island or stretch of coast ('colony'), relatively few into adjacent colonies and very small numbers (or none) into colonies in other island groups.

Given that there is also an understanding of at-sea distribution for the populations from different island groups, and generally good separation between individuals from island groups at sea, the island group (e.g. South Georgia, Falkland Islands) level would be the most relevant ETP/OOS unit for fisheries interacting with this species.

## Example 5: Minke whale populations in North Pacific

The situation with common minke whales ( Balaenoptera acutorostrata ) in the North Pacific around Japan is a good example of when the team may need to be more precautionary when selecting an ETP/OOS unit. The IUCN status of common minke whales is Least Concern 64 . There is uncertainty about the exact population structure of minke whales in the North Pacific, but the International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognises at least two populations of minke whales in this region: the 'O' type are relatively abundant whereas the 'J' type have been heavily depleted 65 . The two populations have different overall distributions but mix in some areas where they are subject to bycatch and directed takes. Where the UoA overlaps with the area in which the species mix in distribution or the distribution is uncertain, the choice of ETP/OOS unit should be precautionary. This is because it is not always possible to distinguish the population from which the individual mortalities came from. Thus, unless there is evidence to the contrary from the UoA, the 'J' type minke whales would be the most relevant ETP/OOS unit.

Where the UoA overlaps with the area where reliable spatial information indicates that only the 'O' type of whale is distributed, it would be more appropriate to select only the 'O' type as the ETP/OOS unit.

## GSA3.9.2 Determining the likelihood of hindering recovery to favourable conservation status ▲

The favourable conservation status reference point is set as a minimum of 50% of carrying capacity but may be higher depending on the life-history characteristics of the species. Different terms may be used to characterise the TRPs consistent with the MSC definition of favourable conservation status including optimum sustainable population (OSP), maximum net productivity level (MNPL) and maximum sustained fishing mortality (MSM). Fishing mortality or biomass-based reference points, such as MSY, may be used if they are set to ensure recovery to at least 50% of carrying capacity.

Where ETP/OOS units are not 'likely' to be at favourable conservation status, the UoA needs to demonstrate that any mortalities from the ETP/OOS unit are 'unlikely' to hinder recovery. That is, the level of mortalities is low enough that they would not prevent recovery to favourable conservation status, if the species is capable of recovering to this level, within 100 years or 3 generations, whichever is shorter.

It is not the MSC's intent that the team undertake an assessment of the status of the ETP/OOS unit or estimate the impact of fishing mortalities. It is for the UoA(s), or organisations responsible for assessing status of species, to undertake these analyses and provide them to the team to consider. When applying the MSC scoring guidepost probability levels, the team should then assess this

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

information, including considering the quality and recency of the assessment and the UoA-specific information used.

## Example: Assessment of 2.2.1a where potential biological removal is used to evaluate UoA impact

For marine mammals, the US defines populations in relation to Optimum Sustainable Population. Populations that are not at Optimum Sustainable Population are those below their MNPL, or below 50-70% of a historical population size representing carrying capacity 66 . To evaluate this, mortality limits for marine mammals are represented using potential biological removal (PBR), which is linked mathematically to the MNPL, specifically to achieve the conservation objective that 95% of simulated populations met two criteria:

- · That populations starting at MNPL stayed there or above for 20 years.
- · That populations starting at 30% of carrying capacity recovered to at least MNPL over 100 years 67 .

Thus, PBR as applied in this case is an appropriate method to determine whether the UoA hinders recovery to favourable conservation status.

In this example, a management agency calculated a PBR of 100 individuals for dolphin A in 2020. To assess SG60, the team would evaluate the likelihood that the UoA-related mortality presented for dolphin A was below this level. The PBR uses a precautionary value for a recovery factor and the assessment was undertaken recently, so the probability that the PBR is consistent with achieving the population objective has a high degree of certainty. However, the team also needs to consider the quality of the UoA-related mortality information. If the average estimate of UoA mortalities of dolphin A is 90 individuals (i.e. close to the PBR limit) over the period 2015-2020, but this estimate is based on very limited fishery-independent information that was then scaled to the UoA level, the team may decide that it is only 'likely' (SG60) that the UoA is not hindering recovery. However, if higher-quality estimates of UoA mortalities were provided, despite the number of mortalities being close to the PBR limit, the team may decide that a score of 80 is appropriate.

## Methods for assessing status of the ETP/OOS unit or impact of the UoA

Several methods are available to estimate the status of the ETP/OOS unit, or whether the impact of the UoA(s) would hinder recovery to favourable conservation status. Possible methods include stock assessments or population viability analyses. Examples of other commonly used methods are presented in Table GSA5. The MSC does not advocate the use of one method over another, because each may have pros and cons in a given situation. With all of these methods, the team should consider the appropriateness of the assessment for estimating whether the fishery hinders recovery of the ETP/OOS unit to a level consistent with favourable conservation status, as well as the uncertainty associated with the outcomes.

## Note on the use of IUCN Red List and Favourable Conservation Status

The IUCN Red List provides threat statuses for species or populations. The team should not use these threat statuses as an automatic evaluation of whether an ETP/OOS unit is currently at a level consistent with favourable conservation status. The IUCN Red List was developed to identify risk of extinction, so it is possible that an ETP/OOS unit listed as Least Concern may not be at favourable conservation status but has not yet depleted to a level or at a rate that would trigger a higher threat categorisation on the IUCN Red List. In addition, the IUCN Red List may not provide a threat evaluation at the same level as the ETP/OOS unit; for example, if it provides a threat status for a species but not the specific population impacted by the UoA.

The IUCN Red List assessment may provide useful information on the current population size and trends for species, where these have been updated regularly, as well as links to relevant risk assessments. However, the intent of the MSC requirements is that there is a specific quantitative analysis on the status of the ETP unit with respect to favourable conservation status or the potential for any mortalities from the UoA(s) to hinder recovery to this level.

## GSA3.9.3 Intentional harassment or intentional killing of marine mammals ▲

The targeted exploitation of marine mammals is not within scope of the MSC Fisheries Standard. However, its understood that some fisheries intentionally kill or harass marine mammals whilst

targeting species in the scope of the MSC Fisheries Standard. The intent of SA3.9.3 is to ensure that for any UoAs in which intentional harassment or intentional killing of marine mammals is an integral part of the fishing operation (activity or practice), such activity has not hindered recovery to favourable conservation status.

The MSC recognises that there are challenges in clearly demonstrating that a UoA has not hindered recovery when considering all potential sources of impact associated with intentional harassment or intentional killing of marine mammals (including observed mortality, unobserved/cryptic mortality, sublethal population-level impacts, or any other impact that may affect population status).

Consequently, this requirement focuses on evaluating outcome status in a more precautionary manner by requiring a high degree of certainty that recovery is not necessary or has already occurred.

The team should interpret 'high degree of certainty' as a probability level that is equal to or greater than the 95th percentile, consistent with the SG100 level in Table SA8.

## GSA3.9.3.2-3.9.3.4 ▲

An example of the intentional harassment or intentional killing of marine mammals as an integral part of the fishing operation is the intentional pursuit and encirclement of marine mammals with fishing gear (e.g. purse seine nets) or vessels.

The team should not consider the following examples of intentional harassment or intentional killing of marine mammals as being an integral part of the fishing operation:

- · The use of non-lethal deterrent devices or actions aimed at deterring marine mammals from damaging catch or gear, or otherwise deployed to reduce entanglement risk, except where:
- o It is demonstrated that their continued deployment/use causes serious injury or directly compromises marine mammal survival.
- o Firearms are used to deter or kill marine mammals. These are lethal devices and if used as an integral part of the UoA fishing operation, should trigger the application of SA3.9.3.
- · The unwanted catch of marine mammals, as this outcome is normally considered to be unintentional.

## Example: Application of SA3.9.3 for 2.2.1 scoring issue (a)

Fishery A is a purse seine fishery that targets a species of tuna. The fishery comprises 18 vessels, with 2 UoAs. UoA1 targets free school (unassociated) sets, and UoA2 targets FAD sets. The fishery interacts with 10 ETP/OOS units, 2 of which are marine mammals (a species of baleen whale and a species of dolphin).

The team considered whether there is evidence that the fisheries interactions with the 2 marine mammal ETP/OOS units involved the intentional harassment or intentional killing of that unit as an integral part of the fishing operation, as per the definitions set out in SA3.9.3.2-SA3.9.3.4.

The team found that the dolphin interactions were incidental bycatch recorded in unassociated sets. Therefore, the team did not trigger the application of SA3.9.3 to score the direct effects of the dolphin ETP/OOS unit.

The baleen whale interactions had occurred where the fishery had set on (encircled) the whale. Available observer data highlighted that these whale sets were an intended part of the fishery's operations, comprising 3% of sets in UoA2. This part of the fishery operation was determined to be a form of intentional harassment and determined to be an integral part of the fishing operation. As such, the team triggered the application of SA3.9.3 for UoA2 to score the impacted baleen whale ETP/OOS unit at the SG80 level.

The team assessed the available information about the proportion of whales released alive, the scale and intensity of the fishery and findings from several studies on the post-capture survival rates of the species. In combination with studies on the status of the species, the team used this information to determine that UoA2 is unlikely to hinder recovery of the ETP/OOS unit to favourable conservation status. The fishery therefore met SG60 for scoring issue a. However, there was insufficient information available to enable the team to determine the population status of the

baleen whale ETP/OOS unit was at a level consistent with favourable conservation status with a high degree of certainty as required by SA3.9.3 to meet SG80 for this unit. Therefore, for UoA2, the baleen whale ETP/OOS unit did not meet SG80 for scoring issue a.

The team assessed the other 9 ETP/OOS units that did not trigger SA3.9.3. These all met SG60 and met or exceeded SG80 for the direct effects scoring issue (PI 2.2.1 (a)). In the scoring rationale, the team included explanations for each unit.

The team applied the scoring element approach set out in FCP v3.1 7.15. As only one of 10 scoring elements failed to achieve SG80, the score for 2.2.1 (a) was 75.

The team set a condition against PI 2.2.1 for the fishery to verify the status of the ETP/OOS unit using a quantitative estimate of the population size. Within the Client Action Plan, the client set out that they will contract a university to undertake a study of the population of the baleen whale ETP/OOS unit with results to be made publicly available.

## GSA3.10 ETP/OOS unit management strategy PI (PI 2.2.2) ▲

The MSC's intent for this PI is that management measures or strategies are implemented that deliver the ETP/OOS outcome SG80 level and minimise mortalities of the ETP/OOS unit.

Management measures or strategies should be designed to achieve both of these objectives and should have been implemented 'on the water'.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - Management strategy ▲

## Measures expected to minimise mortality

Measures that are expected to minimise mortality are defined in this requirement. The assessment team should consider:

- · How the measures have been selected.
- · Whether they represent 'best practice' when it comes to minimising mortality or have been shown to be effective at minimising mortality in the UoA or similar fisheries, i.e. to the extent practicable.

Where 'best practice' has been established as achieving the lowest UoA mortality possible whilst not negatively affecting the mortality of other non-target species or unduly affecting targeting catch rates (a small decrease in target catch may be expected, e.g. 10%), the expectation is that these measures are implemented in the fishery in order to meet at least the SG60 level.

## Where 'best practice' is established

'Best practice' may already be established by national management agencies or in international fora. The MSC's intent is that where 'best practice' measures exist and at least one 'best practice' measure is implemented in the fishery, the measures expected to minimise mortality part of PI 2.2.2 scoring issue (a) would be met at the SG60 level. To achieve SG80 or higher for this part of PI 2.2.2 scoring issue (a), two or more 'best practice' measures should be applied (unless only one 'best practice' measure exists). In this context it is also the MSC's intent that any relevant legally mandated best-practice measures for the UoA should be complied with. This compliance aspect is considered in PI 3.2.3 scoring issue (d) as per SA4.9.4.

The FAO produces Best Practice Technical Guidelines for bycatch of birds, turtles, and mammals, although these are not updated regularly 81 . Also, the ACAP reviews and identifies 'best practice' mitigation measures for seabird bycatch in a number of gear types. In order to be considered 'best practice', a number of criteria are required to be met including:

- · Individual fishing technologies and techniques should be selected from those shown by experimental research to significantly reduce the rate of seabird incidental mortality to the lowest achievable levels.
- · Fishing technologies and techniques, or a combination thereof, should have clear and proven specifications and minimum performance standards for their deployment and use.
- · Fishing technologies and techniques should be demonstrated to be practical, cost effective and widely available.
- · Fishing technologies and techniques should, to the extent practicable, maintain catch rates of target species.
- · Fishing technologies and techniques should, to the extent practicable, not increase the bycatch of other taxa.
- · Minimum performance standards and methods of ensuring compliance should be provided for fishing technologies and techniques and should be clearly specified in fishery regulations 82 .

## Where 'best practice' is not clearly established

For some species/gear interactions, there are no established 'best practice' measures. In these cases, the measures applied in the fishery should be selected from those that are shown to reduce mortality rates to the lowest practicable levels in the UoA or similar fisheries.

For example, when pingers are used correctly (i.e. applied across the entire UoA and adequately monitored for placement and functioning), they may be considered to minimise harbour porpoise bycatch in gillnets. However, pingers could not be considered to minimise common dolphin bycatch in gillnets because there is no clear evidence for their consistent effectiveness. For common dolphins, the UoA would need to have implemented other measures that are expected minimise mortality, e.g. based on measures that have been shown to be successful elsewhere or through development of new measures tested in the UoA itself in order to meet the SG60 requirement.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - management strategy effectiveness ▲

The MSC's intent is that the UoA needs to provide evidence that it is progressing towards achieving the objectives of minimising mortality of the ETP/OOS unit. There are four possible ways of demonstrating this:

- 1. There is evidence that the UoA has zero mortalities (including unobserved) of the ETP/OOS unit.
- 2. There is evidence of reductions in the mortality of the ETP/OOS unit over time.
- 3. The UoA may not have evidence of reduction but it:
- a. Is 'highly unlikely' to be hindering recovery of the ETP/OOS unit to favourable conservation status (demonstrated through meeting SG80 in PI 2.2.1 (a) or scoring 80 or above when the PSA is applied.

- b. Has a 'comprehensive strategy' and has applied all existing 'best practice' measures expected to minimise mortality (demonstrated through meeting SG100 in PI 2.2.2 (a).

Where none of these four criteria apply, the MSC's intent is that the UoA does not meet SG80 for this scoring issue.

A specific magnitude of reduction is not specified, however, the MSC's intent is that real, on-the-water progress towards reducing the mortality rate needs to be demonstrated by the UoA in order to meet SG80. Overall declining trends in ETP/OOS unit mortalities over a five-year period, for example, could be taken as evidence of demonstrable reductions, even if there may be some stochasticity in ETP/OOS unit mortalities over this time. However, the team should also consider the reasons for any reductions, including whether the reductions may be due to a decline in the abundance of the ETP/OOS unit rather than the implementation of management measures to minimise mortality. The MSC's intent is that if the reductions are likely to be caused by declines in abundance rather than the measures implemented by the fishery, this would not be considered evidence of reductions and SG80 would not be met.

## Example

Reductions in UoA-related mortality are demonstrated in longline fishery 1, which interacts with 3 seabird units: A, B, and C. Bird-scaring (tori) lines and offal-discharge practices were introduced as 'best practice' mitigation measures in the year 2000. In 2005, the bycatch rate for all 3 seabirds had reduced from 0.2 birds/1,000 hooks to &lt; 0.05 birds/1,000 hooks. The population sizes for seabird units A, B, and C had remained relatively stable during this period and the number of birds following the vessels remained consistent. However, the number of mortalities had demonstrably declined. Fishery 1 would meet at least SG80 for PI 2.2.2 scoring issue (b).

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (c) - 'Review' of 'alternative measures' ▲

Where there are mortalities of ETP/OOS scoring elements, a review of 'alternative measures' by the UoA or related management agency is required. The MSC's intent is that even when implementing 'best practice', regular (at least 5-yearly) reviews of 'alternative measures' are needed to ensure measures continue to contribute to reductions in mortalities. There is no SG60 because it is assumed that at least one such review took place in order for the current measures to minimise mortality to be implemented. At SG80, if the additional 'alternative measures' are shown to be more effective than current measures, these should be implemented unless they:

- · Negatively affect crew safety, or
- · Unduly affect target species catch (i.e. more than 10%), or
- · Negatively impact on other species or habitats.

For example, in the longline fishery 1 example above, bird-scaring lines have led to a demonstrable reduction in bird mortalities between the years 2000 and 2005. However, from 2005 to 2020 the level of mortality has remained around 0.05 birds/1,000 hooks. In real terms, this represents hundreds of individual mortalities of seabird units A, B, and C annually. The UoA would need to demonstrate whether any other 'alternative measures' had been considered and whether they had been implemented. If not implemented, justification for not doing so, in relation to the scoring requirement, would be required in order to meet SG80.

In the longline fishery 1 example, night-setting was reviewed in 2018 as an 'alternative measure'. It was demonstrated to reduce the mortality of seabird units A and B but increase the mortality of nontarget fish species and seabird unit C. This measure was therefore not implemented. This would demonstrate that SG80 was met. However, if this review did not also consider 'best practice' measures for seabirds and longlines, such as forms of line weighting, it would not meet SG80.

## GSA3.12 Habitats outcome PI (PI 2.3.1) ▲

## Treatment of impact not caused by the UoA

Only the impact of the UoA itself is used to determine the status of the habitat. However, if activities unrelated to the UoA (including other anthropogenic activities or natural events) have had an impact on the habitat, the team should assess the UoA's relative impact as per GSA3.3.

## Treatment of 'more sensitive' habitats

An individual UoA may achieve an SG80 score in the outcome PI 2.3.1 when fishing on a 'more sensitive' habitat because its individual impact is unlikely to cause the 'more sensitive' habitat serious and irreversible harm. However, the MSC recognises the unique value of 'more sensitive' habitats and the possibility that all fishing, where all fishing includes all MSC UoAs plus other fisheries, may nevertheless be causing 'more sensitive' habitats to fall below 80% of their unimpacted state. Therefore, unless there is a comprehensive management plan covering all fishing impacts on the 'more sensitive' habitat, under the management PI 2.3.2 (see SA3.13.2.1), the MSC requires that UoAs avoid 'more sensitive' habitats even if they score higher than 80 on the outcome PI 2.3.1.

## GSA3.12.1 Habitat structure and function ▲

The team's assessment should take into account both the impact on the habitat and on the habitat's delivery of ecosystem services. For example, if only a part of the habitat is affected by fishing but this part delivers the greatest ecosystem services, the team should take this into account in the assessment.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.12.2 Habitat characteristics ▲

Usually, habitats impacted by the UoA are benthic habitats (i.e. are associated with, or occur on, the bottom) rather than pelagic habitats, which are near the surface or in the open water column. However, the team may consider impacts on:

- · The biotic aspects of pelagic habitats.
- · Habitats that the gear may accidentally come into contact with if gear loss or malfunction were to occur. This is required to meet SG100 under the management PI 2.3.2 (SA3.13.2.2.b)

The team may use Box GSA8 to categorise the habitats encountered by the UoA, according to their SGB status.

## GSA3.12.3 ▲

The team should use a precautionary approach when determining whether a habitat impacted by a UoA is 'less sensitive' or 'more sensitive'.

## Unimpacted habitat structure and function

Unimpacted habitat structure and function (i.e. unimpacted habitat state) is used in determining whether habitats are 'less' or 'more sensitive'. The team should therefore consider the following:

For habitats that have been afforded protection by a competent authority:

- · If the habitat was already impacted by any fishery at the time it was afforded protection, and all the impact occurred after 2006, the unimpacted state is the idealised expected recovery state.
- · If the habitat was already impacted by any fishery at the time it was afforded protection, and some or all the impact occurred before 2006, the unimpacted state is the current state of the habitat at the time it was afforded protection.
- · If the habitat was not impacted at the time it was afforded protection, the unimpacted state is the current state of the habitat at the time it was afforded protection.

The idealised expected recovery state is the unimpacted state as defined in a recovery plan, or assumed from modelling predictions, or comparisons with historical data and/or adjacent habitats.

For habitats that have not been afforded protection by a competent authority, the unimpacted state is that which is:

- · Defined in a recovery plan, or
- · As assumed from:
- o Modelling predictions, or
- o Comparisons with historical data, or
- o Adjacent or comparable habitats.

If the unimpacted state has not been defined, and cannot be assumed from available information or data, it should be considered as the state of the habitat in year 2006. The year 2006 is the date of the

UNGA Resolution 61/105 84 . In this instance, there is an acceptance that the UoA should not be penalised for historical damage (i.e. damage prior to 2006).

## Habitat recovery

Habitat recovery relates to the whole habitat, not just some species within the habitat. Likelihood of recovery should take into account the likely speed of recovery, as well as the certainty of recovery of a habitat.

The MSC has nominated the 80% level as a reasonable point at which to expect most of the habitat's structure and function (including abundance and biological diversity) to have been restored, taking into consideration the likely logistic population growth of habitat-forming organisms.

The team may consider using the Benthic Impacts Tool (Tool C of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox) to help determine recovery rates of habitats and inform scoring of PI 2.3.1 (a).

## GSA3.12.3.1 FAO Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems ▲

FAO Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) are habitats that have been designated as such by a competent authority, based on the VME criteria as defined in the International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas 85 .

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.12.4 'Serious or irreversible harm' to 'less sensitive' habitats ▲

The hypothetical climax state is the state to which a habitat would eventually recover to in the absence of all fishing, when considering existing environmental and anthropogenic conditions. Climax states are generally considered to be stable, and towards the end of ecological succession.

'Less sensitive' habitats should not be retrospectively classified as 'more sensitive' habitats if unable to recover to at least 80% of their hypothetical climax state within 20 years if fishing were to cease entirely.

For 'less sensitive' habitats, in a situation where the area fished by a UoA is no more than 20% of the overall range of that habitat and the habitat structure and function is understood to be broadly consistent across fished and unfished areas, the team should consider that the habitat would be able to recover to at least 80% of its hypothetical climax state within 20 years if fishing were to cease entirely as required at SG100.

<!-- image -->

## GSA3.12.5 'Serious or irreversible harm' to 'more sensitive' habitats ▲

In the case of 'more sensitive' habitats, 'serious or irreversible harm' is a reduction in habitat structure and function below 80% of the unimpacted state. The unimpacted state is as defined in GSA3.12.3.

The MSC's intent is to not hold UoAs responsible for historical damage to 'more sensitive' habitats unless they were responsible for such impact after the date the habitat was recognised as requiring

protection. This date could either be the date the habitat was afforded protection by a competent authority, or 2006, whichever is earlier.

If a habitat is currently below 80% of its unimpacted state but the impact was clearly caused by other MSC UoAs, non-MSC fisheries, or prior to the date the habitat was recognised as requiring protection, then the team should consider that UoA meets at least SG60, as long as the UoA avoids the habitat until:

- · The habitat has recovered to at least 80% of its unimpacted state, and
- · There is a comprehensive plan showing that all fishing will allow the habitat to be maintained to at least 80% of its unimpacted state.

If the UoA was responsible for the impact after the date the habitat was recognised as requiring protection, the team should consider that the UoA does not meet SG60 unless the UoA undertook immediate action to avoid the habitat.

The team should not consider minimal damage that occurs to an FAO-designated VME when a moveon rule is triggered as 'serious or irreversible harm', even when the habitat is below 80% of its unimpacted level.

The team may consider the pre-existing historical extent of 'more sensitive' habitats if:

- · The historical extent is known.
- · Recovery in those areas of historical extent would be possible.

## Example

Off the north coast of Australia, several shelf-break VME areas have been damaged but are still there in reduced form and would recover if left undisturbed for several years. Therefore, the team should consider these areas within the scope of the habitat's recovery.

## Examples of recovery rates and resulting habitat

Figure GSA5 and Table GSA6 provide some examples of recovery rates and resulting habitat status in some hypothetical situations. For each of these examples, it is assumed that the UoA is the only one impacting the habitat; therefore, all fishing impacts on the habitat are covered by 1 UoA. If multiple UoAs were impacting the habitat, the impact of individual UoAs would be less.

## Example A

The dotted line represents the current status, in relation to unimpacted status, of the habitat impacted by a moderate-impacting UoA; for example, demersal longline. This UoA:

- · Has an impact on 60% of the entire distribution of this habitat type.
- · Fully protects 40% of the habitat type inside a closed area, which is not shown in figure.

Because the gear has a moderate impact, the habitat status in the fished parts of the habitat is 50% of the unimpacted level. The recovery rate for this habitat type is fast, and it is likely that the overall status of the habitat would rise above 80% of the unimpacted level in around 5 years. Combined with the unimpacted status of the habitat in the closed area, this means that the habitat would recover to 80% of the unimpacted level in 5 years, achieving at least an 80 score and potentially a higher score if there is greater confidence supported by evidence for this expected recovery.

## Example B

The dotted and dashed line represents the status of the habitat impacted by a UoA with a high impact, such as demersal trawl. This UoA:

- · Protects 40% of the habitat type.
- · Fishes the other 60%.

The status of the impacted habitat area is shown in the figure but the status of the habitat within the protected area is not shown.

Since this is a high-impacting gear, the habitat has been degraded in the fished areas to 10% of the unimpacted level. This habitat is not very resilient, barely reaching the 80% level in 20 years and not reaching it in 5 years. Across both the closed area and the impacted areas, the UoA would be unlikely to be causing 'serious or irreversible harm' but with less confidence than in example A, possibly achieving an SG60 score.

## Example C

The solid line represents the same high-impacting UoA that:

- · Protects 40% of a slow-growing habitat.
- · Fishes the other 60% of that habitat.

The fished habitat has been degraded to 10% of the unimpacted level. This habitat has a very slow recovery rate and will take more than 20 years to reach the 80% unimpacted level. This UoA is, therefore, causing serious or irreversible harm to this habitat and would be unlikely to score a 60.

Table GSA6 provides additional details on the UoAs and habitats to accompany the examples provided in Figure GSA5.

Rows A-H illustrate in a qualitative sense how the overall habitat status could be estimated, both at the current time and in the future depending on:

- · The extent of habitat protection in a closed area.
- · The level of habitat degradation outside the closed area.
- · The habitat recovery rate.

Any current scenario that results in the status of the overall habitat being less than 80% of the unimpacted level is considered 'serious or irreversible harm'. Row I gives the likelihood of the UoAs causing 'serious or irreversible' harm (see Table SA8), and Row J gives the corresponding MSC scores.

## GSA3.12.6 Area of consideration ▲

The 'managed area' is the UoA's overall fishery management area, which will usually be wider than the area in which the UoA actually operates (i.e. the UoA area). This is to ensure by default the consideration of habitat impacts within the areas controlled by the management regimes under which the UoA operates. The management regime may be:

- · A single exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
- · A combination of EEZs, in the case of a UoA that fishes on a shared stock.
- · A combination of an EEZ and an RFMO.
- · Entirely an RFMO.

For many UoAs, the managed area may be only part of an EEZ; for example, the jurisdictional area for the UoA or the area covered by a management plan under which the UoA operates.

There are 2 types of exceptional case:

- 1. Situations where the range of the habitat(s) is much smaller than the area of the governance body's control, for example:
- · Where the RFMO covers an entire ocean but the habitat is restricted in distribution.
- · Where it is not sensible to consider the entire area because areas under that governance body's control are not contiguous or have quite different bio-physical and habitat characteristics.
- 2. Situations where the managed area is extremely restricted, such as cases where an EEZ has only a very narrow extent because of encroaching baselines of adjoining EEZs, and it does not make sense to consider such a narrow habitat within the assessment.

## Examples of these exceptional cases

- · CCAMLR manages fishing throughout the Southern Ocean. Clearly, it would not be appropriate or feasible to include the entire area covered by CCAMLR when considering the range of the habitat(s) affected by vessels fishing only in the Ross Sea.
- · A fishery that operates mainly in the Norwegian Trench overlaps with the North Sea and the Norwegian EEZ. These latter 2 areas cover more than 3 million km 2  in total. It is likely that the UoA is fishing a relatively small portion of this total area and therefore impacting a small portion of the habitat(s). Again, it would not be reasonable to consider the entire range of the habitat(s) across the total area.
- · The Gambia coastline is only 800km long and the EEZ is only 19,500km 2 . Several habitats extend along much of the western coast of Africa, extending into other EEZs. Given the small area controlled by the Gambian government, it would be appropriate to consider the entire range of the habitat(s) beyond the Gambian EEZ.

In such exceptional cases, it would be reasonable for the team to scale up or scale down the 'managed area' when determining the appropriate habitat range to consider. The team should apply expert judgement and provide rationale for such scaling.

In a nested management situation, the team should consider the widest management range. However, the examples given above for management regimes may apply.

## GSA3.12.6.4 Habitat outside the 'managed area' ▲

Since different habitat types are scored as separate elements, there may be situations when a particular habitat (or element) extends beyond the 'managed area'. In such situations, if the habitat extends significantly beyond the 'managed area', and as such, the 'managed area' is a relatively small portion of the habitat's overall range, then the team should take into consideration habitat outside the 'managed area'. However, if the 'managed area' covers a large part of the habitat's range, the 'managed area' itself will be sufficient for scoring.

## GSA3.13 Habitats management strategy PI (PI 2.3.2) ▲

When scoring the habitat PIs, the team should consider any habitat-specific management that exists for the 'managed area'.

## The MSC's approach to management of 'more sensitive' habitats

The MSC's approach to the assessment of sustainability with regard to 'more sensitive' habitats is based on United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions (especially 61/105 86  and 64/72 87 ) and the FAO Guidelines for deep-sea fisheries 88 . The central requirements of the FAO Guidelines for designated VMEs are as follows:

- · A set of criteria for identifying VMEs.
- · Impact assessments to determine whether fishing activities are likely to produce significant adverse impacts on VMEs.
- · Acquisition of data to determine the fishing footprint and the interaction of fisheries with VMEs.
- · Development of a 'functioning regulatory framework' that includes regulations to protect VMEs.
- · In the absence of a 'functioning regulatory framework', establishment of an interim precautionary approach that allows for the development of appropriate CMMs to prevent significant adverse impacts on VMEs while preventing such impacts from taking place inadvertently and that consists of:
- o Closing of areas where VMEs are known or likely to occur.
- o Refraining from expanding the level or spatial extent of effort of vessels involved in deep-sea fisheries.

These elements are incorporated into the MSC requirements by requiring either a comprehensive management plan that determines that all fishing will not cause serious and irreversible harm to 'more sensitive' habitats (which includes designated FAO VMEs), or that MSC UoAs should avoid 'more sensitive' habitats individually and cumulatively. Given the complexity of undertaking an impact assessment on 'more sensitive' habitats, the MSC considers that most UoAs should choose to apply the simpler approach of avoiding 'more sensitive' habitats altogether.

For scoring issue (b) at the SG60 level, some examples of 'plausible argument' are general experience, theory, or comparison with similar UoAs or habitats.

The team should also take this approach as the desired outcome of the management measures/strategies for 'less sensitive' habitats.

## GSA3.13.2 ▲

If there is a 'more sensitive' habitat in the UoA's 'managed area', the team should score the management PI 2.3.2 in relation to both 'less sensitive' and 'more sensitive' habitats.

Table GSA3 provides generic guidance on the differences between 'measures', 'partial strategy', and 'strategy'. Table GSA7 provides examples of 'measures', 'partial strategies', and 'strategies' in terms of benthic habitats. These are only examples of such management levels and do not necessarily meet the whole of the scoring rationale requirements. The team should always use its expert judgement to determine how well, or otherwise, management measures, partial strategies, or

strategies are designed to ensure the UoA does not pose a risk of 'serious or irreversible harm' to relevant habitats.

A strategy should include regular review of 'alternative measures' to reduce the impact of the UoA on the habitat. The team should also consider appropriate 'alternative measures' determined in this review during the review of measures to minimise unwanted catch (PIs 2.1.2 and 2.2.2), particularly when making a decision on which measures to implement.

UoAs are expected to take appropriate action, within measures/strategies, to avoid impacting 'more sensitive' habitats. Precautionary measures/strategies to avoid encounters with 'more sensitive' habitats are also required, and these may include closed areas, move-on rules, frozen footprints, gear modifications (or restrictions), authorisation to undertake new fishing activities, and/or consideration of dFADs, taking into consideration their design, monitoring and retrieval strategies.

## GSA3.13.2.1 ▲

A partial strategy for a UoA using a pelagic gear or a low-impacting bottom gear, such as a gear with a footprint score of 1 in Table A28 in the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox, may not need to include requirements and implementations. The team should provide rationale in those cases. The team may find it useful to refer to the pelagic examples in Table GSA7.

## GSA3.13.2.2 ▲

A comprehensive management plan could also include avoidance measures to ensure that serious or irreversible harm to 'more sensitive' habitats does not occur.

Some damage to 'more sensitive' habitats is acceptable as long as overall 'serious or irreversible harm' to structure and function is avoided. If a strategy does not afford complete protection to all 'more sensitive' habitats in an area, this should be supported by an impact assessment to demonstrate that:

- · 'Serious or irreversible harm' is avoided.
- · 'More sensitive' habitats are not impacted by more than 20% of their unimpacted state

In cases where a comprehensive management plan is in place but the 'more sensitive' habitat is below the 80% recovery criterion, the plan should first allow the 'more sensitive' habitat to recover to at least 80% of its unimpacted state before fishing continues. In other words, the only allowance for continued fishing by MSC UoAs on a 'more sensitive' habitat is when:

- · There is a comprehensive plan that shows that all fishing will keep the 'more sensitive' habitat at 80% or recover it to 80%.
- · The 'more sensitive' habitat has recovered to, or is above, 80%.

A formal comprehensive impact assessment may not be necessary in all cases; for example, when benthic gear is prohibited but pelagic gear is permitted because there is insignificant risk to benthic habitats. See Table GSA7 for an example of a strategy for a pelagic UoA.

| Groundfish trawl UoA in offshore  zones with explicit links to other  species/multi-gear management  plans  Some closed areas within the  groundfish UoA prohibit use of any  bottom-contacting fishing gear.

Midwater trawl UoA on continental slope where some seamounts are encountered and rare bottom contact is made

In acknowledgement that these features can be considered FAOdesignated VMEs (or more sensitive habitats), some seamounts are afforded strict protection from any bottomcontacting gear, including midwater trawl gear, and there is a complete ban on the use of bottom/otter trawl gear on all seamounts. This gear restriction constitutes the key part of the UoA management strategy.

UoAs in the area do not cause serious or irreversible harm to habitats. There are some efforts aimed at understanding how specific strategies might work in relation to the various habitats impacted by the community's fishing. Despite the cultural context and relatively small scale of individual UoAs, the total approach does not add up to a strategy within a functioning regulatory framework that is directed specifically at management of habitat impacts of the UoA or other MSC UoAs.

The strategy is cohesive by virtue of permitting only midwater trawling on any seamount in the region. The functioning regulatory framework is explicit with the ban on bottomcontacting gear on all seamounts and as such represents a precautionary approach. Other MSC UoAs are also required to comply with these rules. Managers have implemented a mechanism to avoid contact with VMEs (seamounts) by mandating the use of only non-bottom-contact gear. However, while the strategy is designed to avoid serious or irreversible harm to these habitats, it can only be considered a partial strategy . This is because it relies upon the generally accepted rarity of bottom contact by midwater trawls and other gear rather than an explicit means of understanding the effectiveness of the management approach in ensuring that serious and irreversible harm is not happening to seamounts or the mechanism that might need to be in place if it ceases to be effective.

Management is cohesive and strategically aimed at managing the impacts of the UoA, other MSC UoAs, and non-MSC fisheries on relevant habitats within a comprehensive ecosystem-based management plan. There are a suite of measures and tools available and evidence of their use. Ecological risk and impact

A bioregional marine planning framework uses an ecosystembased fisheries management approach involving ecological risk assessments and risk-management planning for fish. Precautionary management approach to risks identified for habitats includes closed areas for a variety of gear (that may change from year to year) and a system of marine protected areas (MPAs), offering more permanent protection from any bottom-contacting gear.

assessments have been carried out and have determined that all fishing activity will not cause serious or irreversible harm to habitats, including more sensitive habitats. There is active management seeking to reduce the impact of the UoA on both essential fish habitat and other habitats that were rated higher risk from an ecosystemmanagement perspective, including more sensitive habitats. The management plan has clearly articulated objectives relating to the habitats component and sets out how management will be modified if undesirable impacts are detected. Monitoring and evaluation are enshrined within the management plan and are directed at understanding fishing impacts on habitats, as well as the usual species-related monitoring and evaluation. Explicit strategies aim to manage the cumulative impacts of fishing, by the UoA, other MSC UoAs, and non-MSC fisheries, on habitats in order to avoid serious or irreversible harm .

Management is cohesive and strategic, aimed specifically at managing fishing impacts on species, habitats, and other ecosystem components within a comprehensive management plan. Several measures are in place, and research, monitoring, and evaluation are aimed at understanding the impacts of the UoA on habitats. Management strategies (e.g. plans) contain explicit mechanisms for modifying fishing practices based on unacceptable impacts coming to light through research, monitoring, or evaluation. There is evidence these have been implemented to modify fishing impacts on relevant habitats. As this is one of the most comprehensive and cohesive management approaches, both less sensitive and more sensitive habitats, as well as cumulative impacts are explicitly considered by managers in the risk assessment and management process, the research strategy , and the

## GSA3.13.3.3 ▲

An MSC UoA needs to have some way of assessing whether the actions of all MSC UoAs and other non-MSC fisheries, where relevant, are applicable to the avoidance of impacts on more sensitive habitats. An area may be closed to fishing by the management entity, or by a client fishery or nonMSC fishery (prior to the management entity doing so). The team should consider all of these closed area scenarios when scoring the UoA. For instance, a 'precautionary VME closure' might be declared by a trawl UoA on triggering a move-on rule, and MSC UoAs impacting in that closed area would be required to respect this closure under the requirements of the management PI 2.3.2. However, other measures, such as changing to a semi-pelagic gear, may not be relevant or appropriate for other MSC UoAs.

## GSA3.14 Habitats information PI (PI 2.3.3) ▲

## Assessing informal approaches against PI 2.3.3

The team should consider whether information is available to understand:

- · The distribution of habitat.
- · The impact of the UoA on habitat.

The team should factor in the likelihood of changes within the UoA that could lead to an increase in the risk of impact from fishing activity over time.

The team should consider whether information is collected to detect these changes to ensure that the UoA is moving in the desired direction or operating at a low-risk level.

Examples of information type include:

- · Local knowledge or research from fishers or community members.
- · Place-based information that is local to a particular geographical area.
- · Information with social, economic, or ecological dimensions.

The information will reflect the knowledge and opinions about issues held by individuals and groups local to the UoA. Local knowledge can be valuable first-hand experience that might provide information on a wide range of topics, including:

- · Habitat distribution and range.
- · Gear impacts on local habitats.
- · Gear and UoA spatial overlap with habitats.
- · Scale and intensity of the UoA.
- · Depending on the scale of the UoA, this information could be collected through informal stakeholder processes or a less subjective review process.

## Scoring issue (c) - monitoring ▲

When scoring issue (c) at the SG80 level, the team should consider all potential increases in risk, such as changes in:

- · The scoring of the outcome PI.
- · The operation of the UoA.
- · The effectiveness of the measures.

## GSA3.15.4 'Key' ecosystem elements ▲

'Key' ecosystem elements may include:

- · 'Key' prey, predators, and competitor species.
- · Predator-prey interaction.
- · Food web interactions.
- · Community composition.
- · Carrying capacity.
- · Species biodiversity.
- · Genetic diversity.
- · Migratory behaviour.

## GSA3.15.5 Indirect impacts on ETP/OOS species ▲

Indirect effects of the UoA on ETP/OOS species are those that result in changes to the 'key' ecosystem elements as identified above.

The team is required to evaluate whether any of the impacts of the UoA on 'key' ecosystem elements indirectly impact ETP/OOS units and hinder their recovery. Indirect effects of fishing may have positive or negative effects on ETP/OOS units. The MSC's intent is that any ecological effects of the UoA/OOS do not hinder the long-term viability of the ETP/OOS unit, and thereby also cause 'serious and irreversible harm' to the ecosystem. Types of indirect effects may include:

- · Changes to trophic structure or function.
- · Removal of biomass as food source for the ETP/OOS unit (including localised depletions) or its prey (trophic interactions).
- · Addition of biomass due to discards or offal discharge.
- · Changes to essential habitat for the species.

The team should provide rationale on which indirect effects, if any, it has considered in relation to the ETP/OOS unit. The team should provide detail of methods used to evaluate these effects.

The following case studies illustrate how indirect effects have explicitly been considered and managed within different fisheries. They provide examples of where the team should consider indirect impacts on ETP/OOS units, and how these relate to key ecosystem elements.

CCAMLR has an objective to conserve marine living resources. This includes preventing changes or minimising risk of changes in the marine ecosystem that are potentially not reversible over two to three decades 90 .

An example of how this objective is operationalised is that CCAMLR considers the needs of dependent predators such as marine mammals and seabirds when setting quotas for krill harvesting. Krill is an important prey species for seals, cetaceans, and penguins in the Southern Ocean. Indirect impacts of the krill fisheries include removal of krill as prey species, with localised depletion being a key concern given the patchiness of the krill resource 91  and references therein). CCAMLR sets a precautionary catch limit that ensures at least 75% of pristine krill biomass is maintained, and to prevent localised depletion an additional cap is set which cannot be exceeded until the catch is sub-divided into small spatial units 92 . In addition, the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, in whose waters a proportion of the krill fishery takes place, include a number of additional protection measures including a closed season during the times when key predators are breeding, coastal protection zones to reduce competition with landbased predators 93 . Indirect impacts from the UoA on ETP/OOS units should be considered as part of whether the UoA is likely to cause serious and irreversible harm to the predator-prey ecosystem element.

## Case study 2: Burry Inlet cockle fishery

The Burry Inlet hand-raked cockle fishery is managed by Natural Resources Body for Wales (NRW), whose overall aim in managing the fishery is to develop a thriving cockle fishery that supports, protects, and enhances the needs of the community and the environment on which it

depends  94 . The Burry inlet is a Special Protection Area under the European Commission Directive 79/409 on the conservation of wild birds and is also a Ramsar site 95 . The large estuarine complex supports internationally or nationally important wintering populations of wildfowl including (amongst many others) pintail, shelduck, shoveler, oystercatcher, knot, and redshank 96 .

Cockles are a key prey source for many overwintering birds in the Burry Inlet, so the indirect impact of the fishery relates to removal of biomass as a food source for bird species. To ensure that the fishery does not adversely impact the bird species whilst also maintaining a cockle resource for continued exploitation, a TAC is established each year for the fishery based on the results of twiceannual stock assessment surveys and the food requirements of the overwintering birds of the Burry Inlet 97 . A Bird Food Model is used to calculate the food requirements of birds, modelled based on the mean of peak counts of oystercatchers over recent years and information from the literature on energy requirements of the birds and energy content of shellfish 98 . The catch returns from the licensed fishers are monitored to see how much cockle is being removed each month in relation to the set TAC. This enables the TAC or daily quota to be amended if necessary to ensure enough food is left for the birds, as well as to ensure sustainable resource use 99 .

The team should consider indirect impacts from the UoA on ETP/OOS units as part of whether the UoA is likely to cause 'serious and irreversible harm' to the predator-prey ecosystem element.

## GSA3.16 Ecosystem management strategy PI (PI 2.4.2)

## Scoring issue (a) - management 'strategy' in place ▲

See SA3.4.1 for more details on 'measures', 'partial strategy' and 'strategy'.

## GSA3.16.2 Interpreting 'strategy' ▲

At SG80 and SG100, partial strategies and strategies, respectively, may contain measures designed and implemented to address impacts on components that have been evaluated elsewhere in this framework.

If the measures address specific ecosystem impacts effectively enough to meet the appropriate standard, it is unnecessary to have special 'ecosystem measures' to address the same impacts.

UoAs should be capable of adapting management to environmental changes as well as managing the effect of the UoA on the ecosystem.

## GSA3.17 Ecosystem information/monitoring PI (PI 2.4.3)

## GSA3.17.1 Climate change ▲

The team should consider monitoring the effects of environmental change on the natural productivity of the UoAs as 'best practice'. The team should include recognition of the increasing importance of climate change.

## GSA4 Principle 3

## GSA4.1 General requirements for Principle 3 ▲

An MSC UoA might include only a sub-set of fishers, such as vessels, fleet operators, and individual fishermen within a wider fleet of fishers fishing for the same biologically distinct stock, using the same method, and under the same or similar management system or arrangements. However, the team should note that:

- · The management of the wider fleet that denotes the specific 'fishery' is the subject of assessment under the fishery-specific management system PIs.
- · The team may consider special or additional management arrangements or features unique to the vessels in the UoA. The team may reflect this in the scores under the fishery-specific management system PIs.

## Example

In some RFMOs, compliance can be the responsibility of a compliance committee, and sanctions can be brought by:

- · The RFMO itself in instances of loss of access to resources, such as when a Member's vessel is identified as IUU, or when there is loss of access by the Member itself.
- · The flag state of the vessel in violation.

For violations not in any way under the control of the national management authority of the fishery:

- · The fishery consisting of vessels from flag state X should not be held responsible for the noncompliance of flag state Y vessels.
- · If the fishery consists of vessels registered with flag state X, and the non-compliance is by vessels registered with flag state Y, its internal compliance should not be part of the assessment.

However, the team should consider the effectiveness of the following actions:

- · At the national level: the compliance of flag state X vessels.
- · At the RFMO level: the overall effectiveness of compliance to deliver sustainable outcomes.

| Type of jurisdiction                                                                                                              | Management system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Trans-boundary fish stocks, straddling fish  stocks, stocks of highly migratory fish species,  and discrete high seas fish stocks | When fish stocks are exploited by 2 or more  states, international law becomes relevant.  These multi-level management systems may  have a variety of jurisdictional arrangements  that might apply to that UoA. The team is  required to consider these jurisdictional  arrangements. |

## GSA4.1.3 Fisheries management bodies that are subject to international cooperation ▲

Under international law, as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and related instruments, the states concerned, including the relevant coastal states in the case of shared stocks, straddling stocks, and highly migratory species, are required to cooperate to ensure effective conservation and management of the resources.

The relevant instruments that set out these requirements are:

- · United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982).
- · United Nations Agreement for the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 1995
- · FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, 1995 (including the FAO Compliance Agreement of 1993).

The MSC considers UNFSA Article 10 and the UNCLOS requirements as a basis for MSC requirements relating to cooperation for UoAs that are subject to international cooperation for management of the stock. These requirements to cooperate should apply to:

- · UoA participants, even if cooperation is not formally required by the relevant RFMO/regional fisheries management arrangement (RFMA) or if an RFMO/RFMA does not exist.
- · UoAs in the high seas, even if the target species are not HMS, shared, or straddling stocks and are not formally covered by the UNFSA requirements.

The requirements are further elaborated in SA4.3.1-4.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.1.4.1 Informal or traditionally managed systems ▲

A key characteristic of management mechanisms and measures in traditionally managed or selfgoverning UoAs is that they may be undocumented or may not be formally ratified.

The CAB could use:

- · Semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders or other participatory tools to collect information. The information in the sample should be representative of the reality of the UoA.

- · Multiple stakeholder participatory approaches to cross-check opinions and views from different segments of the stakeholder community.
- · Both of the above to support the rationale and validate the conclusions provided for the scores as required in SA4.3.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.3 Legal and/or customary framework PI (PI 3.1.1) ▲

## Background

A fishery management system's local, regional, national, or international legal and/or customary framework is:

- · The underlying formal or informal supporting structure that incorporates all formal and informal practices.
- · Procedures and instruments that control or have an impact on a UoA. This includes policies and practices of both government and private sectors, and is not limited to:
- o Implementing agencies; for example, fisheries agencies and conservation agencies.
- o Fishery business groups; for example, catch sector cooperatives and industry associations.
- o Fishing vessel owners.
- o Indigenous groups.
- o Local civil society or community groups.
- · The government sector, including all applicable government systems, the courts, and the relevant parliamentary and regulatory bodies. The management system is the complex interaction of government legislation, industry, or customary practice. However, it may also include controls and practices in a UoA that result in 'hard' law or 'soft' law, which are accepted practice controls over actual on-water catching practices.

The team may consider governance structures and mechanisms introduced in a UoA to achieve certification to an ISEAL Code compliant international voluntary sustainability standard to be part of a customary framework. Nevertheless, this certification itself does not automatically qualify a fishery to meet MSC scoring requirements. The team should:

- · Review the legal and/or customary frameworks in place.
- · Reach a scoring determination based on its judgement.

## Assessing informal and traditional approaches

In all scoring issues in this PI, for management systems that are less clearly articulated, such as informal and traditional management systems, the team may determine the extent to which this scoring issue is met through:

- · Accepted norms.
- · Commonly held values.
- · Beliefs.
- · Agreed rules across the fishing communities of which the UoA is part.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - Compatibility of laws or standards with effective management ▲

The team may determine this by examining:

- · The presence or absence of the essential features of an appropriate and effective structure within which management takes place.
- · Whether those features are hard or soft.

- · Whether the framework has a focus on long-term management rather than short term.
- · How management manages risk and uncertainty.
- · Whether the framework is transparent and open to scrutiny, review, and adaptation as new information becomes available.

The essential features needed to deliver sustainable fisheries are defined by their relevance to achieving sustainable fisheries in accordance with P1 and P2 appropriate to the size and scale of the UoA, and may include:

- · Establishing when and where people can fish.
- · Who can fish.
- · How they may fish.
- · How much they can catch.
- · What they can catch.
- · Who they talk to about the 'rules' for fishing.
- · How they might gather relevant information and decide what to do with it.
- · How they know that people are abiding by whatever rules are made.
- · How they catch, sanction, or penalise wrongdoers.

With these features, the operational framework could be said to be compatible with local, national, or international laws or standards.

For a UoA not subject to international cooperation for management of the stock, national entities expected to cooperate on national management issues include regional and national management, state and federal management, indigenous groups, and other groups, as appropriate to the UoA under assessment.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - Resolution of disputes ▲

Issues and disputes involving allocation of quota and access to marine resources are outside the scope of an assessment against the MSC Fisheries Standard.

When there are no immediately obvious structures for dispute resolution, the team could use participatory techniques to:

- · Identify and evaluate the presence of dispute resolution mechanisms used in the UoA.
- · Obtain information on these dispute mechanisms.
- · Assess the effectiveness of such mechanisms.

To minimise the likelihood of subjectivity, the team should include participants and/or interviewees from a wide variety of stakeholder types and from stakeholders operating outside the UoA. Fishers may be able to draw up charts or use other visual or non-textual means to help explain or demonstrate the process for resolving conflicts in the UoA.

The team can determine the level of transparency and effectiveness of the systems by:

- · Using information on the proportion of stakeholders aware of the existence of any dispute resolution arrangements.
- · Examining history and stories of how disputes have been dealt with in the past.
- · Ascertaining whether the presence or absence of unresolved disputes can be considered significant indicators of the existence and/or effectiveness of dispute-resolution mechanisms.

The team can determine evidence of consistency with this requirement using field observations and structured interviews with fishers and fishing community leaders to ascertain the following:

- · The extent to which fishery participants are aware of established rights.

- · Responses in the past within the UoA to disputes over established rights.
- · Accepted norms and practice across the UoA that are supportive of such established rights.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (c) - Respect for rights ▲

This scoring issue encompasses groups of individuals with customary rights, as well as indigenous or aboriginal groups with established rights, who are dependent on artisanal or subsistence fishing for either food or livelihood.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.3.1.b.i Controversial unilateral exemptions to an international agreement ▲

When assessing whether the fishery is conducted under a controversial unilateral exemption to an international agreement, the team should consider:

- · The relationship between international and coastal state jurisdictions recognised by relevant international agreements.
- · Whether exemptions result in the implementation of a higher or lower level of conservation than are currently agreed by an international management body.
- · Whether the sustainable management of the fishery is undermined.

The team should interpret these terms as follows:

- · Controversial' means creating a controversy in the wider international community rather than simply between 2 states.
- · 'Unilateral' means arising from the action of a single state.
- · 'Exemption' means a refusal to join or abide by the rules of an international management body, or the taking of a reservation or exception to a measure adopted by such body, where in either case the effect is to undermine the sustainable management of the fishery.
- · 'International agreements' are those with a direct mandate for sustainable management of the resources affected by the fishery according to the outcomes in Principles 1 and 2.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.3.1.1 Cooperation ▲

With respect to UNFSA Article 10, the requirement under SG60 (SA4.3.1) applies to the generation of scientific advice, not its implementation (UNFSA Article 10 paragraphs d, e, f, and g). A framework for cooperation with other parties could include the ability for parties to coordinate scientific advice to respective management agencies.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.3.2.b Organised and effective cooperation ▲

At SG80, 'organised and effective cooperation' with other parties extends to UNFSA Article 10 paragraphs a, h, and j, and could include the establishment of appropriate cooperative mechanisms for effective monitoring, control, surveillance, and enforcement.

Further, at SG80 and SG100, the flag state(s) of vessels from the UoA should be participating either:

- · In a relevant RFMO or other arrangement as members, or
- · If membership is prohibited for political reasons, as a cooperating non-contracting party or cooperating non-member.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.3.3 Binding procedures ▲

At SG100, binding procedures governing cooperation with other parties could include agreement and compliance with CMMs to ensure the long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

## GSA4.3.4 Disputes that overwhelm the fishery ▲

The team should consider whether any outstanding disputes are of substantial magnitude and involve a significant number of interests such that the UoA is unlikely to meet the objectives of MSC Principles 1 and 2. However, the existence of disputes are of themselves not enough to stop a fishery from being eligible for certification. The existence of lawsuits is not considered a barrier to certification, as otherwise parties opposed to certification could lodge lawsuits to prevent an outcome they did not support. The team should use its best judgement to determine whether a dispute compromises the ability of the management system to provide sustainable management, either at the time of assessment or within the subsequent certification period.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.3.5.1 Formal and informal practices and procedures ▲

These practices or procedures could be formalised under rule of law or be informal but known through traditional or customary means.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.4 Consultation, roles, and responsibilities PI (PI 3.1.2) ▲

## Background

In scoring the PI, the team may consider the roles and responsibilities of the fishers in relation to their cooperation with the collection of relevant information and data, where relevant and/or necessary. Examples of relevant information and data include catch, discard, and other information of importance to the effective management of the resources and the UoA.

## Effectiveness of consultation processes

When evaluating the effectiveness of consultation processes, the team might consider the general absence of discrimination against any individuals and/or organisations from any known consultations. However, the team needs to support any such conclusions with valid information collected by rigorous and robust means.

Effective consultation processes within the management system should be appropriate to the scale, intensity, and cultural context of the UoA. This could include, but is not limited to, consultation at the level of broad policy development and at the level of research planning.

In multinational arrangements, there should be adequate consultation at the UoA's national and international level. Thus, for consultation requirements the team should assess:

- · The management authority, such as the coastal state or the flag state, dealing with the UoA directly.
- · The international organisation, where such exists.

The team is not required to score elements against this PI for:

- · Other non-UoA states that are members of the international organisation.
- · Members of a bilateral/multilateral arrangement.

## Assessing informal and traditional approaches

In some traditionally managed UoAs or in UoAs under self-governance, specific roles and responsibilities may not always be clearly articulated or immediately apparent. A range of entities, ad hoc committees, and other groups with a variety of labels, including NGOs, may have responsibility for different fishery management roles. The arrangements may not be formally codified but may be widely understood across the UoA.

The team may need to work with stakeholders to prepare simple governance, institutional, or system maps to verify the extent to which roles and responsibilities are defined across the management system.

In the absence of a documented consultation procedure, the team could demonstrate evidence to verify the extent and transparency of consultation processes by alternative means including:

- · Identifying the existence, content, and relative frequency of invitation letters to meetings.
- · Consideration of activities of the UoA's extension officers.
- · The use of local announcements.
- · The use of posters.
- · The extent of awareness of fishers about meeting agendas, meeting content and outcomes.

The CAB may need to interview fishers about selected case studies to determine how information collected from stakeholders has been used in the past.

If the team demonstrates that valid and rigorous methods were used, the team may consider information from such interviews as representative of how the information collected from stakeholders is generally used. Conducting interviews with different stakeholders and cross-checking the information is one way of validating the results.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - Consultation processes ▲

The intent of scoring issue (b) is that:

- · The management system is open to stakeholders.
- · Information viewed as important by those parties can be fed into and considered by the process in a way that is transparent to the interested stakeholders.

When determining that a process 'regularly' seeks and accepts information, the team should use its expert judgement to determine what frequency of review is appropriate. It is not necessary that the definition of the term 'regularly' is the same in all contexts throughout the MSC Fisheries Standard, as different frequencies of review may be appropriate in different contexts.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.4.1 Transparency ▲

Meeting SG100 may not necessarily require additional reporting beyond what may already occur in a fishery management system. Examples include:

- · Regular newsletters, broadcasts, or reports that go out to stakeholders.
- · Information pages published and distributed.
- · A public record of the minutes of meetings, including use of email or other e-technologies.
- · Report-back meetings or other such means of reporting when stakeholders do not have access or ability to read reports, do not watch broadcasts, or do not use computers.

The team should verify that the evidence offered:

- · Meets the standard of demonstrating consideration of the information, hence is transparent.
- · Explains how the information was or was not used.

A UoA cannot meet SG100 without being transparent on how provided information is or is not used.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.4.5 Local knowledge ▲

'Local knowledge':

- · May be long-term knowledge held by many fishers or the community.
- · May be location-based, so local to a particular geographical area.
- · May have social, economic, or ecological dimensions.
- · Will reflect the knowledge and opinions about issues held by individuals and groups local to relevant UoAs.

'Local knowledge' can be valuable first-hand experience that might inform any fisheries management process, including:

- · Fisheries research.
- · Data collection.
- · Resource assessment.
- · Monitoring, control, and surveillance operations.
- · Policies and processes.
- · Fisheries management policies, practices, and/or decisions.

Evaluation of the relative value and robustness of local knowledge in the management process may form part of the process of being transparent about how information is considered and used or not used under SG80 and SG100.

Individuals or groups as referred to in SA4.4.5 could include, but not be limited to:

- · Fishers.
- · Indigenous people.
- · Local community representatives or groups.
- · Local civil society groups, such as local NGOs.
- · Local fishing businesses and/or their representatives.
- · Local-government representatives.
- · Politicians.

## GSA4.5 Long-term objectives PI (PI 3.1.3) ▲

## Background

Where UoAs fall under dual control, the objectives of the management agency controlling those UoAs are the subject of PI 3.1.3. Examples of UoAs under dual control include:

- · Internationally managed UoAs where management falls to both a national agency and a bilateral/multilateral agreement or organisation.
- · Federally managed UoAs that have some provincial or state management component.

This PI deals only with the broader management policy context, which could exist within overarching legislation, or policy or custom that applies to many or all UoAs within a broader management system. Consideration should focus on whether laws, policies, practices, or customs at that higher level imply and/or require long-term objectives that are consistent with the precautionary approach.

## Scoring issue (a) - Objectives assessing informal approaches in PI 3.1.3 ▲

The CAB could infer consistency with scoring issue (a) by the practices operating within the UoAs covered by the management system.

The CAB could use the following to evaluate the UoA's performance against this scoring issue:

- · A review of the factors that have influenced recent decisions in the UoA.
- · Knowledge of the extent to which such factors are consistent with achieving sustainability.
- · The application of the precautionary approach.

The team should consider whether decisions have been taken:

- · On the basis of the ecological health of the UoA and associated ecosystems, or
- · For other reasons that are not compatible with achieving sustainability over the long term.

When scoring this PI, the team should focus on the consistency of any long-term objectives within overarching management policy. The team should expect the UoA to be cautious when information is uncertain, and to take action even when information is inadequate.

This PI is important to the overall understanding of the use or otherwise of a precautionary approach in the UoA. However, it is not concerned with the operational implementation of the precautionary approach within the 'day-to-day' management of the UoA itself.

## This PI is not:

- · A second opportunity to score UoAs on the use of target and LRPs, which are scored under P1 of the default tree.
- · A second opportunity to refer the team to Article 6, Annex II of the Fish Stocks Agreement for a prescriptive list of what is required to appear in management policy in relation to the precautionary approach.
- · A direction to rescore management strategies or outcomes covered both in P1 and P2, or decision-making processes covered in a separate PI under P3, where precaution and the precautionary approach are also mentioned.

## GSA4.7 Fishery-specific objectives PI (PI 3.2.1)

## Scoring issue (a) - objectives assessing informal and traditional approaches ▲

In some traditionally managed fisheries, or fisheries under self-governance, objectives may not always be stated quantitatively or be expressed in a way that is specific to the particular species or fishery. Objectives may specify social and/or economic objectives. In some fisheries, objectives may be defined in terms of addressing further declines, rather than specifically maintaining optimum yields or biomass levels.

The team can determine compliance of the fishery with MSC requirements by considering how well these variously formulated objectives align with achieving sustainability as per Principles 1 and 2. Objectives that are defined to meet social needs may in some cases be consistent with achieving sustainability as articulated in Principles 1 and 2. However, to be consistent with achieving sustainability, such objectives should not be designed to meet social needs at the expense of ecological considerations. The team should determine whether the fishery is subject to considerations that may lead the emphasis on social or economic objectives to pose potential risks to achieving the outcomes required by Principles 1 and 2.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.7.2 Measurable objectives ▲

## Example

An example of an explicit 'measurable' objective is 'the impact on dependent predators will be reduced by x% over y years'.

## GSA4.8 Decision-making processes PI (PI 3.2.2)

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - decision making processes ▲

The CAB should interpret 'established' decision-making processes to mean that:

- · There is a process that can be immediately triggered for fisheries-related issues.
- · The process has been triggered in the past and has led to decisions about sustainability in the fishery.

These processes may or may not be formally documented or codified under an official statute.

Key considerations for assessing whether the system is well established or not include:

- · The extent to which the system is recognised by stakeholders in the fishery.
- · The durability or permanency of the decision-making process.

The team may need to use semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders to obtain information about how any decision-making process works. The team may need to select a case study event and determine from interviews whether and how decisions were made in response to the event. Appropriate case study events include:

- · A stock decline in the past.
- · A specific observation across the fishery.
- · Other ecological change.

As with general requirements relating to the use of semi-structured interviews, the team should provide evidence of a means of cross-checking views and validating conclusions and scores.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - responsiveness of decision-making processes ▲

The team should consider all constituents and operational levels of the fishery-specific management system when assessing the responsiveness of decision-making. Where relevant, the team should ensure that the assessment of this scoring issue:

- · Recognises decision-making at the level most relevant to the UoA.
- · Is not unduly determined by decision-making in other constituents or levels of the fishery-specific management system.

For example, the nature and severity of issues arising at different levels of a management system may vary, as might the responsiveness of decision-makers to those issues. In a co-management situation, decision-makers may need to respond to issues not directly relevant to the management of the UoA.

Similarly, in a network of local management bodies, decision-making processes in one part of the network may be materially different to those in the UoA, despite both bodies being part of the same fishery-specific management system.

## Scoring issue (d) - accountability and transparency ▲

The CAB should interpret 'accountability' to mean that:

- · Management is answerable to stakeholders on management of the fisheries.
- · The answerability of management is demonstrated by the provision of information on the fishery to stakeholders.

The data that are required to be available to stakeholders exclude data or information that are subject to national privacy and data protection regulation and laws associated with the fishery.

When considering public access to information on fisheries' performance and data, the team could consider:

- · The extent to which accurate and up-to-date data available to management are reported to the public or at least accessible on request to stakeholders.
- · The resolution of the available data.
- · Whether the data and information available are appropriate to the type and nature and of the fishery.
- · Whether the data and information available are of sufficient clarity to ensure meaningful engagement of stakeholders in the decision-making process.

The availability of information to stakeholders on actions taken by management that have implications for sustainable use of fisheries resource could include:

- · Availability of information, or at least non-confidentiality of information, on subsidies that may be considered to have implications for sustainability.
- · Availability of information, or at least non-confidentiality of information, on who, for example licence holders, has access to the resource.
- · Availability of information on infractions against fishery regulation and consequent penalties and/or fines.
- · Availability of information on outcomes and impact of management decision where such information is available.

## Scoring issue (e) - Approach to disputes ▲

When assessing the importance of any evidence relating to this issue, the team should consider whether any violations of the same law or regulations compromise the ability of the management system to deliver sustainable fisheries as per the outcomes in P1 and P2.

When assessing fisheries against this issue, the team may consider the extent to which there may be other or higher authorities to whom fishers or other stakeholders may appeal if they are dissatisfied with fishery rules or their implementation in the fishery by local managers.

If any such appeals have been made, the team should consider and score the responsiveness or otherwise of local managers or leaders.

The team may use semi-structured interviews to determine the extent to which stakeholders believe that local managers or leaders respect any judgements or decisions made by any higher or other authority.

The team can use the interviews to determine the extent to which:

- · Managers implement their own rules.
- · Stakeholders believe the management system is sufficiently proactive to avoid disputes.

The team may consider collective, participative, and publicly accountable involvement in management of the fishery by a broad spectrum of local stakeholders of the fishery as potential evidence of the presence of proactive avoidance of legal disputes. The team may use supporting evidence from

multiple and cross-checked, semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders representing different interests within the community.

## GSA4.9 Compliance and enforcement PI (PI 3.2.3) ▲

## Background

This requirement extends to compliance with management measures associated with MPAs and habitats, as well as other spatial management approaches. The team should judge compliance on the formal requirements of an MPA's management system relating to fishing activity, including any requirements for research and impact assessment, rather than with an MPA's objectives, which are unsupported by specific PIs (see GSA3.13 for discussion of habitat management strategies).

Box GSA9: MPAs and other spatial management approaches

MPAs and other spatial management approaches are potentially valuable management tools. In this context, the term 'MPAs' refers to the full range of MPA categories defined by the IUCN, from strict nature reserves to protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources, and 'other spatial management' including requirements that are part of fishery management arrangements or plans.

An MPA may or may not contribute to the delivery of a sustainable fishery and there is no explicit requirement to have MPAs or other spatial management approaches in place for fisheries to meet the MSC standard. However, the MSC does require that the effectiveness of the management system, to which an MPA or other approach may contribute, is sufficient to achieve:

- · The sustainability of fish and other species.
- · Ecosystem impacts.

## Assessing informal and traditional approaches

When evaluating the effectiveness of MCS in fisheries where a less-formalised MCS system exists, the team may consider the role and effectiveness of a range of factors in deterring illegal activity. These factors may include the following:

- · Social disapproval, such as public 'naming and shaming', for violating fishery customs, rules, or regulations important for sustainability.
- · Fines and penalties imposed by community institutions or other local bodies.
- · Prevailing norms.
- · Self-monitoring.
- · Presence of community fish watchers or wardens.
- · Accessibility to the resource.
- · Ability to smuggle catches onshore without detection.
- · Mobility and homogeneity of the members of the fishery.
- · Exclusivity of access and market-related factors such as value, demand, or preferences (for example, regarding size).

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance system ▲

An MCS system (SG80) is a suite of well-integrated mechanisms and tools that work together to improve compliance with regulations. An MCS system should cover all 3 dimensions of routine fishing operations 100  (as listed below), and include reporting requirements and physical inspections:

- · Prior to fishing (e.g. valid documentation, training and vessel set-up).
- · During fishing.
- · During landing of catch.

At SG100, a comprehensive MCS system is as described for SG80 and SA4.9.3, but should also be risk-based, adaptable, and able to respond to issues in a timely and transparent manner. It should include a process for compliance data acquisition and analysis and, where appropriate to the fishery, should include physical inspections both onshore and at-sea.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - sanctions ▲

At SG80 and SG100, the severity of sanctions and their likelihood to deter non-compliance should be appropriate and adequate to the UoA, such that they provide deterrence.

At SG100, comprehensive sanctions are those that can respond to a wide range of infringements, in various ways, in order to ensure effective deterrence. For example, the sanctions may be graduated (i.e. consist of a series of structured incremental sanctions of increasing severity) or multifaceted.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (d) - compliance outcome ▲

If a UoA has few non-compliance issues and infringements, it may be difficult to demonstrate effective enforcement of management measures. This scenario may not indicate highly effective MCS. Instead, it may imply that MCS is ineffective, and infringements are not being detected or recorded. In contrast, a high number of infringements within a UoA may imply an effective and transparent MCS system. The team should therefore use expert judgement when evaluating information from management authorities.

The team should consider regulations specific to governing sustainable fishing practices on the water as those associated with the 'how, what, where, and when' of fishing activities. They may include:

- · Regulations associated with gear restrictions.
- · Catch reporting, quota limits.
- · Landing obligations.
- · By-catch.
- · Spatial and temporal restrictions.

These regulations are important in achieving and maintaining sustainable fisheries and should therefore be considered at all jurisdictional levels.

The team should not consider regulations that are in place for purposes other than governing sustainable fishing practices; for example labour, maritime safety or pollution regulations.

100 FAO (2002) Chapter 8: Fishery monitoring, control and surveillance (Bergh, P.E. and Davies, S.). In A Fishery Manager's Guidebook - Management Measures and their Application (ed. Cochrane, K.L.). Fisheries Technical paper 424. Rome, Italy. 231pp.

The team should interpret 'systematic non-compliance' as recurring infringement of regulations in a coherent and coordinated manner. For example, if large number of fishers in the UoA are not complying with regulation(s) on a regular basis, the team should regard this as systematic noncompliance. Ad hoc infringements by individual fishers should not constitute systematic noncompliance. Systematic non-compliance demonstrates that the MCS enforcement mechanisms and sanctions in place are not effective in preventing frequent re-offence by the UoA. When assessing scoring issue (d), systematic non-compliance is specific to those regulations governing sustainable fishing practices on the water.

At SG80 and SG100, 'majority of regulations' is not restricted to regulations specifically governing sustainable fishing practices on the water (i.e. as defined at SG60). Instead, it should include regulations associated with the 3 dimensions of routine fishing operations outlined in 'Scoring issue (a) - Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance system' above. In considering whether the 'majority of regulations' are complied with for SG80 and SG100, assessors are not expected to perform quantitative analyses of the number of regulations that exist and are (or are not) complied with. Instead, assessors should consider whether there is a general culture of compliance with regulations.

## GSA4.10 Monitoring and management performance evaluation PI (PI 3.2.4) ▲

## Fishery-specific management system

In both scoring issues and in each SG under this PI, relevant parts of the fishery-specific management system may include:

- · A decision-making process that responds to both wider management issues of stock-wide and/or specific local stakeholder concerns.
- · Data collection.
- · Scientific research.
- · MCS: Compliance and enforcement PI 3.2.3.
- · Collaborating in and initiating a fishery-specific or national research plan.
- · Responding to feedback and response.
- · Monitoring systems as required by the management strategy and information PIs in P1 and P2.

## Assessing informal and traditional approaches

When assessing this PI, the team should consider:

- · Whether there are opportunities and/or forums for decision-makers to receive feedback on the management system.
- · Other practices such as exchange of information between the community and the management institution.
- · The regularity of such opportunities.

Where community organisations are operational, these monitoring systems can be self-determined. However, they require the support of an external evaluation from a higher authority, and evidence that specific checks may be made. The external authority might include provincial or national government agency, university, NGO, or donor.

To verify activities, the team should ensure compliance with the following indicators:

- · An effective organisational structure to implement decisions and corrective actions.
- · Evidence that policies are formulated, initiated, and monitored.
- · Where relevant, activities take account of community and scientific advice, which may include consideration of supporting risk assessments conducted by a scientific organisation or university.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

- · Evidence of an effective system of custodial management and self-determined fisheries control systems.

The team should not limit the review process to a sub-management or community organisation. It may be that national or provincial government departments delegate specific duties to sub-management organisations, where key parts of the management system require stock-wide management, beyond community level. In such cases, the team review should take into account:

- · Higher authorities and their performance in ensuring management against national and international measures.
- · Whether the correct tools are in place to ensure that appropriate decisions at the national level are passed down to the sub-management and community organisations.

<!-- image -->

## GSA4.10.1 External review ▲

Depending on the scale and intensity of the fishery, external review could be by:

- · Another department within an agency.
- · Another agency or organisation within the country.
- · A government audit that is external to the fisheries management agency.
- · A peer organisation, nationally or internationally.
- · External expert reviewers.

End of Section SA Guidance

## GSB Modifications to the default tree for enhanced bivalves - guidance ▲

## Foreword to Section GSB

Section GSB is intended to provide supplemental guidance and interpretation when applying:

- · The default assessment tree (Sections SA, GSA).
- · The modifications to the default assessment tree (Section SB) for assessing enhanced bivalve fisheries.

The numbering of sections in this Section corresponds to the equivalent sections in Section SB.

## GSB2 Principle 1

## GSB2.1 General requirements for Principle 1 ▲

Because bivalve culture cannot lead to exploitation rates that approach LRPs, it is not managed as such. Scoring enhanced CAG bivalve fisheries for P1 stock status is therefore not usually appropriate. However, the team should still determine that there is no threat to the target species. Once this has been determined, the team should confirm there is no need to:

- · Score P1.
- · Have a P1 expert on the team.

<!-- image -->

## GSB2.1.3 Translocation ▲

Translocations of marine shellfish have the potential to affect the genetic integrity of wild populations, depending on the scale of the translocation. The team should:

- · Examine each situation.
- · Provide rationale and evidence explaining the level of risk if it exists.

The team can achieve this by scoring the genetic outcome PI.

## GSB2.1.5 Scoring Principle 1 PIs ▲

To ensure that the exploitation of the source seed resource is properly managed, the team should score enhanced CAG bivalve fisheries involving translocations that remove seed stock from source locations against the following PIs:

- · Stock status.
- · Harvest strategy/control rules, and tools PIs.

Because it is problematic to assess stock size in relation to biomass or fishing mortality, the team may use the RBF (Tool A of the MSC Fisheries Standard Toolbox).

In addition to genetic impacts, moving shellfish from one geographic area to another can introduce disease and/or pests, which affect the parent stock and other species within the ecosystem. For CAG fisheries that involve translocation, the assessment team should examine each situation and provide rationale and evidence explaining the level of risk if it exists. The team can achieve this by scoring the translocation PIs within Principle 2.

Note that management bodies may define shellfish translocations based on movement of shellfish between/among areas where harvest is permittable or not (e.g. between areas with differences in water quality, or risk of pest or disease). As such, when determining risk from translocations in scoring, the team should consider any management measures in place, including efforts to address

potential disease and/or pest concerns to the species and geographic region where the individuals are out-planted. Examples of practices for managing disease and/or pest impacts from CAG enhancement include:

- · Guidance on identification of pest and disease species.
- · Detailed information on the current location and extent of pest and disease species.
- · Quarantine and control measures.
- · Licensing and permitting, whether that be for facilities, location(s), and/or translocation activities.

## GSB2.3 Genetic management PI (PI 1.2.5)

## Scoring issue (b) - plausible argument ▲

Examples of plausible argument used in scoring issue (b) may include general experience, theory, or comparisons with similar fisheries or species.

## GSB3 Principle 2

## GSB3.1

General requirements for Principle 2

## GSB3.1.2 ▲

There are normally no in-scope species captured in enhanced CAG bivalve fisheries based solely on spat collection. Therefore, the team does not need to score PIs for in-scope species. However, for fisheries where dredging may involve the capture of in-scope species, the team is required to score the in-scope PIs as per Section SA.

There is a potential for enhanced CAG bivalve fisheries to interact with ETP/OOS species.

## GSB3.1.4.2 ▲

For suspended culture systems, when scoring Principle 2 habitat PIs, the team should focus on the benthic impacts of bio-deposition and organic enrichment.

When scoring ecosystem PIs, the team should focus on issues relating to:

- · Carrying capacity.
- · The trophic effects of bivalve filtration/feeding.

Shellfish farming may occur where the natural benthic environment is already heavily enriched with organic matter prior to the initiation of any culture activities. In such cases, the team can compare measurements taken underneath farms to measurements taken in control sites outside the farm to show that the culture activity is not directly responsible for the anoxic conditions.

The team could apply the sulphide (S 2-)  methodology in justifying its scores for habitat status:

- · For SG60 , the team is required to justify that the fishery is ' unlikely' to reduce habitat structure and function to a point where there would be serious or irreversible harm. This could correspond to levels of total S 2-  in surficial sediment beneath farms of ≤ 3,000µM.
- · For SG80 , the team is required to justify that the fishery is ' highly unlikely' to reduce habitat structure and function to a point where there would be serious or irreversible harm. This could correspond to levels of total S 2-  in surficial sediment beneath farms of ≤ 1,500µM.
- · For SG100 , the team is required to justify that there is evidence that the fishery is ' highly unlikely' to reduce habitat structure and function to a point where there would be serious or irreversible harm. This could correspond to negligible levels of total S 2-  in surficial sediment beneath farms, such as would be found at background levels for that environment.

## Phytoplankton depletion/ecological carrying capacity

Methods for determining the impact of suspended bivalve farming operations on phytoplankton depletion range from simple clearance- and retention-time calculations to expensive and complex computer modelling of ecological carrying capacity of affected water bodies. While it can be difficult to account for all the variables involved in coastal ecological processes, the team can use simple calculations to determine whether or not production is 'likely' to be sustainable.

The main threat associated with the translocation of shellfish is the introduction of diseases, pests, or invasive species. It is important that the team assesses these risks through established protocol that is validated through independent scientific review. For general guidance on translocation, see FCP G7.7.1.2.b.

The removal of seed from an area either through dredging or spat collection may have P2 impacts.

## GSB3.2 Translocation outcome PI (PI 2.5.1)

## Scoring issue (a) - non-native species ▲

In scoring issue (a), the team should interpret 'non-native species' to mean a species not already established in the ecosystem.

## GSB3.3 Translocation management PI (PI 2.5.2)

## Scoring issue (b) - plausible argument ▲

Examples of plausible argument used in scoring issue (b) may include general experience, theory, or comparison with similar fisheries or species.

## GSB4 Principle 3

## GSB4.1 General requirements for Principle 3 ▲

In cases where P1 is not scored, when scoring P3, the team should focus only on the relevant management systems applicable to maintaining P2 outcomes.

End of Section SB Guidance

## GSC Modifications to the default assessment tree for salmon fisheries

## Foreword to Section GSC ▲

Section GSC provides guidance and interpretation in applying:

- · The default assessment tree (Section SA).
- · The modifications for salmon fisheries (Section SC), based on the above considerations.

The team should not deviate from this guidance without justification.

Salmon fisheries with an enhancement component are required to conform to the scope criteria in Table 1 of the Standard.

The CAB should interpret 'enhancement' as any activity aimed at:

- · Supplementing the survival and growth of 1 or more aquatic organisms, or
- · Raising the total production or the production of selected elements of the salmon populations beyond a level that is sustainable by natural processes.

## GSC1 General requirements

## GSC1.1.1 ▲

For the purposes of salmon assessments, the team should consider Section GSC guidance as taking precedence over Section GSA. Where no guidance is provided, the team should use Section GSA.

## GSC1.1.3 ▲

Examples of stock management units (SMUs) and populations are shown in Table GSC1.

Table GSC1: Terms and definitions

| Term       | Guidance to definitions in Annex SC                                                                                                                                                              |

## GSC2 Principle 1

## GSC2.1  General requirements for Principle 1

## GSC2.1.1 ▲

In P1, the complexity of salmon population dynamics requires that the team should consider the sustainable management of salmon at 2 levels 101 :

- · Level 1: the level of the SMU . The objective of management should be to:
- o Ensure that spawner abundance in the SMU is maintained at a level consistent with high production; for example, for a target such as spawner abundance at maximum sustainable yield (SMSY), or a proxy that reflects equal or lower risks to 1 or more populations.
- · Level 2: the level of the populations within an SMU . The objective of management should be to:

- o Ensure that the diversity and productivity of these populations are maintained at levels that ensure a high probability of persistence over time.
- o Enable them to rebuild to high production in time in the absence of fishing.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.2  Stock status PI (PI 1.1.1) ▲

In PI 1.1.1, the team should assess the status of an SMU in relation to reference points.

The definition of the SMU, establishment of its reference points, and design of its related management strategy should:

- · Take into consideration the need to manage populations within the SMU to reflect the different productivities and other features of those populations.
- · Follow the guidance for PIs 1.2.1 to 1.2.4 as appropriate.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - TRPs ▲

Examples of TRPs include target escapement goals and target harvest rates.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.2.1 ▲

Escapement-based reference points generally refer to spawner abundance only in assessments of current status relative to LRPs and TRPs. The team may, where other reference points are used, refer to GSA2.2.3. Example of other reference points include:

- · Target harvest rate.
- · Fishing mortality.
- · Other proxies.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.2.2 ▲

The team should evaluate whether achievement of spawning goals is solely for wild, natural-origin salmon, after excluding:

- · Hatchery fish.
- · The contribution from spawning channels.
- · Removal of fish for hatchery broodstock.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.2.2.1-2 ▲

The team should consider the following factors in estimating escapement of only wild fish:

- · Relative abundance of artificially produced versus wild salmon.
- · Presence and enumeration of artificially produced fish in the salmon fishery and on the wild spawning grounds.
- · The management system's intent as to how artificially produced fish are accounted for in meeting reference points.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.2.3 ▲

Scoring PI 1.1.1 for salmon fisheries can be complex. Where the following situations arise, the following guidance applies:

- · If there are no LRPs defined by management, as is often the case with salmon fisheries, the team should refer to GSC2.7.
- · If 15 years of data are not available, the team should apply equivalent percentages to the timeframe that is available.
- · If the TRP is expressed as a range, with an upper and a lower bound:
- o The SMU should have met or exceeded the mid-point of the escapement goal range, and/or
- o The team should look for evidence that directed fishing is lowered as the lower bound is approached.
- · The threshold levels in SC2.2.3.1 and SC2.2.3.3 assume an approximately random distribution of performance over the 15-year period. Where this is not the case, and there is instead a consistent trend downwards such that most of the failures to reach the escapement goals were in the most recent years, then SG80 is not met.
- · The team may consider each cycle line separately in the case of:
- o Species or stocks that display cyclic dominance, such as pink salmon where separate stock dynamics pertain to alternate years, or
- o Fraser sockeye where each cycle line spawns only every 4th year.

For example, the team may assess pink salmon even-year and odd-year populations separately.

Consideration of environmental variability and its impact on stock status is covered in SA2.2.7.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.3 Stock rebuilding PI (PI 1.1.2) ▲

The requirements for rebuilding salmon SMUs differ from those for other species in the following ways:

- · The complex structure of salmon stocks requires rebuilding strategies to account for specific populations that may have lower productivities than the SMU average. One example is effective differential harvest protection through proven time and area strategies to minimise harvest impacts on low-abundance or less-productive populations.
- · Reduced stock status may be caused by:
- o The fishery, in which case the rebuilding strategy is the responsibility of the fishery management agency.
- o Other human intervention such as habitat degradation or environmental change.
- · If reduced stock status is caused by human intervention and the impact is out of the management control of the fishery, the fishery response should take into account the multipurpose nature of the use patterns in those waterways. For example, the fishery management agency should adjust management goals either up or down to be appropriate to the new productivity of the system.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (c) - use of enhancement in stock rebuilding ▲

In scoring issue (c), use of enhancement in stock rebuilding, the team should consider the following:

- · Routine use of artificial production to meet escapement goals as a rebuilding strategy, and therefore mitigate 'overfishing' and maintain harvest rates that are not sustainable, would generally not meet SG60.
- · Habitat modification may be used occasionally to assist rebuilding.

Given that the focus of the MSC assessment is on wild stocks, there should be only limited and temporary use of such methods to rebuild wild stocks, consistent with MSC guidance on scope criteria for enhanced fisheries.

Under exceptional circumstances, use of hatchery production as a rebuilding strategy could be targeted at a specific population within an SMU that is severely depleted and has not responded to other significant management action. In the extreme case, this would include recovery hatchery programs (see GSC2.9) designed to prevent the extirpation of severely depleted populations. It is important that any population where artificial production is used as part of the rebuilding strategy is neither targeted by the fishery nor exposed to non-targeted harvesting that substantially hinders rebuilding attempts.

When an artificial production strategy is used, the team should consider it an interim strategy of short, finite duration in order to address immediate demographic risks to the population.

In such a case the team should:

- · Assess the circumstances driving the program.
- · Verify that the program has been carefully designed to contribute to the long-term viability of the depleted wild population.

Under these types of program, addressing demographic risks often results in unintentional interactions between cultured and wild fish that will exceed any routine interaction benchmarks.

## The rebuilding plan should:

- · Justify the need for enhancement tools, if used.
- · Evaluate the potential risk involved.
- · Define the time-bound duration for supplementation.
- · Include monitoring and evaluation of the supplementation effort to assess the natural population response in productivity, abundance, life history, and genetic diversity.

This is in compliance with the scope criteria for HAC fisheries as defined in SA1.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.3.1 ▲

In the default tree, PI 1.1.2 is triggered for any score below 80 in PI 1.1.1. However, salmon fisheries may score below 80 in PI 1.1.1 due to:

- · Reduced abundance,
- · A failure to enumerate hatchery origin fish in spawning escapements, or
- · A combination of the above.

PI 1.1.2 is only triggered when PI 1.1.1 scores below 80 due to a reduced stock status.

PI 1.1.2 is not triggered if the sub-80 score is due solely to a failure to enumerate artificially produced fish on the spawning grounds. In this case, the team should add a condition in PI 1.3.3.

## GSC2.3.2 ▲

The team should have a clear expectation of component population rebuilding except under welldocumented exceptional circumstances. None should remain chronically depressed relative to their biologically based limits or population-specific reference points, if estimated.

Evidence to verify that no fisheries are targeting or otherwise excessively harvesting populations that are below their LRP during the rebuilding period would include the use of specific and effective management strategies, to differentially avoid interception of those SMUs and depleted populations during fishing. The rebuilding timeframes for individual populations may exceed those for the SMU.

## GSC2.4 Harvest Strategy PI (PI 1.1.1)

## GSC2.4.1 ▲

Activities that demonstrate fisheries managers' attempts to minimise harvest on weak populations include:

- · Fisheries are managed to meet objectives at the SMU scale, but population-level units are also defined for conservation and research purposes.
- · Population-specific reference points are established, and stock status against those benchmarks is monitored when stock status problems are perceptible at the SMU level.
- · When faced with stock-status problems, provisions linking population status with management of SMUs are enacted. Generally, population-specific reference points have not replaced SMU reference points; however, the team can adapt HCRs to account for component population status.
- · Differential harvest; for example, altering the time, location, or effort of the fishery.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.4.2 ▲

Proven management strategies designed to control exploitation rates on wild stocks include:

- · Differential harvest of artificially produced fish at higher rates than wild fish.
- · Ensuring wild harvest rates are consistent with meeting SMU TRPs (escapement goals) for wild fish. This would include fish produced from spawning channels, which even if not marked, could be subject to time and area management strategies to achieve differential harvest rates.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.5 HCRs and tools PI (PI 1.2.2) ▲

As a result of the stock structure of salmon, there will likely be a distribution of impacts across populations.

The team should consider this in terms of:

- · The population's natural productivity.
- · The differential harvesting from each population.

This may vary over time as a result of changes in natural processes, fishery activities, or fishery management.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.5.2 ▲

It may not be possible to distinguish component populations while the fishery is operating or to regulate catches of specific populations. If so, the team should evaluate whether fishery managers attempt to use differential harvest and selection pressure on fish with different life-history traits, such as return timing and size/age at return, which may vary among component populations, in order to minimise impact on any one life history.

Further considerations may include:

- · Demonstrated understanding that underlying component population structure exists and needs to be conserved within the SMU.
- · The range in productivity levels of different component populations.
- · Expected variability in environmental conditions that could differentially affect population capacity and productivity.

- · Expected variability in meeting SMU goals because of natural variation in catchability of fish, noncompliance with regulations by fishing vessels, and management error.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.6 Information and monitoring PI (PI 1.2.3) ▲

In this PI, the team should consider whether the information collected supports the harvest strategy at the SMU level while also maintaining individual component populations.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - comprehensive range of information ▲

'Comprehensive range' of information in SG100 can include information on:

- · SMU structure.
- · SMU production.
- · Fleet composition.
- · SMU abundance.
- · UoA removals.
- · Estimates of the impacts of fishery harvest on the SMU and the majority of wild component populations.
- · The environment.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.6.1 ▲

Examples of 'sufficient relevant information' (SG80) include:

- · Evidence that the abundance of wild component populations has been maintained at levels and spatial distributions that show persistence of the populations, as described from aerial and other index survey counts of spawners.
- · Evidence that the management strategy has incorporated approaches that minimise fishery impacts on weak wild populations, for example:
- o Time/area closures to minimise harvests of weak populations, and/or
- o Targeting and achieving the upper end of the TRP escapement range for the SMU as a means to maintain populations with lower productivity.
- · Explicit trade-off and risk analyses, such as that conducted for the Skeena River Independent Science Review 102 , which considers how the current definition of SMU reference points and management strategies, combined with possible variability in status and productivity of individual stock components, affects the status of individual populations.

A 'comprehensive range' (SG100) of information would include more rigorous analyses, for instance in addition to the above, stochastic simulations/risk analyses that also explicitly take into account observation error and uncertainty reflected by deviations between management targets and final endof-season outcomes. An example of such analyses is the HCR recently developed for Fraser River,

British Columbia sockeye salmon 103 . The study explores alternative HCR/guidelines that can respond to decreases in productivity.

## GSC2.7 Assessment of stock status PI (PI 1.2.4) ▲

When assessing stock status, the team should consider reference points. Reference points in salmon fisheries often differ from those of wholly marine species.

While these reference points may not be expressed in terms of MSY or PRI, the intent should be consistent with Box GSA3 in guidance for the default tree.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - assessment approach ▲

In this scoring issue, reference points in salmon fisheries may take several forms.

TRPs are required to be consistent with MSY, or a proxy that reflects equal or lower risks to one or more component populations.

Examples of these are biological escapement goals (BEGs) or spawner abundance required to achieve MSY (SMSY). Where such quantitative reference points cannot be defined, the following guidance allows for proxies provided they are consistent with maintaining high production:

- · TRPs may be expressed as escapement goals, target harvest rates, or fishing mortality targets:
- o The goals may take the form of BEGs, management escapement goals (MEGs), and sustainable escapement goals (SEGs), along with conservation unit benchmarks, etc.
- o The goals can be calculated using a variety of methods; for example, Ricker spawner recruit analysis, yield analysis, spawning habitat capacity, or sustained yield analysis.
- o TRPs may be single points or ranges.
- o Any method of analysis is acceptable as long as the goal is maintaining high production or achieving a high probability of maintaining a substantial population over the long term; for example, a population that is &gt; BMSY over the long term. See examples in Table GSC2.
- · LRPs are only sometimes explicitly defined in salmon fisheries and may take the form of minimum stock size threshold, Sgen, or others as defined by management. See examples in Table GSC2.

Where an LRP is not defined, a default LRP should be an escapement of at least 50% of the SMSY escapement goal, or some other proxy of high abundance as described in above 104 .

For escapement goals expressed as ranges , the team should consider:

- · Whether the range is quantitatively derived.
- · The logic by which the range was established.

The team should determine whether:

- · The range will maintain the population around SMSY.
- · The default LRP is more appropriately defined as:

- o 50% of the lower bound of the range.
- o 50% of the midpoint of the range.

Table GSC2 shows example target and LRPs for salmon fisheries in selected jurisdictions. This list is not all-inclusive. The team may use other reference points if they are consistent with an annual percent harvest rate that achieves MSY or SMSY.

## Scoring issue (f) - stocks with lower productivity ▲

At SG80 and SG100, stocks with lower productivity are those with a higher conservation risk.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (g) - definition of stock management units ▲

In this scoring issue, the team should consider the following at SG60 :

- · Knowledge of the physical habitat, such as lakes and rivers, and the wild populations that inhabit them.
- · A rationale for choosing those populations as the basis for an SMU, taking into account the objective of maintaining diversity and productivity of component populations.

Additional information is expected at SG80, including:

- · Identification and description of wild populations.
- · Description of which wild populations have management goals.
- · Description of which wild populations are monitored.
- · Rationale for the choice of wild populations having goals and monitoring, based on their representativeness of the complete range of productivity and diversity amongst populations in the SMU.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.7.1 ▲

The team should assess the adequacy of SMU reference points for SMUs with higher numbers of populations, which are characterised by substantial population diversity and varying productivities, as compared to simpler and more homogeneous SMUs.

- · If the SMU is composed of a single population, the concepts of single-stock management apply, and the reference points of the SMU should apply to the population.

- · If the SMU is composed of multiple populations, the team may define establishment of reference points as an aggregate for the components. However, the team should verify that aggregate reference points and management strategies for the SMU ensure that the wild production components are maintained at a level that ensures a high probability of their persistence over time.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.7.1.1 ▲

For salmon fisheries that are influenced by artificial production, the team should:

- · Base reference points only on natural-origin, wild fish.
- · When evaluating reference points, consider the potential for artificially produced fish to confound evaluation.
- · Consider the relative abundance of artificially produced versus wild salmon (both presence and abundance of artificially produced fish in the fishery and on the spawning grounds).

The intent of management should be to maintain high production of the wild SMU and productivity of component populations to the extent that the natural environment will allow.

## GSC2.7.2 ▲

Within a watershed, geographic proximity and habitat type are predictors of correlations in abundance of component populations 105 .

Therefore, indicator populations should:

- · Be distributed geographically throughout the SMU.
- · Contain representative numbers of various spawning habitat types found within the watershed.

In assessing coherence and correlation, the CAB should interpret:

- · ' Some evidence of coherence ' at the SG80 level to be a mean pairwise correlation of at least 0.4.
- · ' Well correlated ' at the SG100 level to be a mean pairwise correlation of at least 0.6 or by similar means that determine the same level of certainty.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.7.3 ▲

A well-defined SMU is one that managers can influence directly through management actions and harvest controls, which implies an understanding of how changes to harvest patterns impact escapement.

As an SMU is typically defined to aggregate populations for the purpose of defining a management objective for practical fishery decision-making, inclusion of populations within an SMU should be based on sharing, to some extent, similar characteristics such as:

- · Run timing.
- · Common region of origin.

- · Genetic characteristics.
- · Coastal migration patterns (exposure to interception fisheries).
- · Population productivities.
- · Exposure to environmental conditions that affect annual survival rates.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.7.3.1 ▲

Enhancement increases the chance of overharvesting the less-abundant and/or less-productive salmon stocks that migrate through fishing areas at the same time as the artificially produced fish.

The team should assess whether wild and artificially influenced components are clearly distinguished:

- · In defining SMUs.
- · When evaluating their adequacy to support establishment of reference points and management strategies.

In the special case of side-channel enhancement facilities, in order to estimate SMU status, it is important to identify the overall channel and wild stock contributions to catch and escapement. The team can assess these contributions in a number of ways:

- · Using run-reconstruction techniques; for example, back calculating relative contributions of component populations at various prior times and areas based on relative spawning escapement abundances.
- · By periodic evaluation of juveniles produced from the channels in relation to the number of adults spawning.
- · In some cases, depending on the population differences within a river system, by estimating the contribution of spawning channel fish by use of genetic stock-identification techniques.
- · By considering how similar the channel environmental conditions are relative to the natural environmental conditions; for example, by looking at flow, temperature, complexity, competitors, and predators.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.9 Enhancement outcomes PI (PI 1.3.1) ▲

Potential negative impacts may include:

- · Outbreeding depression due to translocation of dissimilar brood stock into locally adapted populations.
- · Inbreeding depression or loss of native genetic diversity due to directed or inadvertent hatchery selection or domestication.
- · Excessive impact on wild fish for hatchery broodstock.
- · Reduced natural juvenile survival due to predation, competition, and other ecological interactions.
- · Increased natural adult pre-spawn mortality due to handling and migration delays resulting from effects of weirs.
- · Changes in spawning distribution due to weir effects resulting in reduced reproductive success.
- · Increased prevalence and impacts of disease.
- · Reduction in smolts per spawner due to increased density-dependent effects.

The risks of these impacts, including probabilities as well as magnitudes of various negative effects, are a function of:

- · Adult broodstock collection sources and their level of influence from natural populations.
- · Hatchery mating, incubation, and rearing practices.
- · Juvenile release numbers, life stage at release, size, acclimation, and geographical distribution.
- · Straying of returning adults: hatchery fish to natural spawning grounds and natural-origin fish used for hatchery broodstock.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - enhancement impacts ▲

In scoring issue (a), the CAB may consider the following situations:

- · In systems subject to low levels of artificial production, the comprehensiveness of the studies required for the team to judge that outcomes are likely being met can be considerably less than in cases with substantial artificial production programmes. Low-level systems of artificial production will be characterised by the following, although this not an exhaustive list:
- o The proportion of hatchery releases or production of juveniles from artificial habitat compared to total artificially produced and wild production in a unit of certification is relatively small, &lt; 10%.
- o The management system has implemented measures and strategies that are known to be effective at limiting the level and spatial extent of straying.
- o Unique wild populations are unlikely to interact with hatchery fish spawning naturally.
- · Recovery hatchery programs are artificial production programs designed for the specific conservation purpose of preventing the extirpation of severely depressed populations. These are generally subject to more stringent design characteristics and performance benchmarks than other hatchery programs. The goal of a recovery hatchery is typically to increase the number of naturally spawning adults in the population. Consequently, the standard default assumptions (Box GSC1 below) do not apply. Recovery hatchery programs:
- o Are implemented only after targeted commercial fishing on the population has been eliminated or severely restricted.
- o Are temporary.
- o Are intended to supplement depressed natural populations or provide fish for artificial recolonisation of streams that have experienced local or brood-year extinctions, to maintain

genetic diversity within and among stocks, and to conserve valuable or rare genes and genotypes.

- o May, or may not, rely on captive broodstock to accomplish these goals.
- o Attempt to minimise or eliminate negative effects common to fish culture, resulting in as close to wild fish as possible. Primary success criteria are:
- a. Increased abundance of spawners and/or outmigrants.
- b. Increased abundance of natural origin spawners.
- c. Maintained or increased long-term fitness: productivity and life history.
- d. Lowered chance of extinction.
- e. Recolonisation of a self-sustaining population.
- f. Brood-year reconstruction, while avoiding negative hatchery impacts as much as possible.
- · Spawning channels differ from hatchery programs but the team should score them in a similar way.

In these systems, the entire natural reproduction life cycle occurs in a natural habitat, with the main artificial production interventions being enhanced spawning gravel habitat and controlled channel flows. Once fish enter the spawning channel, all reproduction processes, such as mate selection, redd building, incubation, and any rearing, occur without human intervention.

Because the consequences of straying of adult returns would typically not present the same concerns as hatcheries, the team should not assess the potential impacts of spawning channels according to Box GSC1 if the channel:

- · Is isolated from other spawning populations genetically dissimilar to the population being enhanced in the spawning channel, or
- · Exactly or very closely mimics the natural environment.

However, when assessing the likelihood that the spawning channel operation could be having a significant impact on genetic and life-history diversity of wild populations, the team should consider the size of the programme and similarity with nearby populations, based on expected straying distances.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.9.1.1 ▲

'Relevant studies' may include, but are not limited to:

- · Studies on the same species as the UoA.
- · Studies in the same or similar geographic area.
- · Studies in the same or similar habitat.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.9.1.2 ▲

Box GSC1 presents default acceptable impact guidelines for artificial production.

The guidance in Box GSC1 establishes default criteria for evaluating whether the proportions of pHOS and of wild populations/spawning areas being affected by artificial production are 'likely' to have significant negative impacts on wild stocks. If other system-specific benchmarks have been adopted by the fishery management system, the team should evaluate their appropriateness in delivering similar levels of performance to those in Box GSC1.

Box GSC1 was developed from specific 'best practice' considerations and science developed from fitness modelling and empirical studies of yearling smolts released from riverine species such as Chinook, coho, and steelhead hatcheries 106 .

Specific studies on chum and pink salmon are rare, but the Recovery Implementation Science Team 107  concluded that hatchery strategies that involve release of fish at earlier life stages probably lead to smaller genetic changes than strategies that involve release of fish at later life stages. It may therefore be reasonable to modify pHOS criteria for pink and chum salmon because their hatchery rearing is the shortest. While the magnitude of relaxation will be situation-specific, the team should provide rationale to support its decisions.

If the CAB considers additional evidence from species-specific studies to be more relevant to a specific situation, it should provide justification for having adjusted the default impact guidelines.

Box GSC1: Default acceptable impact guidelines for artificial production

The intent of this guidance is to help ensure that the majority of genetic diversity and productive capacity of the SMU is protected from the risks of enhancement activities in freshwater production areas. The guidelines below are primarily derived from studies on Chinook, coho, sockeye, and steelhead. The team may relax impact guidelines from these levels for pink and chum with sufficient justification (see above).

## For SG60

- · Regardless of hatchery production strategy, pHOS at the level of the population should be negligible (&lt; 1%) in more than 50% of populations, and these populations should be representative of the productivity and genetic diversity of populations within an SMU.
- · pHOS at the level of the SMU should be:
- o No more than 10% for segregated hatchery programs. Individual population pHOS values above 10% would be expected to occur only in areas in closer proximity to hatchery facilities, where values might be affected by smaller wild spawning populations that are not important potential contributors to the wild diversity or productive capacity of the SMU.
- o No more than 33% for integrated hatchery programs.
- · The level of enhancement in the remaining populations is unspecified at SG60.

## For SG80

Further pHOS at the level of the SMU should be:

- · For segregated hatchery programs:
- o No more than 5%.
- · For integrated hatchery programs:

- o No more than 10% for programs where pNOB is &lt; 20%.

The limits for integrated hatchery programs are presented graphically in Figure GSC2.

Figure GSC2 depicts the maximum allowable average pHOS within an SMU at SG80, in relation to the pNOB. These guidelines are based primarily on studies of riverine species such as Chinook, coho, and steelhead. The team may modify these guidelines for pink and chum salmon, and for other species, with sufficient reasoned justification.

Figure GSC2: Maximum allowable pHOS for overall SMU at SG80

<!-- image -->

## At the SG100 level

pHOS should be &lt; 1% in all populations in an SMU.

## Further guidance in application of Box GSC1:

- · If there are both segregated and integrated hatchery fish spawning naturally within the SMU, the team should consider the limits above in its assessment.
- · If there are hatchery-origin spawners on the spawning grounds of the SMU under assessment that originate from outside this SMU, the team should assess them using the segregated criteria limits above. Strays from outside the SMU present a greater genetic risk than those originating within the SMU and are therefore only permitted at lower limits.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.9.1.3 ▲

If there are no scientific studies available and no information or estimates of pHOS or pNOB, the team should carefully consider the potential impact based on:

- · The magnitude of hatchery origin fish released, or
- · The percentage of hatchery fish in the harvest of the SMU.

Scoring should be precautionary. The team should provide sufficient justification as to why the magnitude or percentage of hatchery fish is 'likely' to have a small impact with minimal hatchery origin fish reaching the spawning grounds (i.e. a small pHOS). The team might consider:

- · Whether the hatchery type is an integrated or segregated hatchery program.
- · Whether there is differential harvesting to avoid hatchery fish appearing on the spawning grounds.
- · The location of the hatchery.
- · The release site.
- · Where the fish are eventually harvested.
- · Whether the management agency removes hatchery fish prior to accessing the spawning grounds.

## GSC2.10 Enhancement management PI (PI 1.3.2)

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - management strategy in place ▲

To achieve the SG80 outcome, the team should reasonably expect the management system to design and manage its hatchery-program outcomes with an understanding of:

- · The wild population structure.
- · Characteristics that its hatchery programs could be expected to affect.

The management system should also develop basic hatchery management objectives with respect to limits on impacts within this context. The team should consider:

- · Identification and description of populations within the SMU.
- · The level and spatial distribution of genetic and life-history diversity; for example, run timing, spawning timing, age structure, juvenile life-history forms, and other unique phenotypic traits.
- · Populations with unique characteristics.
- · The relative abundance of wild populations: magnitude and spatial distribution.
- · Expected spatial distribution and magnitude of natural spawning of hatchery returns in relation to wild population abundance and diversity.
- · Objectives/Intent for limiting the magnitude and spatial distribution of pHOS consistent with protecting the diversity and productive capacity of the SMU and its component wild populations.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.10.1 ▲

The team should expect the use and evaluation of proven artificial production and harvest management strategies to help minimise the numbers and proportions of hatchery fish interbreeding with wild fish in natural spawning areas. Common examples typically include:

- · Siting of hatchery facilities in areas that are isolated from areas of high wild salmon abundance and diversity for the species being produced.
- · Ensuring release at sites and with strategies that are likely to maximise imprinting and homing.

- · Identifying high-value watersheds where hatcheries are not used.
- · Fishing strategies that result in differential harvest rates between hatchery and wild fish to limit straying and ensure sustainable wild harvest rates.
- · Marking hatchery fish releases so that the distribution and composition of hatchery and wild fish can be monitored in fisheries, spawning grounds, and in hatchery broodstock.
- · Active exclusion of marked hatchery fish from spawning in the wild through management of passage through weirs.
- · Scaling hatchery release numbers to a level that is consistent with not exceeding hatchery stray benchmarks in concert with other strategies.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.11 Enhancement information PI (PI 1.3.3) ▲

Marking and monitoring programs will be particularly relevant to evaluations of sufficiency for this indicator. The team should expect that important information, such as the amount of fry emigrating from these habitats, is monitored annually to help gauge the potential impact on wild populations.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (a) - information adequacy ▲

- · For SG60, the team should interpret 'some relevant information' to mean that some artificially produced fish carry recognisable marks, such as fin clips, coded-wire tags, otolith marks, parent-based tagging (PBT), or thermal marks. These should enable the team to make approximate estimates of contributions of hatchery salmon to harvests, hatchery broodstocks, and spawning populations.
- o It is reasonable to expect these contribution estimates are being made or can be reasonably inferred from an understanding of the dynamics of the fishery and enhancement programs, including from an existing understanding of size, location, and general release-to-adult contribution rates.
- · For SG80, the team should interpret 'sufficient relevant qualitative and quantitative information' to mean a large representative fraction of artificially produced fish-carry recognisable marks, such as fin clips, coded-wire tags, otolith marks, PBT, or thermal marks, to accurately estimate contributions of hatchery salmon to harvests, hatchery broodstocks, spawning populations, and escapes. For large hatchery programs this may be up to 100%.
- o It is reasonable to expect that these estimates are currently being made via data collected through associated harvest, hatchery, and escapement monitoring programs at a level of precision and accuracy necessary to support the harvest management strategy. As the levels of hatchery-origin spawners approach the limits stated in Box GSC1, the necessary sampling frequency increases to achieve the required accuracy of estimates of pHOS. The team should supplement direct estimates with other analytical methods.
- · For SG100, the team should interpret 'comprehensive range of relevant quantitative information' to mean that all artificially produced fish, regardless of program size, carry marks, such as fin clips, coded-wire tags, otolith marks, PBT, or thermal marks, allowing highly accurate and precise estimates of hatchery salmon to harvests, hatchery broodstocks, spawning populations, and escapes.
- o It is reasonable to expect that these estimates of hatchery and wild contributions are currently made through associated harvest, hatchery, and escapement monitoring programs, at a scale and intensity of temporal and spatial coverage that provides comprehensive information and understanding.
- · 'Total escapement' in SG60, SG80, and SG100 should be interpreted to mean both wild and enhanced.

<!-- image -->

The team should expect artificially produced fish to be marked and monitored in catch and escapement, in sufficient quantities to enable the fishery to define TRPs for wild salmon populations and SMUs, implement harvest strategies, and evaluate levels of interaction between hatchery and wild fish on spawning grounds. Requirement of this information is implicit within the evaluation of stock status and reference points, which do not include artificially produced salmon.

Only enhancement information should be explicitly scored in this PI.

<!-- image -->

## GSC2.11.2 ▲

The marking requirements described above do not routinely apply to fish produced from artificial spawning channels, because:

- · The monitoring and information tools available for hatcheries are not available for spawning channels.
- · The absence of confined hatchery methods for incubation and rearing within a spawning channel limits the practical marking tools available.

However, where there is an increased likelihood of interactions between spawning channel strays and dissimilar wild populations in areas of potential interaction, the team should expect that the management system would assess those risks via:

- · Visual marking of juveniles at emigration from the weir, or
- · Genetic marking techniques.

The need for such information and monitoring would be greater where:

- · The conditions of spawning channels differ greatly from the natural environment, or
- · The magnitude of adult production originating from the spawning channel exceeds the natural production of wild populations with which the spawning channel fish might interact.

## Scoring issue (c) - impacts due to enhancement activities within the UoA ▲

In this scoring issue, the team should consider the following as examples to demonstrate that hatchery facilities are ' highly unlikely' to have adverse impacts at the SG80 level :

- · Facility design, construction, and operations limit effects on the riparian corridor and are consistent with fluvial geomorphology principles; for example, they avoid bank erosion or undesired channel modification.
- · Water withdrawals and in-stream water diversion structures for artificial production facility operation do not:
- o Prevent access to natural spawning areas.
- o Affect spawning behaviour of natural populations.
- o Impact the juvenile-rearing environment.

For example, in stream flows between diversion and discharge return points, as well as further -flow impacts downstream, are not significantly diminished.

- · Effluents from artificial production facilities conform with accepted or required levels that do not detrimentally affect natural populations.
- · Weir/trap operations used to collect hatchery broodstock do not:

- o Prevent access to natural spawning areas.
- o Affect spawning behaviour or success of wild fish.
- o Result in significant stress, injury, or mortality in natural spawners.
- · A record of compliance with applicable environmental laws that are designed to protect natural populations and habitats from potential adverse impacts of artificial production program operation.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.13.1.c ▲

For example, physical features, spawning and rearing flows, and water temperatures.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.13.2.1 ▲

Habitat modifications due to salmon enhancement activities can include:

- · Physical changes to the river course, such as spawning channels.
- · Changes to water quality due to hatchery discharge.
- · The use of a range of man-made structures associated with the rearing habitat.

Examples of adverse impacts include:

- · Delay in reaching spawning grounds that reduces spawning success.
- · Blockage of access to spawning habitat from weirs used for hatchery broodstock collection.
- · Dewatering of downstream water channels used for spawning and rearing.
- · Increased water temperature from human activities that increases fish mortality rate.
- · Improper screening of water-intake systems that cause mortality or entrainment of wild fish.
- · Discharge of effluents or pollutants contrary to water quality standards.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.14 Habitats management strategy PI (PI 2.3.2) ▲

Enhancement facilities typically operate under a wide set of environmental regulations and review requirements with respect to their potential impacts on aquatic habitat, such as:

- · Use of drugs.
- · Fish-passage requirements.
- · Water-discharge permits.
- · Water-withdrawal authorisation.

The team should examine evidence to determine whether these requirements are in place and are being met as part of the overall strategy for meeting the habitat status outcome.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - management strategy effectiveness ▲

For scoring issue (b) at the SG60 level, some examples of 'plausible argument' are general experience, theory, or comparison with similar UoAs or habitats.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.14.1 ▲

Physical features, spawning and rearing flows, and water temperatures can be affected by enhancement activities.

The team should expect to see management strategies that seek to meet the typical outcomes in GSC3.13.

Examples of such strategies could include:

- · Facility design or maintenance plans and construction permit applications that specifically consider and avoid known impacts.
- · Routine, regular inspections; maintenance and assessment activities of physical parameters such as flows, screen, and weir operations; and a record of taking actions in response to these activities.
- · Implementation of withdrawal permit operating requirements. Or, if the system does not operate under a formal permitting system, similar operating criteria are being applied.
- · Implementation of regular fish-passage procedures based on explicit hatchery objectives, which pass naturally spawning fish above any hatchery weir and sustain natural production consistent with available habitat capacity.
- · Implementation of fish-handling protocol, and staff provided with associated training/guidelines; for example, to ensure that captured adult wild fish are not injured and that upstream migration delays are minimised.
- · Active implementation and maintenance of water quality management strategies to meet effluent discharge requirements.

Annual or periodic reports that demonstrate review and mitigation actions for any such impacts can be used to confirm that these strategies are being utilised.

Enhanced salmon fishery interventions may also include:

- · Lake fertilisation to enhance natural food production.
- · Removal of predators or competitors to maximise early-stage salmon survival.

The team should evaluate these impacts as per PI 2.4.1.

## GSC3.15 Habitats information PI (PI 2.3.3)

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.15.1 ▲

The team may expect information on enhancement activities to include:

- · The proportion of diversion of total stream flow between intake and outfall water.
- · Withdrawals compared to applicable passage criteria and to juvenile-screening criteria.
- · Discharge water quality monitoring data required by, or equivalent to, any environmental permit provisions.
- · Water flow and temperature data above the hatchery intake and below the discharge.
- · Logs of periodic inspection above any hatchery weirs to ensure the passage of fish upstream is not being impeded.
- · The number of adult fish aggregating and/or spawning immediately below water-intake points, compared to the number of adult fish passing water intake points.
- · Records of any fish mortalities or injuries of fish or other aquatic resources in the hatchery weir/traps, and in the natural habitat near or within a zone of influence of the hatchery.

## GSC3.16 Ecosystem outcome PI (PI 2.4.1)

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - impacts due to enhancement ▲

In this scoring issue, the team should consider:

- · The scale and size of the programs being assessed as part of creating a general risk framework.
- · Objective evidence for negative interactions, or lack of negative interactions.

In this context, the team may consider the magnitude of releases and returns of artificially produced fish in the area being assessed, compared to the wild production from the same area.

If artificially produced fish constitute a significant proportion of either juveniles or returning adults to an area, the team should require a higher level of evidence to make a judgment about likelihood, taking into account:

- · The likelihood that hatchery releases coincide in space and time with the presence of juvenile wild salmon.
- · The level of total species production in the UoA compared to historic levels.
- · Potential changes in current habitat conditions and natural reproduction capacity compared to historic levels.
- · Indicators of any density-dependent processes that could potentially be related to the enhancement program, because they are known to overlap in space and time with species or stocks that are exhibiting demonstrated changes in population dynamics.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.16.1 ▲

The team should consider interactions at any life stage in both freshwater and marine habitats.

The team should consider the ecosystem impacts of enhancement activities across the entire geographic range of the salmon populations.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.16.2 ▲

Disease transmission and predation/competition are issues requiring very different levels of active management and information, monitoring and compliance requirements, and capacities.

The team should assess the degree of likelihood that enhancement activities have minimal negative effect on the productive capacity of wild salmon and other aquatic populations as a result of predation and competition for resources, such as prey or spawning habitat.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.17 Ecosystem management PI (PI 2.4.2) ▲

Current 'best practice' for disease management in enhancement facilities involves a very rigorous monitoring and adaptive management system using well-established policies, guidelines, performance indicators, benchmarks, and procedures, which are designed to carefully protect hatchery and natural fish populations from the importation, dissemination, and amplification of fish pathogens and disease conditions.

The team should assess and verify the degree to which the hatchery management system is implementing an approved, proven protocol in a manner that ensures the likelihood of meeting these objectives and related outcome for PI 2.4.1.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (b) - 'plausible argument' ▲

Examples of 'plausible argument' used in scoring issue (b) may include general experience, theory, or comparison with similar UoAs/ecosystems.

<!-- image -->

## Scoring issue (d) - management of enhancement activities ▲

In this scoring issue, the team should focus on management of potential impacts of the release of fish from large-scale artificial production operation; in particular, the strategies for avoiding adverse competition and predation effects on the receiving ecosystems, including:

- · Inter-species and intra-species competition, both inshore and offshore.
- · Issues of carrying capacity.

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.17.1 ▲

Management measures could include practices that minimise overlap in time and space between hatchery releases and the wild component.

## Examples

Examples of strategies for minimising ecological risk include:

- · Methods to minimise disease transmission.
- · Hatchery programs scaled to fit carrying capacity of the watershed or basin.
- · Coordination with other hatcheries to limit releases at a regional scale; for example, the North Pacific, Columbia Basin, or major sub-basins.
- · Releasing only smolts that will promptly out-migrate, unless the release of other life stages is part of a specific biological objective.
- · The use of acclimation ponds and volitional releases as a means to minimise residual fish and straying of returning adults.
- · Careful timing of releases; for example, release of predatory hatchery fish after wild salmon reaches large enough sizes to avoid being consumed.
- · Careful consideration of both the timing and magnitude of releases because high concentration of hatchery fish in time and space may attract predators and may have an offsetting effect to some unknown extent by 'swamping' the predators with so much prey that the percent mortality on wild fish is also reduced.
- · Rigorous marking and monitoring of hatchery fish and adaptive management.

## GSC3.18 Ecosystem information PI (PI 2.4.3)

<!-- image -->

## GSC3.18.1 ▲

For hatchery operations, the team may use the following to enable its understanding of the impacts on the receiving ecosystem:

- · Information on environmental health conditions.
- · Culture and general health histories.
- · Information on pathogen detection collected at a relevant level of accuracy.
- · Information covering the complete artificial production cycle consistent with requirements of implementing the disease management strategy.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

- · Information on the distribution and size of artificially produced and wild fish at various life-cycle stages in freshwater and marine areas, to identify the times and areas where artificially produced fish could compete with or prey upon wild fish of the same species or with other aquatic species. These potential interactions need to be understood at a level of detail relevant to the scale and size of the enhancement programs.

## GSC4 Principle 3

## GSC4.1 General requirements for Principle 3

<!-- image -->

## GSC4.1.1 ▲

In Principle 3, the following Performance Indicators have modifications to the requirements: PI 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, and 3.2.4. PI 3.1.1 should still be scored in accordance with Section SA.

The CAB should apply:

- · All Section SA requirements.
- · All Section GSA guidance.
- · Modifications in Section SC.
- · Supplemental guidance in Section GSC.

<!-- image -->

## GSC4.1.2 ▲

This requirement is to ensure there is an institutional and operational framework for these activities, appropriate to their size and scale, for implementing the related provisions of Principles 1 and 2 capable of delivering sustainable outcomes. When undertaking this additional assessment, the team should:

- · Examine specific relevant evidence.
- · Document its consideration of this evidence relative to the scoring process.

The team may assess the size and scale of enhancement activities by considering a rough comparison of the magnitude of releases and returns of artificially produced fish in the area being assessed, compared to the wild production.

## GSC4.4 Consultation, roles, and responsibilities PI (PI 3.1.2)

<!-- image -->

## GSC4.4.1 ▲

The team should assess whether the management system has effective consultation processes that are open to stakeholders and related to aspects of both the fishery and the enhancement activities.

## GSC4.5 Long-term objectives PI (PI 3.1.3)

<!-- image -->

## GSC4.5.1 ▲

It is necessary for the salmon management agency to demonstrate that its key ecological objective for its enhancement activities is managing sustainable wild salmon populations while minimising potentially adverse effects of enhancement activities. The high-level or broad management policy context should incorporate a precautionary approach that places the burden on the enhancement programs to demonstrate that:

- · They are minimising adverse impacts identified in Principle 1 and 2 indicators.
- · This burden increases as the size of the enhancement activities, individually and cumulatively, increases.

That burden of proof will also be higher for hatcheries than for other forms of artificial production that generally have lower impacts.

## GSC4.7 Fishery-specific objectives PI (PI 3.2.1)

## GSC4.7.1 ▲

The CAB should interpret 'clear objectives' to mean that a management system with any significant level of enhancement has documented enhancement objectives and operational requirements, which are designed to minimise various impacts on natural population components and ecosystem function. These are to be contained in a clear operational plan.

## GSC4.8 Decision-making processes PI (PI 3.2.2)

<!-- image -->

## GSC4.8.1 ▲

If enhancement programs are significant, and uncertainties exist about the level of program impacts, the team should consider whether the management system is making decisions about production, measures, and strategies in a precautionary manner.

For example, the team may consider:

- · Decisions about increasing or decreasing release levels.
- · Whether measures are being implemented and evaluated that could be expected to reduce the scale and magnitude of potential interactions between wild and enhanced populations.
- · Whether monitoring and evaluation programs are being initiated and/or maintained to collect essential information to inform future decisions.

In marine fisheries, it is widely recognised internationally that an ideal way to increase the chance of meeting management objectives, improving future decision making, and increasing fairness is to conduct thorough evaluations of a wide range of management options, data collection procedures, and in some cases methods of data analysis 108 . These are done through probabilistic simulation models/risk assessments. Some such analyses, variously called management strategy evaluations 109 and closed-loop simulations 110 , have been done for Pacific salmon 2012 111 .

The most comprehensive examples of management strategy evaluations take into account:

- · Time dynamics of fish populations.
- · Dynamics of the fishery.
- · Observation error.
- · Implementation uncertainty, reflecting when regulations are followed imperfectly.
- · Other sources of uncertainty.

The outcome of such evaluations is the identification of state-dependent decision-making rules that will best meet complex management objectives in the presence of these uncertainties. For a given fishery, the state-dependent rules are identified prior to the fishing and/or enhancement-activity season and are the agreed-upon method for altering regulations based on in-season updates to the

states of the system. Those rules are not subject to in-season change based on lobbying by special interest groups.

Most decisions in salmon management involve trade-offs between long-term conservation objectives and short-term fish-harvesting objectives, and trade-offs between user groups. Learning which decisions work best for meeting such complex objectives can be facilitated by decision-makers publicly documenting the reasons for various decisions on fishing regulations and enhancement activities, and comparing the expectations against outcomes.

The team should, in its scoring, consider whether such public documentation is provided.

No modifications to Section GSA.

## GSC4.10 Monitoring and management performance evaluation PI (PI 3.2.4)

Scoring issue (b) - Internal and/or external review ▲

At SG60, information should be available internally for hatchery program performance review.

At SG80, information should be available externally and publicly to enable external scrutiny of hatchery performance.

## GSC5 Allowances for inseparable or practicably inseparable catches in salmon fisheries

## GSC5.1.2 ▲

For pink salmon, which have a 2-year life history, the team should calculate the average catch across the most recent years of each cycle line.

For longer-lived salmon species, the team should calculate average recent catches across periods appropriate to their life history in the region of the fishery.

Where different salmon species are in consideration as target and inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) species, the team should first calculate average catches based on data from the number of years appropriate to each species and then determine the percentage catches.

<!-- image -->

End of Section SC Guidance

## GSD Introduced species-based fisheries ▲

## Background

The assessment of introduced species under Principle 1 is potentially complicated because of the varying, but valid ecological objectives that can exist for fisheries that are based on introduced species.

In most introduced species-based fisheries, objectives are set to ensure optimum productivity of the target introduced species. In other fisheries, objectives may be set to keep populations of the introduced species at a level that ensures wider ecosystem objectives are met. These wider ecosystem objectives may include keeping the target stock at sub-MSY levels in order to allow for some level of restoration of biodiversity.

## GSD1 General▲

The team should not follow FCP 7.10.5 when adding an additional scoring issue and corresponding guideposts, as per SD3.1.3 and/or SD3.1.4.

## GSD2 Principle 1

## GSD2.1

General requirements for Principle 1

## GSD2.1.2 ▲

A fishery may choose to set its TRPs for the introduced species either at levels consistent with MSY, or at lower levels aimed at mitigating the impact on other species. SD2.1.2.1 requires that where TRPs are adjusted in this way, it may be appropriate to make a modification to the default tree to reflect that modification (in PI 1.1.1 scoring issue (b) and PI 1.2.2). SD2.1.2.1.a further requires that the levels should not be set below the 'PRI', because in this case, the fishery would not be able to maintain sustainable catches.

## GSD3 Principle 2

## GSD3.1

General requirements for Principle 2

## GSD3.1.2-4 ▲

SD3.1.2 requires that CABs revise PI 2.4.2 (ecosystem management) in order to be able to evaluate the efforts of the fishery to minimise the impacts of the introduced species. Additionally, SD3.1.3 requires CABs to address the collection of information important to understanding and preventing further impact of the introduced species on biodiversity. In cases where no actual measures are in place and there is no corresponding ecosystem information being collected, SD3.1.4 allows CABs to provide a rationale as to why this is the case and the additional scoring issues are not required. The team should provide a robust rationale in this situation. The team should support this rationale with scientific evidence or logical argument that no more impacts are occurring and that further impact is unlikely. The rationale should justify why measures are not necessary.

## Ecosystem stability

For introduced species that have been in place for long enough that the ecosystem has stabilised, but the new system is dramatically different from the original, SD3.1.2-4 are still relevant. The spread of the species to new areas is still a possibility, even if the ecosystem of the current area has stabilised.

End of Section SD Guidance

## GSE Principle 1 for stocks managed by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations

## GSE1 General requirements for section SE

## GSE1.1.1 ▲

Section SE applies to stocks managed by the following RFMOs 112 :

- · CCAMLR: Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
- · CCSBT: Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
- · GFCM: General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.
- · IATTC: Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.
- · ICCAT: International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
- · IOTC: Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.
- · IPHC: International Pacific Halibut Commission.
- · NAFO: Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization.
- · NEAFC: North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.
- · NPFC: North Pacific Fisheries Commission.
- · SEAFO: South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization.
- · SIOFA: South Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement.
- · SPRFMO: South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization.
- · WCPFC: Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.

The list of RFMOs above has been modified from Løbach et al. (2020) 113  and represents the relevant RFMOs recognised by the FAO at the time Section SE was developed (i.e. 2022). RFMOs that manage salmon stocks are not included in this list because salmon fisheries are scored within Section SC.

The assessment team can use Section SE on a voluntary basis to score UoAs that include P1 stocks not managed by the above RFMOs. Applying Section SE voluntarily would be particularly relevant to:

- · Multi-jurisdictional or shared stocks, or
- · Stocks managed by RFMOs that become established after the release of these requirements.

## GSE1.1.2.2 ▲

The MSC's intent is that whilst the decision would apply to UoAs and UoCs, only UoCs are responsible for deciding if to apply Section SE. Voting rights are equal regardless of proportion of catch.

## GSE1.1.3 ▲

If the target stock(s) is not managed by an RFMO but undertakes the scoring of Section SE voluntarily (SE1.1.2), evidence should come from the management agency responsible for the target stock. Evidence that the RFMO/management agency is committed to the development and adoption of a harvest strategy that includes an MP tested within an MSE framework, is a key piece of information to demonstrate the milestones within Section SE are achievable.

## GSE2 Principle 1 requirements

## GSE2.1.1 Harvest Strategy PI 1.2.1 ▲

As used in PI 1.2.1 scoring issue (b) (Table SA4) at the 100 level, 'evaluated' means quantitative management strategy evaluation as appropriate to the fishery.

For evaluating scoring issue (b) at the harvest-strategy level, the team should consider the full interactions between different components of the harvest strategy, including:

- · The HCRs.
- · Use of information.
- · Assessment of stock status.

## GSE2.2 HCRs and tools PI (PI 1.2.2) ▲

For LTL species, the TRPs and LRPs need to take into account the ecological role of the stock for the fishery to score 60 or above under PI 1.1.1A. The harvest strategy, HCRs, information requirements, and assessment need to be consistent with this distinction. When PI 1.1.1A is scored, references to PI 1.1.1 in the guidance below should interpreted as PI 1.1.1A and the objectives required therein.

There may be conceptual differences in the reference points when scoring PI 1.1.1 and PI 1.2.2. This is because fisheries may use different reference points for measuring stock status and as triggers in the HCRs 114 . For example, a fishery that uses an explicit BMSY reference point as a target for the fishery biomass may have TRPs for adjusting F at values of biomass either at BMSY, or above or below BMSY. The focus in this PI is thus on the reference points used in a fishery to trigger changes in management actions, and how they work in combination to achieve the outcomes required in PI 1.1.1.

## Scoring issue (a) - HCR design and application ▲

The team should consider the basis for plausibility and practicality of design in relation to the scale and intensity of the fishery; for example, using:

- · Empirical information.
- · Relevant science.

- · Model-based approaches, such as management procedures and management strategy evaluation.

The team should score HCRs against their ability to deliver the levels expressed in scoring issue (a).

- · At SG 60 , HCRs should be 'likely' to ensure that stocks will be maintained above the PRI.
- · At SG 80 , HCRs should also ensure that the stock is 'likely' to fluctuate around a BMSY level. Testing may show that this is achieved by the inclusion of a BMSY consistent reference point as a trigger in the HCRs, such as an inflection in a 'hockey stick' form, at a point that would deliver BMSY in the long term.
- · At SG 100 , greater certainty is required. The team should regard fisheries with HCRs that target stock levels above BMSY, for example BMEY, as at least meeting the 80 level. Projections in the fishery may show that the HCR would 'likely' achieve the higher SG100 score by fluctuating more above than around BMSY.

HCRs will usually include some form of dynamic rule, requiring that a change of some sort will be made in response to a fishery indicator moving above or below one of the TRPs. In lightly exploited fisheries, it may be that some reference points are set to trigger changes in data collection or assessment approaches, as certain thresholds are reached 115 .

HCRs are often applied on a frequent basis, such as with the annual setting of TAC or effort restrictions.

- · Such HCRs respond dynamically to the monitoring data from the fishery with regular adjustments to input/output type management measures.
- · In data-poor fisheries that are managed without such input/output controls, management may comprise only technical measures such as size limits, gear restrictions, closed seasons, and closed areas.
- o In these cases, the specific terms of the technical measures are usually set and fixed for a relatively long period of time (several years), based on occasional strategic stock assessments that are shown to deliver defined TRPs or LRPs.
- o The team may regard such an arrangement as equivalent to a dynamic HCR operating over a longer time scale in cases where some indicators are monitored to confirm that the HCRs are delivering the intended targets for the stock.
- · For 'highly productive' species, the design of the HCR should consider life history, as this can affect performance of the control rule 116 . Given the propensity for changes in productivity with these species, adaptive and responsive control rules are key to assist with detecting and responding to changes in biomass 117 .

At SG80 in scoring issue (a), the team should expect 'well-defined' HCRs to explicitly include the conditions under which the technical measures in the fishery would be expected to be revised in the future.

## Example

Relatively sedentary bivalves often have fishery management trigger points based on population densities collected through systematic surveys, where these index densities are established based on the species population dynamics and the inherent productivity of the habitat and environmental conditions.

There may be no formal stock assessment, but yield is calculated on a proportion of the observed biomass, and the harvested fraction determined on empirical evidence from historical catches and their consequences.

The team should note that, while such arrangements can work, HCRs based on taking a constant percentage of the year's estimated biomass should not be regarded as meeting the requirement of avoiding the PRI unless some lower threshold is defined.

The CAB should not always interpret the requirement that an HCR reduces exploitation rates as the LRP is approached as requiring the control rule to deliver an exploitation rate that is a monotonically decreasing function of stock size:

- · Any exploitation rate function may be acceptable if it acts to keep the stock above an LRP that avoids possible recruitment failure and attempts to maintain the stock at a TRP that is consistent with BMSY or a similar 'highly productive' level.
- · This outcome includes the requirement that the HCR should act to cause stocks to rebuild to the TRP when they are below it. Maintenance of a stock at a level just above the LRP would not be acceptable.
- · A reduction of exploitation rate may not always mean that the control rule requires a reduction in 'total' exploitation rate, but instead could involve reducing exploitation rate on parts of the stock; for example, by age or sex.
- · The team should assume that reductions in exploitation rate refer primarily to reductions in catches and effort, and not to gear modifications unless these have the effect of reducing catches/effort.

As noted in the guidance on PI 1.1.1, HCRs may include both explicit and implicit reference points.

## Example

If a management strategy is based solely around a TRP, the HCR, when combined with TRP, should ensure that the stock remains well above the PRI. This should ensure that the exploitation rate is reduced as this point is approached. This is an implied LRP.

Equally, a management strategy based solely around an LRP should imply that there is a TRP close to or at BMSY, or some other measure or surrogate that maintains the stock at high productivity, and at a level that is well above the LRP.

## GSE2.2.2 'Generally understood' HCRs at SG60 vs 'well-defined' HCRs at SG80 ▲

For 'generally understood' and in-place HCRs, there should be at least some implicit agreement supported by past management actions that demonstrates that 'generally understood' rules exist. There should be the expectation that management will continue to follow such 'generally understood' rules in future and act when changes in explicit or implicit reference points are identified.

When determining whether a 'generally understood' HCR is in place in the fishery under assessment, the team needs to determine whether the fishery will in future take appropriate management action in line with what they perceive as the 'generally understood' rule. The team should consider evidence of positive action being taken in the past as evidence that there is a 'generally understood' rule in place. The team should provide clear reference to documents or other evidence that actions were taken on specific dates.

The team should provide evidence and examples of the positive actions taken in response to 'generally understood' HCRs for the target stock, in the case that 'generally understood' HCRs are 'in place' or for other stocks in the case that they are 'available'.

The team should apply a precautionary approach to scoring when there is uncertainty over whether an HCR meets the requirements of 'generally understood' and whether there is sufficient evidence to support this. Note, the full definition for HCRs in the MSC-MSCI Vocabulary should only apply at the SG80 level, given the term 'well-defined' is used in this definition.

The team should not consider the following as evidence that an HCR is in place:

- · A poorly defined commitment such as 'we agree to implement an HCR sometime in the future'.
- · General regulations, such as convention texts or references to the Fish Stocks Agreement.
- · However, binding commitments such as those in national law may be used as evidence, if supported by evidence of management action.
- o Scientific recommendations on HCRs or reference points that have not yet been adopted by the actual management agency.

The team should not expect that 'in place' arrangements require formal indefinite binding agreement. For example, CMMs approved by RFMO Commissions are regarded as 'active' resolutions and may thus be accepted as in place even though they may be overturned in the future.

## Scoring issue (b) - scoring uncertainty in the HCRs ▲

The SGs reflect the degree of confidence there is in the HCR performance in relation to risks caused by known and unknown factors.

Known factors include:

- · Observation and process errors that are often accounted for in stock assessments.

Unknown factors include:

- · Unpredictable effects from climate.
- · Environmental or anthropogenic non-fishery related factors, which could, for example, lead to periods of low recruitment or growth.
- · High natural mortality.
- · Migration.

These and other changes to the population dynamics may not have been fully accounted for in the stock assessment or projections. Another important reason for limited confidence in an HCR is that it has not been fully agreed by stakeholders, and it is uncertain whether the fishing community will comply with the HCR. This last issue is important to ensure HCRs are not only theoretical rules on paper but are applied in practice.

The team can use testing to support the requirement that the control rules and/or management actions are designed to take into account uncertainty. Testing can include:

- · The use of experience from analogous fisheries.
- · Empirical testing; for example, practical experience of performance or evidence of past performance.
- · Simulation testing; for instance, using computer-intensive modelling such as management strategy evaluation.

It may generally be the case that limit reference points are set at the point that reproductive capacity starts to be appreciably impaired, for some fisheries, especially those for small pelagic species and annual species where the stock recruit relationship is very steep. However, management may choose to set a limit reference point above this level. Maintaining a buffer can allow for adaptability to

changes in production 118 . Where this results in more precautionary management, it may assist the fishery in meeting SG80 or SG100 for scoring issue (b).

HCRs in small-scale fisheries may still achieve high scores if uncertainties are well considered. The team may thus score simple HCRs linked to reliable indices of stock status highly on this issue without management strategy evaluations.

## PI 1.2.2 scoring issue (c) - Evaluating the effectiveness of HCRs ▲

For Section SE, scoring can consider the overall history of effectiveness of the tools used in the fishery prior to the implementation of the harvest strategy that was 'designed'. At SG80, the team should also assess the effectiveness of the implemented HCR within the 'designed' harvest strategy (see SE3), in terms of:

- · The likelihood of achieving the desired exploitation rates and biomass levels.
- · The current status.

If under scoring issue (a) the 'available' language is used, effectiveness should be assessed in terms of the HCR applied to the other U

oA. If F &lt; FMSY is demonstrated in the other fishery, this is not sufficient evidence on its own that HCRs and tools are effective in that other fishery. Additional explanation is needed of how F &lt; FMSY has been achieved.

In this scoring issue, the team is required review the ability of the tools associated with the HCRs to achieve the exploitation levels. Such tools include:

- · Management measures like TACs and fishing limits.
- · Arrangements for sharing TACs between participants in the fishery, including between states in shared stock fisheries.

For this examination, the team may consider the overall history of effectiveness of the tools used in the fishery, in terms of their ability to achieve the desired exploitation rates and biomass levels, and the current status.

SE2.2.7 requires that the team examine the current exploitation levels in the fishery, as part of the evidence that the HCRs are working; for example, through evidence that current F is equal to or less than FMSY. The team may also accept current F levels greater than FMSY in cases where:

- · Stock biomass is currently higher than BMSY, or
- · Stock assessment information is comprehensive, and it is appropriate to treat FMSY as a TRP (see Box GSA5.

However, the team should not use F &lt; FMSY as the sole evidence for the existence of an effective HCR. F could, for example, be lower than FMSY just because effort is currently low, even though there has been no management commitment or attempts to actually control effort at a level that would constrain F to FMSY by the HCR. However, if F has been constrained at F &lt; FMSY by the tools, the team could accept this as part of the evidence that the HCRs are being effective. Evidence for the effectiveness of an HCR should in fact require the consistent achievement of the target exploitation level, which may be well below FMSY if stocks are currently below BMSY. The team should take particular care when assessing the effectiveness of capacity limitation measures in fisheries, for example, in comparison to well-monitored effort controls and catch limits, in terms of their likely ability to meet management goals and target exploitation levels.

Little Fish, Big Impact: Managing a Crucial Link in Ocean Food Webs. Lenfest Ocean Program. Washington, DC. 108 pp.

Document: MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1 Date of publication: 22 July 2024

To avoid severe socio-economic impacts in a fishery, the team may also make allowance for the gradual adjustment of F down to appropriate levels in cases where the pace of change is limited. In these cases, projections of stock status should confirm that the expected future adjustments in F will still lead to fluctuations around MSY levels within a reasonable timescale.

If proxy indicators and reference points are used in the fishery instead of explicit estimates of F and FMSY (as allowed in SA2.2.3), the team should assign higher scores where greater confidence is provided by the proxy information, similar to the scoring of PI 1.1.1. Where higher scores are justified by the use of 2 or more proxy indicators, they should be independent of each other and expected to be proxies of the quantity of interest, such as mean fish size in the case of exploitation rates. The team should present a rationale for how the proxies conform to these principles.

As with the case of using proxies for scoring stock biomass in PI 1.1.1, it may sometimes be argued that 1 good proxy is better than 2 or more weak proxies.

## Examples: SG60, SG80, and SG100 levels

Examples of how the team may justify SG60, SG80, and SG100 in these situations:

- · At least SG60 is justified if 1 proxy indicates that 'overfishing' is not occurring.
- · At least SG80 is justified if 1 or more proxies indicate that it is 'likely' that 'overfishing' is not occurring. In this case, the extra confidence may be due to the availability of a second proxy indicator, or when a minimum 70% probability level can be assigned to the single indicator used, as compared to the SG60 level where this probability level may not be demonstrated.
- · SG100 is justified if 2 or more proxies indicate it is 'highly likely' that 'overfishing' is not occurring.

## Scoring 'available' HCRs at SG60 ▲

The team may provide a rationale under SE2.2.5.a that this could reasonably be 'expected' for the target species in cases where HCRs are currently being 'effectively' used by the same management agency on at least 1 other species of similar importance, at similar average catch levels and value.

Alternatively, the team may provide a rationale under SE2.2.5.b in cases where there is some sort of arrangement in place that clearly requires that management will put HCRs in place as and when the fishery reaches some pre-defined trigger level within the vicinity of BMSY. Such arrangements:

- · Would normally relate to lightly exploited fisheries that are still in the development stage.
- · Should be explicit in requiring action at some defined point.

Although potentially driven by information and triggers, the arrangements are different to the actual HCRs as they relate to the development of the HCRs themselves, while the HCRs define how management measures will be adjusted in response to changes in fishery status.

Any commitment that will clearly deliver an HCR before the stock declines below BMSY is sufficient. However, lack of evidence is not acceptable (for example, 'there is no evidence that the stock will be below BMSY at this point'). Positive evidence is required, otherwise the precautionary approach applies.

In cases where the stock has not yet been reduced and 'available' HCRs are scored as meeting SG60, the condition assigned to this PI may allow longer than the normal 5-year time period for delivery. While there will be advantages in designing and putting into place a 'well-defined' HCR during the certification period, it may also be acceptable to do this over a longer time period; for example, if other conditions are being delivered first. The scoring of 'available' HCRs is made on the basis that the stock remains abundant and the criteria given in SE2.4.4 are still met. As soon as these criteria are no longer met, the fishery will need to have at least 'generally understood' HCRs in place to meet SG60.

Similar to the situation with the rebuilding PI (see GSA2.3), the team should allow fisheries 1 year to put HCRs in place. The team should not fail the fishery immediately if SG60 is not met in this 1st year. If such fisheries fail to put in place either 'generally understood' or 'well defined' HCRs within 1 year, the CAB should score the fishery as not meeting the SG60 level.

Document: MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1 Date of publication: 22 July 2024

'Available' HCRs must be at least 'generally understood' in nature. If the HCRs are 'well-defined' in the other stock, there would be more confidence that they are 'available' to the fishery in assessment.

CABs should note that the references to 'other UoAs' in SE2.2.5.a and 'other named UoAs' in SE2.2.6.a is not meant to imply that such UoAs are necessarily in assessment or certified as MSC fisheries. Although this may be the case, they may also just be other species or stocks that are also managed by the same management body and considered in the assessment.

If HCRs are only regarded as 'available' in scoring issue (a), it is not possible to score more than 60 for issue (c) because the SG80 refers to the tools 'in use' in the fishery in assessment, not the tools 'in use or available'.

## Assessing informal approaches to HCRs

Within Section SE, informal approaches to HCRs are only appropriate at SG60 for scoring issue (a) and (c).

## Metapopulations

The team should address uncertainties relating to the metapopulation structure. The team should note the descriptions of different types of metapopulation in FCP G7.5.

## GSE3 Process requirements for Section SE

## GSE3.1.1 Setting conditions ▲

The condition-setting requirements in Section SE are specific to setting conditions for PI 1.2.1 and PI 1.2.2 when Section SE is applied and therefore may differ from the condition setting requirements in the FCP. Differences between Section SE and the FCP are intentional. The intent of SE 3.1.1 and SE3.1.1.1 is to ensure the CAB follows the condition-setting requirements under Section SE rather than the condition-setting requirements in the FCP.

<!-- image -->

## GSE3.2.4 &amp; GSE3.3.5 Milestones ▲

The following guidance relates to the milestones that are outlined in both SE3.2.4 and SE3.3.5, noting that SE3.3.5 does not have the milestones occurring across two phases.

Within the first milestone , the management objectives should:

- · Outline what the harvest strategy is aiming to achieve.
- · Reflect the achievement of SG80 in PI 1.1.1.

The performance indicators should reflect these management objectives and include the desired level of risk and timelines for meeting those performance indicators. Ultimately, the performance indicators, trade-offs, and reference points etc. are determined by the stakeholders involved in the management strategy evaluation process.

The data needs should outline:

- · The type of data required.
- · The assessment model that is to be used to inform the MP.

A pre-agreed cut-off date should be considered for the data that will be used to inform the MSE process, including the operating models and the candidate(s) and adopted MP.

The completion of the fourth milestone involves the identification of a preferred harvest strategy(ies) adhering to an MP approach. The evidence for this identification includes endorsement from the management agency or relevant body, such as a Commission. The preferred harvest strategy(ies)

that is identified at the completion of the fourth milestone does not necessarily need to be the same one that is adopted and implemented. However, if it does change, the final adopted and implemented harvest strategy needs to meet the required scoring criteria.

With respect to developing and implementing a catch or effort resource-sharing agreement, this could exist in numerous forms. These include a pre-defined stock-wide reduction or individual fleet or country-based allocation schemes. The key objective is that the harvest strategy has a mechanism to reduce catches, when necessary.

<!-- image -->

## GSE3.2.5, GSE3.2.6, GSE3.3.6 &amp; GSE3.3.7 Milestone timeframes ▲

Where possible, the milestones for the condition pathway should be completed sequentially. For a target stock(s) not previously certified, where SE3.2.5 and 3.2.6 applies, the CAB should assess the milestones throughout each phase and not wait until the end of each phase to assess progress. The CAB should do the same for the milestones set for a target stock(s) that has been previously certified, where SE3.3.6 and 3.3.7 applies.

Where the timeframes of plans developed by the relevant management agency of the UoA(s) is unclear, the CAB should specify a maximum timeframe of 10 years for target stocks not previously certified and five years for target stocks that have been previously certified.

<!-- image -->

## GSE3.3.2 &amp; GSE3.3.4 Condition deadline and milestone timeframes ▲

The CAB should use the results of the gap analysis to set a condition deadline and milestone timeframes that are commensurate with the time it would take to achieve the milestones, within the time appropriate for the target stock(s). The CAB may deviate from the gap analysis where new information becomes available at or before the site visit that was not available or included in the gap analysis.

It is not the MSC's intent that the maximum time is given as a default for the condition to be closed, regardless of the milestones that need to be achieved.

<!-- image -->

## GSE3.5.1 Evaluating progress against the condition ▲

The requirements for evaluating progress against the condition in Section SE are specific to the condition set for PI 1.2.1 and PI 1.2.2 when Section SE is applied. Refer to GSE3.1.1.

<!-- image -->

## GSE3.5.3 'Behind target' ▲

'Behind target' means actions, outcomes, or milestones have fallen behind the timeframes specified in a condition. Remedial action can include the CAB setting new milestones, provided these are still expected to achieve the condition within the timeframes identified at the time of setting the condition.

## GSE3.5.3, GSE3.5.5, GSE3.5.6 &amp; GSE3.6.2 Full assessment after suspension related to conditions ▲

The MSC's intent is that if a UoC has failed to achieve a condition by its deadline, the fishery client is not allowed to enter the same UoCs, or entities in the UoC(s), into (re)assessment under either the same or an alternative name or alias where the intention is to extend the duration of the condition into a new certification period.

## GSE3.5.4 Back 'on target' ▲

<!-- image -->

Back 'on target' means meeting the original milestones within 12 months of falling behind.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard v3.1

## GSE3.5.7 Reporting condition progress ▲

Such reports include the Surveillance Reports, Announcement Comment Draft Report, Client and Peer Review Draft Report, Public Comment Draft Report, Final Draft Report, and the Public Certification Report.

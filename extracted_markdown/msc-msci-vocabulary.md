| Input/output reconciliation             | For CoC clients: a calculation of the conversion rate between  volumes purchased and sold, and between inputs and output  volumes into each processing step (where relevant). This may be  between 2 time periods, in relation to 1 batch, or in relation to 1  batch within a defined time period. The purpose of the  input/output reconciliation is to demonstrate that certified outputs  are not greater than the inputs, except as related to added  ingredients, and that the conversion rates are accurate and  justifiable. |
| Inseparable or practicably  inseparable | Where a non-target catch is practicably indistinguishable during  normal fishing operations (i.e. the catch is from a stock of the  same species or a closely related species) or, if distinguishable, it  is not commercially feasible to separate non-target catch from the  target catch due to the practical operation of the fishery that  would require significant modification to existing harvesting and  processing methods.                                                                                               |

It might also include other situations, for  example the catches of a stock defined in the Unit of Assessment |

| Precautionary approach           | The precautionary approach shall be interpreted to mean being  cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate  and that the absence of adequate scientific information shall not  be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation  and management measures. |
| Precision                        | Refers to the reproducibility of an estimate and is a description of  the effect of random errors. Random error causes an estimate to  be different from the true value in a way that is unpredictable.                                                                                          |

| Principle                                  | A fundamental element in the MSC Fisheries Standard used as  the basis for defining a well-managed and sustainable fishery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Probability                                | Probability interpretations of terms such as 'highly likely' are  provided for general guidance and for when quantitative  measures are available, not to imply that a quantitative measure  is required.  Probability interpretations are intentionally defined differently in  the default tree for Principle 1 and components of Principle 2.  They reflect differences in understanding about these  components, legal requirements or past MSC practice.                                                                      |
| Processes and production  methods standard | A standard that sets out criteria for the processes and/or  production methods by which a product or service is produced, in  pursuit of specific social and/or environmental objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Product authentication testing             | The use of DNA analysis or other product authentication tools  which, for example, identify seafood by species, catch area, or  farm of origin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Productivity Susceptibility  Analysis      | Used as the 'Level 2' analysis in the RBF. This semi-quantitative  approach examines several attributes of each species that  contribute to or reflect its productivity or susceptibility, to provide  a relative measure of the risk to the scoring element from fishing  activities. The PSA is required when using the RBF to score  target species in P1 and may also be triggered for retained  species or bycatch species in P2. Each species (scoring element)  identified within a given PI is assigned its own PSA score. |

Usually, there are measurement units associated with  the data (e.g. metres) in the case of the height of a person. It  makes sense to set boundary limits to such data, and it is also  meaningful to apply arithmetic operations to the data. |

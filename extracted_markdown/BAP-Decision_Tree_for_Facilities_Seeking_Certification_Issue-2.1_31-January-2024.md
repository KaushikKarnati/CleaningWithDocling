## Decision Tree for Facilities Seeking Certification Under BAP Hatchery Standard Issue 2.1

## BAP Multi-Star Claim

BAP certified processing plants are permitted to claim up to 4 stars based on the BAP certified facilities in their production chain. For a processing plant to claim a 'hatchery star' at least one of the types of facilities described in the BAP Hatchery Standard must have successfully completed an external CB audit to the full scope of the Hatchery Standard. Please refer to the definitions given for facility types in the introduction to the Hatchery Standard (broodstock/maturation facilities, hatcheries, nurseries, or integrated multi-phase hatcheries).    Typically,  the  'hatchery  star'  will  be  derived  from  the  stage  of  production  immediately preceding the transfer or sale of stocking animals to a grow-out farm. The decision tree diagram included in this document is intended to provide guidance to determine what part of a seedstock supply chain must be certified to achieve the BAP hatchery-related Star.

Although  BAP  does  not  require  seedstock  suppliers  'upstream'  in  the  production  chain  (the  certified hatchery's source of stocking animals) to become BAP certified, such suppliers must nonetheless at least have been qualified through a supplier approval system that includes an annual internal review by the certified hatchery of each of its seedstock suppliers using any one of the three following approaches.

- 1. The supplier(s) are currently certified under the BAP Hatchery Standard.
- 2. The certified hatchery conducts annual internal audits of each of its seedstock suppliers against the full scope of the BAP Hatchery Standard (note that such audits can be conducted remotely or onsite).  Certified facilities must confirm that there are no substantial or critical failures to comply with food safety, legal, social, environmental, or animal welfare issues and that there are no risks to the integrity of the BAP standards.
- 3. The certified hatchery has in place a Supplier Approval program and shares with the CB (copied to BAP) at the time of its annual audit a detailed report using a supplemental checklist that will be provided by BAP, describing at a minimum for each supplier (This option does not apply to hatchery suppliers to BAP certified nurseries).
- a. the name of each seedstock supplier;
- b. the  claims  each  seedstock  supplier  makes  concerning  stock  characteristics,  such  as whether  purchased  stocks  are  hybrid,  triploid,  sterile,  sex-reversed,  all-female,  all-male, rapid growth rate, feed efficiency, specific pathogen free or specific pathogen resistant status, or other characteristics;
- c. the evidence provided by each supplier of disease testing performed on purchased stocks prior to shipment;
- d. the biosecurity measures applied by each seedstock supplier;
- e. descriptions of any physical or chemical interventions such as eyestalk ablation, hormone treatments, vaccinations, etc., are used in the production of purchased seedstock;
- f. documentation  demonstrating  that  the  seedstock  suppliers  are  meeting  the  legal requirements for operation within the country where they are operating, including:
- i. current and valid documents to prove legal land and water use by the hatchery.
- ii. current and valid documents to prove all business and operating licenses have been acquired.
- iii. current and valid documents to prove compliance with applicable local and national environmental regulations for hatchery siting, construction, operation and liability for environmental damage.
- g. evidence of any current third-party certifications the supplier has obtained

For the hatchery-related Star to transfer legitimately to BAP-certified farms, there cannot be any gaps in the production  chain  between  certified  hatcheries  and  the  certified  growout  farms  to  which  they  supply seedstock. When the hatchery supply chain involves changes in ownership of products between separate companies, the stage immediately preceding transfer of live aquatic products to a farm MUST be certified for the hatchery-related Star to transfer through to a BAP-certified farm. In vertically integrated, multi-phase hatchery operations, all 'attached' stages (meaning located within a 30-minute radius of one another) must be  included  in  the  hatchery  audit.    More  remote  facilities  'upstream'  in  the  supply  chain  of  integrated operations may at BAP's sole discretion be allowed to be excluded from the annual onsite audit but in such cases at a minimum the information specified under point 3 above must be supplied.

A multi-tiered production process often occurs in salmon farming companies, which may include saltwaterbased  broodstock  cages,  freshwater  land-based  spawning,  egg  incubation,  hatching  and  early  rearing phases, followed by a marine smolt production phase and finally the marine growout phase to market-sized salmon.  When salmon smolt net pen operations are located in marine environments (greater than 25 ppt) close  to  the  sites  where  final  growout  occurs,  and  also  report  operationally  to  growout  farming management (rather than to  hatchery  management),  such  sites  must  become  fully  certified  under  the scope  of  the  BAP  Salmon  Farm  Standard,  rather  than  the  Hatchery  Standard.    For  salmon  farms,  the hatchery-related 'Star' will be derived from the land-based hatchery phase that precedes the transfer of smolts to saltwater, not from the smolt operations themselves.

Commercial  penaeid  shrimp  hatchery  operations  often  rely  upon  imported  stocks  of  either  adult broodstock for direct use, or upon in-country Broodstock Multiplication Centers (BMC's) that import parent post-larvae (PPL) from geographically distant Nucleus Breeding Centers (NBC's) which are then grown in highly  biosecure  facilities  to  broodstock  size  and  subsequently  sold  to  local  commercial  hatchery customers for production of post-larval animals for sale to growout farm customers.  In most cases it is these local commercial shrimp hatcheries that must seek BAP certification for the 'hatchery star' to be awarded, but the suppliers of the seedstock to such BAP-certified hatcheries must be qualified under one of the three approaches listed above.  BMC's that supply broodstock to BAP-certified hatcheries must at a minimum provide details obtained from their overseas NBC suppliers of PPL's concerning the supplier's genetic improvement goals, as specified under point 3)c above.

BAP will consider on a case-by-case basis as needed, any special situations (such as some vertically integrated multi-phase breeding operations) that may not clearly fit within the audit scenarios described in this document.  If facilities or Certification Body auditors are uncertain how to determine the required unit  of  certification  for  a  particular  seedstock  supply  chain,  please  contact  BAP's  Program  Integrity department at programintegrity@globalseafood.org for guidance.

## Operation:  Seedstock Site

For the sake of the BAP Hatchery Standard and this Decision Tree document, the term ' Seedstock ' will be used as a universal term to refer to the live aquatic animals a hatchery obtains or maintains for the purpose of  producing  the  juvenile  stages  that  are  sold  or  transferred  to  growout  farms.    'Broodstock'  and 'maturation' facilities  are  characterized  as  a  location  where  broodstock  populations  are  kept.  Nucleus Breeding  Centers  (NBC's)  are  specialized  broodstock  facilities  typically  very  far  removed  from  other hatchery operations.

S1

S2

Is the seedstock site attached to the hatchery being audited?

<!-- image -->

'Attached' meaning adjacent or nearby (&lt;30 minutes travel time). Must be owned, managed, and operated by the same organization.

S3

The hatchery 'Star' will not be derived from the seedstock supplier. See Hatchery Site Flow Diagram.

## Operation:  Hatchery Site

Hatchery site refers to operations such as: maturation, incubation/hatching, eggs and fry or fingerlings for fish are grown to commercially accepted/customer-specified stages for transfer or sale to nursery and/or grow-out facilities. It can also be a 'hatch house', a term used to describe systems located within a farm facility where eggs are hatched, typically in incubators and then the fry/larvae are reared to a size suitable for stocking at the farm or for transfer/sale to other farms.

H1

H2

Is the facility a 'hatch house' located on a land-based farm that receives eggs or larvae directly from a BAP certified seedstock facility?

<!-- image -->

H3

Is the production from the hatchery sold or transferred to intermediate nursery sites?

The hatch house will be included in the scope of the farm's certification audit. The hatchery 'Star' would in this case be derived from certification of the seedstock supplier.

H5

The hatchery must become BAP certified. **

** Seedstock suppliers to BAP certified hatcheries must be qualified by either: 1) annual internal audits , or 2) implementation of an Approved Supplier System .  Records shall be available at the time of the CB Audit of the hatchery. Note: if the seedstock suppliers to certified hatcheries are already themselves BAP certified, neither of these alternative approaches is required .

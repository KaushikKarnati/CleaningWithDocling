## Unannounced Audit Policy for SPS Audits

Issue 3.0 24-October-2024

## 1. Scope and Purpose

- 1.1 Per  GFSI  benchmark  requirements,  facilities  certifying  under  the  GSA  Seafood  Processing Standard (SPS) must undergo one unannounced audit every three years. These unannounced audits  shall  be  planned  and  conducted  by  the  CB.  The  criteria  detailed  below  applies  for  all unannounced audits.

## 2. Timing and Pre-requisites of Unannounced Audits

- 2.1 Initial audits of new facilities shall not be unannounced.
- 2.2 Initial unannounced audit years shall be confirmed during the recertification application process and requirements shall be agreed upon as stated herein.
- 2.2.1 Starting June 1, 2023, all recertifying SPS facilities that have not had an unannounced audit in the past 3 years shall be mandated to have an unannounced audit as per Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) benchmark.  Failure to meet this requirement may result in a suspension from the Certification Program.
- 2.2.2 Starting October  1, 2022, all recertifying SPS  facilities must  submit  completed applications and audit fee payments to GSA at least 6 months prior to their certificate expiration date.  Applications and payments submitted less than 6 months of expiration dates may result in a lapse in certification.
- 2.3 Once  an  initial  unannounced  year  is  determined,  subsequent  unannounced  audits  must  be conducted at least once every three-year period.
- 2.4 Dates  of  unannounced  audits  during  corresponding  audit  cycles  shall  be  determined  by  the assigned CB.
- 2.5 During the unannounced audit cycle the CB shall give notice to the facility that an unannounced audit is pending. Said notification shall:
- 2.5.1 be  made  by  the  CB  at  least  4.5  months  (135  calendar  days)  prior  to  the  certificate expiration date.
- 2.5.2 initiate finalization of any agreements and communications required between the CB and the facility to conduct the audit.
- 2.5.3 specify a 60-day window in which the unannounced audit shall take place.
- 2.5.4 communicate to the facility that adequate personnel must be available, during normal business operating hours, within the 60-day window stipulated for the audit.
- 2.5.5 general expectations for the first date of the audit plan (see 4.3).
- 2.6 Once the communication in 2.5 is made by the CB to the facility, the facility may elect to request a black-out period of two weeks (14 calendar days) within the 60-day window to accommodate shut-down periods, non-production days, or annual maintenance that the facility might have to undertake. Such request by the facility should be made within 10 calendar days of the notice by the CB (2.5). Such black-out period must be agreed upon by the CB and the facility.
- 2.7 Communications occurring between the CB and the facility after those completed in 2.5-2.6 shall be restricted from containing any information related to the unannounced audit dates.
- 2.8 Unannounced  audits  must  not  take  place  on  weekends  (or  holy/religious  days)  or  official holidays in the region where the facility is located.
- 2.9 For  seasonal  facilities,  the  60-day  window  may  be  reduced  at  the  discretion  of  the  CB  to accommodate seasonal variations

## 3. Unannounced Audit Operational Criteria

- 3.1 All  unannounced audits shall be conducted on-site.  Remote audits do not qualify for unannounced audits.
- 3.2 Unannounced audits shall be conducted to the standard version to which the facility applied to.
- 3.3 If the facility denies the CB Auditor access to the site without reasonable cause, audit fees paid by the facility shall be forfeited and the facility's certificate may be suspended/withdrawn at the discretion of the CB. The CB must immediately inform GSA.
- 3.4 If the facility claims they cannot  accept the  unannounced  audit  when  the  auditor  arrives  at  the facility due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, the following applies:
- 3.4.1 The  auditor  shall  notify  the  CB  for  a  determination  as  to  whether  the  audit  should continue or be rescheduled.
- 3.4.2 Rescheduling of the audit makes the unannounced audit invalid and could result in a lapse in certification.  Additionally, invalidation of an unannounced audit year could result in suspension from the program (see 2.2.1).  Because the CB has inccurred expenses in auditor travel and time, audit fees paid by the facility shall be forfeited.
- 3.4.3 The CB shall inform GSA of any such outcome.
- 3.5 Auditors shall be trained by CBs in unannounced audit protocols.
- 3.6 All  KPIs  and timelines for  report submission, NC closures, technical reviews and certification decisions are similar to that of announced audits.
- 3.7 'Certification'  and  'No-certification'  decision  by  the  CB  also  shall  be  determined  in  a  similar manner as that of announced audits.

## 4. Unannounced Audit Process

- 4.1 Duration and process of unannounced audits shall be similar to that of announced audits as specified in the CB Requirements document.
- 4.2 Unannounced audits shall  start  immediately  upon  the  arrival  of  the  CB  auditor  at  the  facility without delay.  Delays may be grounds for cancellation of the unannounced audit and must be communicated by the auditors to their CB immediately.
- 4.3 A preliminary visual walk-through shall be conducted as soon as the auditor arrives on site.  This is to observe if there are any ongoing inappropriate practices with regards to food safety/GMPs/SSOPs/social criteria of the SPS when the auditor first arrives.
- 4.4 The opening meeting shall take place after the initial walk-through.
- 4.5 A thorough facility tour/ inspection by the CB auditor shall continue after the opening meeting without undue delay. Day 1 of facility inspection shall include, at a minimum, the following:
- 路 physical  infrastructure  with  associated  HACCP/food  safety  plans,  GMPs,  and SSOPs
- 路 selection of lots for traceability tests
- 路 worker interviews
- 路 selection of product samples to be drawn for testing
- 4.6 Issue of NCs, corrective action review, and non-conformity closures are handled similar to that of an announced audit as in CB Requirements document.
- 4.7 If there are extenuating circumstances, the CB shall contact Program Integrity (programintegrity@globalseafood.org), with CB Dept (CBDept@globalseafood.org) and Certification (certification@globalseafood.org) on copy, for guidance.

- 5.1.1 Case 1) The facility collects its own samples under auditor supervision. The auditor supervises the sampling process and verifies that samples are taken from the correct locations using accepted sample collection methods.  SPS clauses A2 2.6.1, A2 2.6.2 and A2 2.6.3 apply.

- On  day-1  of  the  audit,  the  facility  shall  contact  the  lab  to  see  if  the  sampling  could  be conducted within the time frame of the audit.  Under case 2) testing is able to be conducted under short notice.  The auditor supervises the sampling process and verifies that samples are  taken  from  the  correct  locations  using  accepted  sample  collection  methods.    SPS clauses A2 2.6.1, A2 2.6.2 and A2 2.6.3 apply
- 5.1.3 Case 3) The facility employs a designated 3rd party sampling team,  and sampling and testing is not  able  to be  conducted  under  short  notice  during  the  audit  period. On  day-1  of  the  audit,  the  facility  shall  contact  the  lab  to  see  if  the  sampling  could  be conducted  within  the  time  frame  of  the  audit.    Under  case  3)  testing  is  not  able  to  be conducted under short notice.  During the audit, the facility shall verify with the auditor the date that the sampling has been scheduled.

Under 5.1.3, the sampling plan shall be applied to SPS clause A2 2.6.1.   Clauses A2 2.6.2 and A2 6.2.3 shall be recorded by the auditor as Not Applicable.   Failure of the facility to ensure that the CB receives test results in a timely manner may result in lapse in certification.

## 6. Product Testing (Annex 4)

- 6.3     Sampling shall be conducted on species available during the audit. If species within the certification scope  are  not  available  during  the  unannounced  audit,  the  auditor  will  select  samples  that  will provide the verification intent contained within Annex 4 testing tables II, III, and IV as applicable.
- 6.4 In the event sampling is delayed due to 3rd party sampling and laboratory testing schedule conflicts or constraints, samples shall remain under control of the facilities quality team (QC hold), under secure storage and delivered to laboratory within 10 business days of the unannounced audit.

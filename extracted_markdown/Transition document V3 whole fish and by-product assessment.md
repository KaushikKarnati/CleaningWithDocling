## Transition guidance for Version 3 of the MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria and the MarinTrust by-product assessment criteria

Version 3 of the MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria and Version 3 of the MarinTrust byproduct assessment criteria were issued in October 2023 and will be effective from 1st May 2024. Starting from October 2023, there is a transition period for Version 3 of the whole fish and by-product assessments.

## Transition plan for by-product assessments

All by-products that are used as raw materials for certified marine ingredients are evaluated against the MarinTrust by-product assessment criteria. If the by-product species fulfils these criteria, then the by-product is approved. For by-products, approval is subject to annual assessments.

To facilitate the transition to the Version 3 by-product assessment criteria, the following transition period will be applied:

- 1. Between May 1st  2024, and May 1st 2025, all applications (new or re-certification) to Version 3 of that MarinTrust Standard that have by-product species in the scope of the application, the by-products will be assessed against Version 3 of the MarinTrust by-product assessment. All currently approved by-products for certified facilities will continue to be assessed against the current Version 2 MarinTrust by-product assessment.
- 2. From May 1 st 2025, all by-products will be assessed against Version 3.
- Â· Starting in November, MarinTrust will communicate the process for assessing byproducts for certification in 2025. This will help certificate holders understand the process  and  gather  additional  information  required  for  assessment  against Version 3.

Current certificate holders who may want to move to Version 3 for their by-products sooner can contact MarinTrust for further guidance.

## Transition plan for whole fish fishery assessments

Whole fish fisheries that supply raw materials for certified marine ingredients are evaluated based on the MarinTrust whole fish fisheries assessment criteria. If a fishery meets these criteria, it receives approval for three years and is subject to successful annual surveillance assessments.

To facilitate the transition to Version 3 whole fish assessment criteria, the following transition period will be applied:

- 1. From May 1 st 2024, all new whole fish fisheries not currently assessed or approved shall be assessed against Version 3 MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria.
- 2. Whole fish fisheries that are currently approved and are due for a re-approval assessment between May 1 st 2024 and May 1 st 2025 shall be assessed against Version 3.
- 3. Whole fish fisheries that are currently approved and are due for a surveillance assessment between May 1 st 2024 and May 1 st 2025  shall be assessed against Version 2.
- 4. From May 1 st 2025, all whole fish fisheries shall be assessed against Version 3, regardless of the assessment cycle. For any surveillance assessment due after May 1 st 2025, these shall be a re-approval assessment.

For Fishery Improvement Projects that are part of the MarinTrust Improver Programme:

- 1. From May 1 st 2024, all new applications shall complete the GAP analysis against Version 3 MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria.
- 2. By May 1 st 2025, all existing Fishery Improvement Projects shall update their GAP analysis and Fishery Action Plan (FAP) against Version 3 MarinTrust whole fish fishery assessment criteria.

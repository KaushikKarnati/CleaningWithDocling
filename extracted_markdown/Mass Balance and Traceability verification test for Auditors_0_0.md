## Guidance for Auditors to understand a Mass Balance exercise and Verification Test

## Introduction

The marine ingredients production and trade is very important for the development and grow of the food and feed industry, aquaculture and other related livestock production.

We have to assure the sustainability across all this value chain as a crucial aspect to manage and communicate to all the stakeholders. Final customers' requirements are forcing many industries to show improvements and commitment through third party Sustainability certifications.

MarinTrust is one of these Standards that is evolving and improving to guarantee the marine ingredients supply in an ethical and sustainable way.

The following Mass Balance exercise is a tool that will contribute to avoid fraud or bad practices along the CoC.

## Scope

The  marine  ingredients  are  basically  2  products:  Fishmeal  and  Fish  Oil.  Both  are  normally elaborated in the same facility and share the process line. The yields that can be expected in the production are based in the composition of the raw material used.

Whole fish (different species)

Trimmings, offal, discards (canning, frozen fish)

This  is  important  to  consider  because  the  marine  ingredient  will  have  different  quality characteristics depending of the raw material and it´s freshness. The main quality parameters to consider are:

| Fishmeal   | Fish Oil                         |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Protein    | FFA (Free Fatty Acids)           |
| Ash        | Moisture and impurities          |
| Fat        | Peroxide                         |
| Moisture   | Anisidine                        |
| Salt       | TOTOX                            |
| FFA        | Fatty Acid profile (EPA and DHA) |
| TVN        | Gardner Color                    |
| Histamine  | Soap content                     |

## Fishmeal Criteria

It  is  also  important  to  know  that  yields  for  fishmeal  normally  are  better  when  whole  fish  is processed, comparing with trimmings or offal. This is explained because whole fish has more 'flesh', therefore more protein in the fishmeal. While fishmeal from trimmings are higher in ash and lower in protein, unless there will be a process to remove part of the fish bones that will decrease ash content but increase protein. But this will affect more the final yield. Only for reference, the yield from whole fish (Peruvian anchovy) to fishmeal is 4 - 4.5 tons of fish for 1 ton of fishmeal. That means 25 - 22%.

For Fishmeal, the first 4 parameters (Protein, Ash, Fat and Moisture) are call proximate analysis and usually their sum is around 100%. Additional parameters constitute the proximate when other  compounds  containing  crude  fibre  and  Nitrogen-Free  Extract  (NFE,  more  or  less representing sugar and starches) are added, e.g. when feed is elaborated including vegetable origin ingredients.

This is important to know, because this proximate and the other parameters like salt, FFA, TVN and Histamine, can be followed through all the CoC and is expected to be relative constant. The parameter that can vary significantly during storage, specially where very humid environment occurs,  is  moisture.  In  this  case,  moisture  can  increase  and  the  other  3  parameters  of  the proximate will decrease proportionally.

These quality criteria have to be considered when fishmeal is mixed, blended and repacked. In this case, losses can be considered due to transport and process, especially when is done in bulk. Gains  are  also  possible  if  some  additives  are  included  in  this  process,  e.g.,  organic  acids  or antioxidants.

## Fish Oil criteria

Crude Fish oil, depending on the raw material and process, can be destined for feed or for human consumption. Crude Fish oil for Human consumption has to start with fishing vessels additionally registered for this purpose, raw material fit for crude fish oil for HC and dedicated process and storage. Additional process like Fish oil for feed is incorporated normally in the crude form. The yield will depend on the fat content of the raw material.

The quality parameters to follow in the same way as fishmeal are FFA, moisture, peroxide and Anisidine (if you have both, you can calculate TOTOX = 2Peroxide+1Anisidine). Special attention is needed with Fatty Acid profile (EPA and DHA) for the importance in the nutritional properties for  aquaculture,  foods,  nutraceutical  supplements  and  pharmaceutical  applications.  When blending  processes  occur,  a  correct  traceability  and  mass  balance  related  to  the  quality parameters is a must.

Sometimes,  when  crude  fish  oil  with  very  high  FFA  is  produced,  semi-refined  process (degumming/neutralization) can be applied to reduce this content. But the losses are relevant and are in function of the FFA and other parameters. As general reference, approximately the

losses will be 2 fold the sum of FFA, moisture and impurities. If a bleaching process is included to  reduce  the  dark  color,  additional  losses  will  be  considered  with  the  oil  retained  in  the bleaching earth incorporated and then filtered.

If we have an acid fish oil with 8% FFA, 1% moisture and 1% impurities, the loss will be around 20%. This is important to take into account for the mass balance because in case of traders / processors these losses need to be reflected in the quantities at the beginning and at the end. That means it´s not acceptable to have 100 tons of 8% FFA and finally 100 tons of 3% FFA, because the losses when the FFA is reduced is at least 2 fold the difference in FFA, that means the final quantity should be 90 tons of 3% FFA.

The other possible case is a crude fish oil that is mixed with a neutralized one. The way this can be detected is comparing the original quality parameters and the final ones. The FFA and the color will be lower and there will be an additional parameter to consider: soap content.

The same concept is applicable to fish oil refining and concentration, where additional processes are in course: Refining (neutralization), Bleaching, Winterization, Deodorization or Purification, esterification / trans esterification. In each step specific criteria are applied and will depend on the technology, individual basis, and characteristics of the fish oil processed.

Along all the CoC, fish oil is normally stored and transported in bulk. These operations could become additional threat to fish oil integrity due to the possibilities of intended or unintended mixtures  with  non-certified  fish  oils.  Also  changes  during  transport,  extracting  fish  oil  and substituting with water or another kind of substances could happen. In this context, quantities will match. So is a good practice monitoring the stock and quality of the product stored and transported to contrast the product dispatched and received.

The losses during fish oil bulk transport is considered less than 0.2% due to the oil that will stay attached to the walls and will depend on how fluid is the product. The stearin (solid part of the oil at room temperature) is a natural part of the fish oil but it can be more difficult to removed due to the higher density compared with the fluid part (olein).

In the case of storage tanks, when they are being dispatched, is not feasible to take out all the fish  oil.  Normally  some  tank  bottoms  with  high  stearin  content  will  remain  and  have  to  be removed manually. This is a common situation especially when the fish oil has been stored without movements for a long period of time. In this case, a natural separation occurs, the stearin tends to stay in the bottom of the tank, while the olein remains on the top.

The following table can summarize the relation between quantities and quality to perform a Mass balance as a useful tool that will allow to show good practices, transparency and real commitment to the fish ingredients sustainability.

The first part refers to the production yield obtained from raw material to fishmeal and fish oil. As mentioned before, the yields will depend on the fat and solids (protein and ash) content in the raw material and is in function of the nature of the fish used and if it´s is whole or parts like trimmings.

The second part consists in the operations of storage, blending and transport of the finished products.  This  could  be  done  by  the  same  producer  and/or  traders,  subcontractors.  In  this movements, gains are related to inclusion of additives and losses come from material that could not be completely removed from storage tanks, cisterns and conveyors. The quality parameters of  the  products  have  to  be  relative  stable  because  there  aren't  processes  that  change  the characteristics mentioned in the table. Even if blending operations occurs, the final product will be  the  mixture  of  known  products  and  the  result  is  the  weighted  average  of  the  quality parameters.

The third part includes only crude fish oil processing, considering feed and food uses. In the fish oil  refining  and  concentration  processes,  losses  are  closely  related  to  quality  parameters, specially FFA, moisture and impurities. EPA and DHA content is determinant in outcome yields when concentration of their ethyl esters are in place.

Finally, the fourth part is regarding the use of fishmeal and fish oil for feed production. In this case, more gains have to be considered due to the addition of diverse ingredients, greater in proportion than the marine ingredients.

## Mass Balance

With these criteria, the mass balance can be performed by asking the applicant for a specific lot or a period of time of production.

Due to the different kind of applicants and their diverse management systems, the compilation of  the  data  needed  can  spend  considerable  time  because  part  of  the  information  will  be managed by the quality area, while the quantities / yields normally are in the production area.

The  template  asks  for  raw  materials  bought  and  in  stock,  product  during  process  and  final product sold an in stock during the evaluated period.

Losses and gains have to be considered and checked with the general criteria described and the balance has to match not only quantities but quality criteria.

If  some issue doesn't match, e.g. significantly difference in tons or quality parameters, more information or explanations are necessary to ask. Care must be taken in the way this questions are  done.  The  idea  is  to  give  insights  on  how  this  can  be  an  opportunity  to  improve  the traceability.

## Definitions

- · Mass  Balance:  Generally,  a  term  used  in  comparisons  of  the  inputs  and  outputs  of processes.
- · Total oxidation value (ToTox) = 2 x Peroxide value + 1 x Anisidine value
- · Explanatory note: Oxidation of fish oils is a sequential process: following an initial raise of peroxide value, the anisidine value rises. The peroxide value is therefore a parameter for primary oxidation products, the anisidine value for secondary oxidation products. The parameter ToTox, which means "total oxidation of oil", was established to avoid that both of these oxidation products are present at maximum levels. The maximum allowed ToTox value is set separately and lower than the sum of the individual possible maximum limits set for peroxide and anisidine values.
- · Secondary recovery: fish oil recovered from the pumping sea water used to unload the fish  from  the  vessels  to  the  plants.  The  process  includes  physical  flotation  with  or without microbubbles, superficial foams collecting and further heating and separation of the fish oil. It´s also called PAMA oil in Peru, and is considered only for feed purposes. It could be 20% of the fish oil yield.

## Traceability verification test

When  an  applicant  performs  a  Traceability  verification  test,  the  minimum  information  to consider to assure a proper and complete traceability forward and back, is the follows:

- · Species
- · Fishing vessels
- · Catch area
- · Raw Material weight / Dates of landing
- · Marine Ingredients Producer factory
- · Marine ingredients producer factory Dates of processing
- · Marine Ingredient Product (Batch/Lot number - volume produced)
- · Product identification (documentation related: delivery notes, invoices, Bill of lading, certificates of analysis, official certificates, etc.)
- · Product received (Batch/Lot number - volume produced)
- · Feed / Food processing factory
- · Dates of finished product processing
- · Finished product (Batch/Lot number - volume produced)
- · Product dispatched

If a trader or third party storage is involved in this verification test, where mixtures or blending processes occurs, information about these operations should be included.

The objective is to check the last test done by the applicant and the auditor can ask for a random set of records or specific information stated in the test. For example, records linking a vessel with a specific landing / weight, or some production records or stock reports.

## Mass Balance / Volume reconciliation

If a  Mass  Balance  is  performed  considering  a  specific  batch/lot  or  volume  produced,  in complement with a traceability verification test, raw material and finished product should match regarding inputs and outputs.

Due to different management and processing control systems, the result of this Mass Balance will not be as exact as expected because factories normally use production orders or production reports for periods of time between one day and one month instead of calculating yields per lot or batch.

Similar to the traceability verification test, the auditor should make a sampling procedure for information stated in the Mass Balance, in order to crosscheck data for consistency.

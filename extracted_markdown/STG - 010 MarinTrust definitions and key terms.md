<!-- image -->

A temporary worker employed by an employment agency, and then hired out to perform his/her work at (and under the supervision of) a user company. There is no employment relationship between the temporary agency worker and the user company, although there could be legal obligations of the user company towards the temporary agency worker, especially with respect to health and safety. The relevant labour contract is of limited or unspecified duration with no guarantee of continuation. The hiring firm pays fees to the employment agency, and the agency pays the wages (even if the hiring company has not yet paid the agency).

Reference : International Labour Organization (ILO) C181 - Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181)

The agent works on behalf of either the seller or the buyer and facilitates the transaction (sale or purchase). The agent does not take ownership and can be seen as an alternative to having inhouse sales or purchase employees, they typically get paid a percentage of the activity.

Models that use the same methodology as single species production models, but they pool all the relevant species together and treat them as a single time series.

Follow up audit(s) to assess compliance with the specific -requirements of MarinTrust scheme's Standards and to verify the validity of an issued certificate for both the Factory and Chain of Custody Standard clients.

Relates to decisions, either certification or accreditation decisions. They are issues raised regarding a certification decision, or an accreditation decision.

Reference : MarinTrust Procedure A6 - Appeals and Complaints Procedure for the MarinTrust Programme

A company, or group of companies under common ownership, which has applied for certification under the MarinTrust Programme through the formal application process.

A company or group of companies under common ownership is a formal applicant after the application has been approved by MarinTrust and shared with the applicant's chosen Certification Body.

Note: applicant shall be written in all lower case unless at the beginning of a sentence.

An apprenticeship is a paid job which offers direct work experience alongside off-the-job training. It provides a way for individuals to earn while they learn, gaining valuable skills and knowledge in a specific job role.

which are typically discarded by the person processing the fish/shellfish. They can include;

- · Component parts that are traditionally defined as 'waste,'
- · Parts of fish not directly used for human consumption but may be used as a raw material for marine ingredients production.
- · Where whole fish have been allocated by-product status due to proven, unintentional spoilage, this may be permitted.

Other terms commonly used to describe by-products include; fish waste, processing waste, offal, 'rest' raw material, trimmings, processing discards.

A by-product assessment conducted by a registered Certification Body. Process by which by-products are checked against specific criteria to ensure they comply with the requirements of MarinTrust.

The fishing gear(s) used to capture fish / shellfish.

See also fishing gear .

The amount of catch that is taken per unit of fishing effort (e.g. number of fish per longline hook-months). Nominal CPUE is often used as a measure of the economic efficiency of a type of gear. Standardised CPUE (e.g. estimated from a time series of fishing surveys) is normally used as an abundance index for "tuning" assessment models.

Fishery

Fishing effort

Fisheries management

Fishery action plan

Fishery improvement project (FIP)

<!-- image -->

A unit determined by an authority or other entity that is engaged in raising and/or harvesting fish. Typically, the unit is defined in terms of one or more of the following: people involved, species or type of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats and purpose of the activities.

For the purposes of MarinTrust, a fishery is defined by the species, fishing gear and geographic location of fishing activity.

The amount of fishing gear of a specific type used on the fishing grounds over a given unit of time for example hours trawled per day, number of hooks set per day or number of hauls of a beach seine per day. When two or more kinds of gear are used, the respective efforts must be adjusted to some standard type before being added (FAO, 1997).

Reference : Food and Agriculture Organization (1997). Fisheries management. FAO Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries No. 4. Rome, FAO. 82p.

An integrated process that aims to improve the benefits that society receives from harvesting fish, while maintaining ecological health and balancing other societal needs. It includes the activities of (i) formation of laws, rules, and regulations (ii) policy and planning, (iii) data and information; (iv) allocation of resources; (iv) compliance and enforcement and (vi) stakeholder engagement. The main aim is to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and accomplishment of other fisheries objectives.

A schedule of improvements for a fishery with associated resources and those responsible, based on individual aspects of the fishery that require improvements and take place within a specified time frame.

A multi-stakeholder effort to improve the sustainability of a fishery and may vary in scope and nature. It is used to facilitate improvements within a fishery no matter where that fish is going to.

If the fish is being used in marine ingredient production, then the MarinTrust Improver Programme offers recognition of that marine ingredient production while encouraging the supply chain to be involved in the improvement efforts at the fishery level. This ensures improvements in fisheries supplying into the supply chain are benefiting a broader range of stakeholders as well as gaining support from these.

To be a credible FIP it must meet a number of requirements pertaining to participation, funding, transparency, and scientific rigor.

The equipment used for fishing, e.g. bait boat, gillnet, handline, harpoon, haul seine, longline, midwater trawl, purse seine, rod-andreel, trap, and trawler. Each of these gears can have multiple configurations.

Intended use is for human consumption or incorporation into foodstuffs for human consumption all work or service which is exacted from any person under the threat of a penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily.

The right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their own choosing. Freedom of association and the exercise of collective bargaining provide opportunities for constructive dialogue and resolution of conflict, between employers and employees.

It implies a respect for the right of employers and workers to freely and voluntarily establish and join organisations of their own choice and means that these organisations have the right to carry out their activities in full freedom and without interference. Employers should not interfere in the workers' decision to associate or discriminate against the workers or their representative. Workers and employers have the right to join organizations at the national, sectoral, and international levels, and their organizations have the right to affiliate at any level. Workers and employers' organizations should be permanent, without requirements for periodic renewal or other conditions for their continued existence.

a. payments for recruitment services offered by labour recruiters, whether public or private, in matching offers of and applications for employment;

b. payments made in the case of recruitment of workers with a view to employing them to perform work for a third party; c. payments made in the case of direct recruitment by the employer; or

- d. payments required to recover recruitment fees from workers.

These fees may be one-time or recurring and cover recruiting, referral and placement services which could include advertising, disseminating information, arranging interviews, submitting documents for government clearances, confirming credentials, organizing travel and transportation, and placement into employment.

demonstrate they are able to meet in full for a particular service to achieve certification.

The MarinTrust Programme is comprised of the following standards:

- · MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients
- · MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard

The specific set of criteria, also known as 'clauses', that are included within a standard that participants must demonstrate they are able to meet in full for a particular service to achieve certification.

The living resources in the community or population from which catches are taken in a fishery. Use of the term 'stock' implies that the particular population is a biologically distinct unit. As noted in the FAO Fisheries Glossary, some species form a single stock (e.g. southern bluefin tuna) while others are composed of several stocks (e.g. albacore tuna in the Pacific Ocean comprises separate northern and southern stocks).

See also shared stocks .

The process of collecting and analysing biological and statistical information to determine the changes in the abundance of fishery stocks in response to fishing, and, to the extent possible, to predict future trends of stock abundance. Stock assessments are based on resource surveys; knowledge of the habitat requirements, life history, and behaviour of the species; the use of environmental indices to determine impacts on stocks; and catch statistics. Stock assessments are used as a basis to assess and specify the present and probable future condition of a fishery.

| Target catch / species       | In the context of fishery certification, the target catch is the catch of  stock under consideration by the unit of certification  -  i.e., the fish  that are being assessed for certification and ecolabelling.   These will be whole fish fisheries listed on the facilities' certificate. Note, this could be different to the actual species primarily sought  by the fishers in a particular fishery, or the subject of fishing effort  in a fishery (FAO, 2002). |

## Foreword

MarinTrust is the leading independent business to business certification programme for the marine ingredients value chain.

Responsible  sourcing  and  manufacturing  is  vital  if  marine  ingredients  are  to  remain  a  relevant ingredient  in  feed  for  culture,  agriculture,  pet  care  and  directly  in  the  production  of  consumer products, including cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Fishmeal and fish oil make up the largest share of marine ingredients today, however all marine ingredients (see definition in the definitions section below) are included in MarinTrust's scope.

In order to enable stakeholders to credibly demonstrate the commitment to responsible practice in areas of feed safety, raw material procurement, delivery, and throughout the production process, MarinTrust developed a robust Certification Programme1, consisting of three main components:

- · The MarinTrust Standard: The verification and certification of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from approved fisheries and by-product fisheries,
- · The MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard: The verification and certification of the chain  of  custody  for  marine  ingredients (products) that  come  from  MarinTrust  certified factories along the value chain to the customer.
- · The Improver Programme: The verification and approval of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from accepted MarinTrust Improver fisheries.

Standards under the MarinTrust Programme are developed in accordance with the ISEAL Standard Setting Code and following ISO guidance. The programme is managed by the MarinTrust Secretariat under the MarinTrust governance led by its Governance Body Committee (GBC) and subsequent multistakeholder committees.

In order  to  become  certified  under  the  MarinTrust  programme,  applicants  must  be  able  to demonstrate  compliance  with  the  Standard  criteria,  through  a  third-party  audit  conducted  by  an independent,  ISO  17065  accredited  Certification  Body  approved  to  certify  against  MarinTrust Standards. Certificate holders who have demonstrated compliance to the MarinTrust Standard(s) can apply to the MarinTrust Secretariat for use of the Certified MarinTrust Logo2.

The MarinTrust Programme is recognised and endorsed throughout the marine ingredient value chain and by aquaculture certification programmes including BAP, ASC and Global GAP, as well as feed manufacturers, retailers and pet food manufacturers.

## Introduction

## Introduction to the MarinTrust Chain of Custody standard (CoC)

In 2018 MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard V1.1 underwent an extensive review, in line with good practice and in compliance with the ISEAL Standard Setting Code requirement. This review identified areas of opportunity and improvement and these were documented in a new Terms of Reference for the development of a MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard V2.

The MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard V2 was published on 31 August 2020 and is effective from 30 November 2020.

Through the Programme framework, the requirements for certification are subject to continual review and improvement. Subsequent reviews of the standard will be carried out at least every five years to ensure continued relevancy and effectives to achieve its stated objectives.

The purpose of this new Chain of Custody standard is to provide the industry with a clear statement of  the  requirements  of  Chain  of  Custody  Certification  and  to  provide  an  assurance  to  a  labelled Certified  claim  on  a  feed  or  fish  oil  product  that  it  uses  marine  ingredients  that  originate  from  a Certified 'MarinTrust Factory'.

## Key Objectives

- · To ensure that marine ingredients used come from MarinTrust certified sources and that full traceability is maintained throughout the supply chain.
- · To ensure no Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishery materials are used
- · To ensure pure and safe products are further processed under a robust Quality Management System, thereby demonstrating freedom from potentially unsafe and illegal materials
- · To ensure that MarinTrust CoC standard remains relevant, robust and fit for purpose.
- · To prevent non MarinTrust compliant product being labelled as MarinTrust.

## Main features of the revised MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard

The key features of the MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard V2 are summarised below:

## 1) Audit Technology

- · Use of emerging technology (e.g. Key Data Element transfer through the supply chain) to source the origin of certified MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients

## 2) Standard Collaboration

- · Recognition of other standards and regulatory authority standards to meet in part or in full the requirements of the MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard

## 3) Quality Assurance

- · Identify ways of detecting fraudulent activities (e.g. adulterations and substitution) by having  rigorous  traceability  system  checks  e.g.  mass  balance  checks  and  volume reconciliations within the standard and systems to handle non-conforming products
- · Improve the use of the MarinTrust Logo and claim to protect the integrity of the entire programme
- · Continue the current certification model to ensure it remains in alignment with ISO 17065 and the ISEAL Assurance Code.

## 4) Streamlining Requirements

- · Standard and Certification Requirements at each link in the chain need to be reviewed to seek areas of opportunity to streamline, especially in the wholesaler/trader/subcontractor segments.

## SECTION 1 - General Principles of Traceability

- 1.1 The applicant shall have a documented and signed policy that states that they are committed to achieving and adhering to the requirements of the MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard.

Full Compliance: The applicant site has a written commitment to the MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard. This document has been approved and signed by the site's CEO or an equivalent senior manager.

- 1.1.1 The applicant shall have a process to ensure that this policy is communicated to all staff within the site.

Full Compliance: The applicant can demonstrate that this policy has been fully communicated to all staff within the facility. For example, during new staff inductions, staff training etc

## Additional Notes

The rationale of this clause is to re-enforce that all staff in the applicant's organisation are aware of this commitment to this standard to drive positive behaviour to ensure they continuously meet the requirements of the standard. This policy could be communicated through various channels such as training workshops, new staff inductions, posters etc.

- 1.2 The applicant shall have a documented and effective supplier approval and monitoring system to ensure that incoming marine ingredients intended to be identified as compliant, are sourced from an approved fishery, or a certified supplier that holds a valid MarinTrust or MarinTrust CoC certification.

Full Compliance: The applicant will have an up-to-date system of MarinTrust certified suppliers and be able to demonstrate that they hold a valid MarinTrust or MarinTrust CoC certification.

## Additional Notes

The applicant shall ensure that only marine ingredients that has been produced in an MarinTrust certified site from an approved MarinTrust fishery or recognised MarinTrust -MSC fishery are used to produce compliant marine ingredients. Ideally the Marin Trust certified material Suppliers should be

<!-- image -->

listed separated on their own approved supplier list from those that do not handle MarinTrust certified Marine ingredient to clearly show separation, but a single list would also be ok, as long as the Marin Trust certified material suppliers were clearly identified.

- 1.2.1 MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients that are purchased via a third-party agent, or broker that does not physically handle or own the certified product the following shall apply:
- 1.2.1.1. The applicant shall have documents/evidence provided from these suppliers in place, to prove the identity of the marine ingredients back to an approved fishery or by product.

Full Compliance: If the third-party is not certified to the MarinTrust CoC Standard they can provide full documentation to allow complete traceback of marine ingredients to approved fishery, or a supplier that holds a valid MarinTrust or MarinTrust CoC certificate for factory marine ingredients

## Additional Notes

The applicant shall ensure that only marine ingredients that has been produced in an MarinTrust certified site from an approved MarinTrust fishery or recognised MSC fishery are used to produce these compliant marine ingredients.

If an agent or broker does own the product then they will be treated as any other supplier and need an MarinTrust CoC certificate, if they do not wish to be certified then they will be treated as a subcontractor to the applicant and follow the requirements in Section 3

- 1.2.1.2 The applicant shall ensure that they have been trained/made aware/informed on the requirements to maintain the product integrity status of these certified materials and shall sign a form stating their commitment to the MarinTrust CoC standard.
- Full Compliance: If the third-party agent or broker is used to source supplies of the MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients there shall be documented evidence that training has been undertaken by the applicant to this entity to ensure that they fully understand and commit to comply with the requirements of the MarinTrust CoC standard to maintain the product integrity of the MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients. After this training has been completed, the agent/broker should sign a declaration that they understand the requirements and will comply with them.

<!-- image -->

1.2.1.3 The applicant shall ensure that they have been trained/made aware/informed of the requirements to maintain the product integrity status of these certified materials by an approved consultant or trainer to the MarinTrust programme.

Full Compliance: There is full documentary evidence that all agents/brokers have been trained by an approved trainer /consultant to the current MarinTrust standard

## Additional Notes

Approved consultant or trainer/training provider is the appointed individual by the applicant that has a good and clear understanding of the marine ingredients processing activities and the current version of the MarinTrust Chain of Custody Standard.

- 1.3 A batch/lot record of all MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients is fully maintained.

Full Compliance: Batch/lot record of all MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients is fully maintained.

## Additional Notes

A batch/lot record is required for the traceability verification test (see clause 2.5 requirements) and volume reconciliation and will support in fraud mitigation from duplication or substitution.

- 1.3.1 The batch/lot record shall contain the following information;
- · Supplier name
- · Supplier unique MarinTrust certificate number
- · Volume of MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients received from each supplier.

## The following clauses are Derogated

- 1.3.1.1 The batch/lot record shall contain the following information; (DEROGATION CLAUSE)
- · Key Data Element (KDE) information on the source fishery for whole fish to include, fishing vessel(s), species, catch area and date of landing
- · Key Data Element (KDE) information on source processing factory for by-product trimmings to include factory name, species and date of processing.

<!-- image -->

Full Compliance: Supplier details, volumes of product, and KDE information is comprehensive and appears to have been entered correctly.

## Additional Notes

It is important to record this data as it can be used to document where and how much material the applicant is using to a) ensure that a credible statement and assurance can be given to their customer and b) can be used to mitigate potential acts of fraudulent behaviour through duplication or substitution

If traders are used within the supply chain, addition information may or will need to be sourced to see if this link in the chain undertook any blending operations of the fish meal or fish oil batches to meet with a customer's bespoke requirements. If blending has occurred, the raw material inputs should be able to be traced back to source.

If a KDE records system is adopted, then a lot of this standard could be streamlined into a verification of data input into a third-party digital platform. Use the KDE definitions as described in the Global Seafood Traceability Dialogue GDST

This clause's KDE subcomponents have been derogated as ones that shall allow an applicant a complete certification cycle from their initial certification to this new standard only, to be completed, prior to it been rated for conformance to this MarinTrust CoC Standard. The effected applicant shall ensure they have an effective action plan in place, to provide documentary evidence to prove they are making measurable progress to full conformity to this clause and all its subcomponents within this certification cycle.

- 1.4 The applicant shall have a documented product management system in  place to demonstrate how MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients are segregated and labelled from non-certified product during all the processes within the Applicant's organisation.

Full Compliance: The applicant has a demonstrably effective product management system in place to keep labelled MarinTrust product segregated from marine ingredients that are produced from non-approved material

## Additional Notes

Also see requirements for clauses 2.1 and 2.2. The product management system will be appropriate to the context of the organisation. If for example the organisation only ever deals with MarinTrust compliant products, then this could be a specific document/ statement.

If the organisation deals with multiple product lines of similar non-compliant product the organisation will have to document in their product management system how MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients are kept segregated and labelled from non-compliant products, paying particular attention to key handing points (see subclauses for 2.1 and 2.2) where risk of misidentification / substitution could occur.

<!-- image -->

- 1.5 The applicant shall have in place an effectively implemented procedure to deal with any non-conformances arising from a failure of the marine ingredients product management system stated in 1.4, which may result in MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients being mixed with non-compliant material.

Full Compliance: The applicant will have a procedure in their product management system on how to deal with the case where a loss of traceability or eligibility of MarinTrust compliant material has occurred. This procedure shall include a full root cause analysis as to why this non-conforming product occurred.

## Additional Notes

The applicants CB (see clause 1.6.3) and customer (see clause 1.6.4) will be notified in the event of a non-conforming product procedure being activated.

This will usually entail the requirement to have an effective quarantine system in place for any product that was found to be outside the scope of this standard or is suspected to be due to a loss of identification and traceability.

If a non-conforming product procedure has been activated the applicant can demonstrate that this was implemented effectively.

The non-conforming product procedure would ideally be captured in the applicant's product management system.

If a non-conforming product procedure has been activated previously the applicant can show that they have implemented this effectively (though see subclauses 1.6.1 - 1.6.4).

- 1.6 Any Corrective Action Plans resulting from a non-conforming products procedure shall be accurately documented and shall include a root cause analysis
- Full Compliance: Corrective Action Plans have a root cause analysis and have been accurately documented.

OR

No non-conforming product procedure activated.

## Additional Notes

Some of sub-clauses 1.6.1 - 1.6.4 may not be relevant if the applicant has not been required to instigate a non-conforming products procedure. Any previous non-conformances that the applicant has raised should not be flagged as an NC for the purpose of this audit if the applicant can demonstrate how these NCs were acted on, and safeguards put in place to reduce the risk of a similar NC occurring in the future.

<!-- image -->

- 1.6.1 Corrective Action plans shall identify authorised responsible personnel to handle the remedial changes required, based on their severity or risk.
- Full Compliance: Authorised responsible personnel identified based on the risk level of the non-compliance identified.

OR

No non-conforming product procedure activated.

## Additional Notes

Responsible personnel need to be identified so somebody has ownership of the remedial changes within the Corrective Action Plan.

- 1.6.2 All remedial changes shall be part of a corrective action plan to mitigate these incidents happening again in future and shall be time specified.

Full Compliance: Remedial changes are clearly stated and time bound. They are shown to be part of a plan to ensure these incidents are mitigated against in future.

OR

No non-conforming product procedure activated.

## Additional Notes

Any remedial changes will inform improvements made to the product management system (clause 1.4) and/ or non-conforming product procedure (clause 1.5) to ensure similar incidents are mitigated in future.

- 1.6.3 The applicant shall notify their certification body within 24 hours of a product recall being actioned as result of this non-conforming product procedure being activated.

Full Compliance: The applicant will have a procedure in their management system on the product recall requirements for MarinTrust certified marine ingredients. In this procedure, there will be a list of contacts that should be informed and one of these will need to be the certification body that awards them their MarinTrust certificate. The time frame for informing the certification body (i.e. within 24 hours ) shall be stated within this procedure.

<!-- image -->

- 1.6.4 The applicant shall inform any customer affected by a non-conforming MarinTrust product immediately, and no later than 24 hours following detection.
- Full Compliance: Customer has been informed within 24 hours of an issue being detected.

OR

Non-conforming product procedure activated.

## Additional Notes

Ideally the customer should be notified as soon as possible so they do not inadvertently claim that the product is MarinTrust certified.

- 1.7 All records relating to the execution of the non-conforming product procedure shall be retained for a period of at least 3 years.

Full Compliance: The applicant will have a procedure that requires all records for non-conforming products to be kept for three years in their management system. The records can either be in a hard or electronic format. The auditor should take a sample of records to confirm that this procedure is being adhered to.

## Additional Notes

This is standard good practice. Where a Minor Non-Conformity is raised due to records not being maintained for a sufficiently long duration. In these circumstances, the Minor Non-Conformity will remain Minor as long as records continue to be built up. This is to reflect the impossibility of creating 3 years of records in 1 year.

- 1.8 The applicant shall have a HACCP system in place to protect the integrity of products being produced within their operation.

Full Compliance: The HACCP system is appropriate to the specific circumstances at the facilities under assessment (i.e. is the manufactured product for human or animal consumption?).

## Additional Notes

Note that the requirements of this clause may not be required for organisations that are not undertaking any processing (e.g. traders).

<!-- image -->

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) evaluates the entire production process step by step from delivery intake to packaging and transport of the completed product. During the HACCP any stages where the product could be subject to physical, microbiological or chemical contamination are identified. Measures are put in place for those deemed critical (i.e. temperature controls, cleaning etc.) and these are regularly monitored to ensure that the end product is safe for human consumption.

If  an  applicant  has  a  GFSI  certification  the  auditor  shall  check  to  see  what  areas  are  covered  within  these  certification  requirements  to  help  prove compliance with this standard clause.

- 1.8.1 The applicant shall have a TACCP/VACCP system in place to protect the integrity of products being produced within their operation if intended for direct human consumption.

Full Compliance: The TACCP/VACCP system is appropriate to the specific circumstances at the facilities under assessment (i.e. is the manufactured product for human consumption?).

## Additional Notes

Note that the requirements of this clause may not be required for organisations that are not undertaking any processing (e.g. traders).

Threat Assessment Critical Control Point (TACCP) is concerned with the prevention of deliberate and intentional food fraud . This can take the form of substitution of ingredients, passing off of one foodstuff for another, false or misleading statements for economic gain that could impact public health, product tampering, fake or incorrect labelling etc.

Vulnerability Assessment Critical Control Point (VACCP) identifies how vulnerable various points in the supply chain are to the threat of economically motivated adulteration.

If  an  applicant has a GFSI certification the auditor shall check to see what areas are covered within these certification requirements to help prove compliance with this standard clause.

Some facilities will now have BASC (Business Alliance for Secure Commerce) certification which should also provide evidence of compliance with the intent of this clause

<!-- image -->

## SECTION 2 - Traceability Verification and Labelling

- 2.1 MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients, or the finished product, shall be labelled or otherwise identified in a manner that ensures traceability is maintained during the following key traceability steps MarinTrust:

Full compliance: Applicant ensures that MarinTrust compliant materials and finished products are identifiable at all stages outlined in clauses 2.1.1 - 2.1.8 with required documentation in place.

## Additional Notes

Documentation received with certified products needs to clearly identify the product as certified. This may include the following:

- · delivery notes,
- · invoices,
- · bills of lading, or
- · official documents in an electronic format from the supplier.

Information captured upon receipt pertaining to the batch/lot record (clause 1.3.1) must not be lost during production to ensure that full traceability can be maintained (clause 2.3). If a supplier uses an internal system (such as barcodes or product codes) to uniquely identify certified products on documents, the applicant must understand the supplier's description in order to confirm the product is certified.

Note- some production codes used in facilities may not be used on the finished product. If this is the case care must be taken to ensure that the sales invoice or a purchase order/number etc can be linked back to these production codes to ensure that full traceability can be established Additionally, it is recommended that certified products are identifiable as certified on the physical product as well as on the accompanying traceability records. This can be done by placing a sign or label on the package, container, or pallet. Organisations can use a variety of methods to identify certified products, including acronyms (e.g., 'MarinTrust'), the CoC certification code, or another internal system of identification.

Where it is impossible or impractical to label physical products, the applicant will need to demonstrate how the product can be linked with associated traceability or inventory records that specify the certified status

Full compliance: The applicant maintains accurate up-to-date records of quantities/ volumes of fishmeal/ fish oil /finished product bought and sold across their entire product range.

## Additional Notes

To obtain the percentage of MarinTrust certified material inputs used in the applicant's operation, calculate the annual sum of certified MarinTrust marine ingredients inputs divided by total Annual sum of all marine ingredient materials used. This shall need to be reported to MarinTrust so that % of certified MarinTrust compliant material sold in the final product cannot be exceeded, therefore mitigating against potential fraud through duplication or substitution.

If no records of quantities/ volumes have been kept, the applicant will have 3 calendar months if they are a new applicant and 1 calendar month if an existing client to ensure that they have a procedure in place to ensure that they start building up records prior to the next audit. If this is the case, this will be the focus of the subsequent surveillance audit.

2.5 The applicant shall conduct a documented verification test of their product management system across the entire range of MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients or finished product by batch/lot number or volume produced.

Full compliance: Following the Traceability Test, complete traceability can be demonstrated following batch/lot numbers for the entire range of MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients and finished products. If a mass balance exercise is undertaken the volume/ weight of seafood in MarinTrust compliant finished products does not exceed the weight of MarinTrust compliant raw materials.

## Additional Notes

The applicant should display the findings from the traceability test in the Traceability Test Template and if appropriate a Mass Balance exercise should be undertaken (see tabs in supplementary spreadsheet entitled Traceability verification test - guidance and templates ).

The MASS Balance exercise is particularly important if the factory is a processor that also processes non-certified fish products that are of similar nature to the certified fish products. This to provide assurance that the volume/ weight of seafood in MarinTrust compliant finished products does not exceed the volume/ weight of MarinTrust compliant input materials.

2.5.1 This verification test shall be carried out at least once per year with a gap no greater than 12 months between tests, and shall include a traceability challenge both from receipt to despatch and from despatch back to receipt

Full compliance: The applicant can demonstrate that the verification test has been carried out at least once per year, and that a trace forward (receipt to dispatch) and trace backwards (dispatch to receipt) traceability test has been carried out for the full range of MarinTrust compliant products.

Full compliance: Non-conformities and corrective action plans are fully documented by the applicant in the template in the Non-Compliance tab in the supplementary spreadsheet entitled Traceability verification test - guidance and templates. OR

No non-conformities were raised during the applicant's verification test.

## Additional Notes

It will be responsibility of the applicant to ensure that non-conformities from the verification test will be corrected. The intent here is to enable the applicant to routinely test their product management system and make improvements if necessary. This is considered to be industry good practice. Note that the applicant will not receive any NC from the auditor for identifying non-conformities during the verification test as long as they can demonstrate that NCs raised during the verification test have been corrected. This will encourage the applicant to be transparent.

If no non-conformities were raised by the applicant and the auditor is happy that a comprehensive verification test has been carried out, this clause and sub-clauses 2.6.1 - 2.6.2 will not be relevant.

- 2.6.1 Corrective Action Plans shall identify authorised responsible personnel to handle the remedial changes required

Full compliance: Authorised responsible personnel are identified to handle any remedial changes.

OR

No non-conformities were raised during the applicant's verification test.

## Additional Notes

Responsible personnel need to be identified so somebody has ownership of the remedial changes.

This should also inform improvements to the non-conforming products procedure (see clauses 1.5 and 1.6) to mitigate the risk of similar nonconformities being raised in the future.

- 2.7 Where processing or packing / repacking occurs, records shall allow conversion rates for the finished product outputs from MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients inputs over any given batch or time period to be calculated.

Full compliance: Records of quantities/ volumes of input materials and processed or packaged products are comprehensive to allow conversion rates for the finished product outputs to be calculated. The % of certified MarinTrust compliant material in the final product cannot exceed that of the input materials.

## Additional Notes

For guidance on calculating conversion rates please refer to the MASS Balance tab in supplementary spreadsheet entitled Traceability verification test guidance and templates.

If no records of quantities/ volumes/quality parameters have been kept, the applicant will have 3 calendar months if they are a new applicant and 1 calendar month if an existing client to ensure that they have a procedure in place to ensure that they start building up records prior to the next audit. If this is the case, this will be the focus of the subsequent surveillance audit

- 2.7.1 Conversion rates for processing of the finished product that has used MarinTrust compliant marine ingredients shall be justifiable, and verifiable

Full compliance: Conversion rates have been properly calculated and are verifiable and justifiable.

- Full compliance: All traceability and identification records have been kept for a minimum of 3 years.

## Additional Notes

If a minor Non-Conformity is raised due to records not being maintained for a sufficiently long duration. In these circumstances, the Minor NonConformity will remain Minor as long as records continue to be built up. This is to reflect the impossibility of creating 3 years of records in 1 year. If no traceability and identification records have been kept, the applicant will have 3 calendar months if they are a new applicant and 1 calendar month if an existing client to ensure that they have a procedure in place to ensure that they start building up records prior to the next audit. If this is the case, this will be the focus of the subsequent surveillance audit.

2.9.1 All records used to provide evidence of compliance to this MarinTrust CoC Standard shall be accurate, legible and unadulterated.

Full compliance: All records are accurate, legible and unadulterated.

If subcontractors are used, they will be part of the applicant's certification to this standard. Prior to the audit of the applicant's facilities the applicant should have requested any subcontractor(s) to will be part of the audit plan and will need to assess for compliance against the MarinTrust CoC Standard. CoC audits for subcontractor facilities would be co-ordinated by the CB, this to ensure that the subcontracting facility has been audited and found to be compliant with the standard prior to the audit of the applicant's facilities.

In the case of a trader that buys fishmeal or fish oil from a MarinTrust certified factory,

- a) the purchased fishmeal or fish oil is kept at the storage facility of the certified plant or at a storage that has MarinTrust CoC. Only paperwork is required to prove that the volume reconciliation of compliant MarinTrust material is accurate or in
- b) if the purchased fishmeal or fish oil is kept in another storage facility that is not MarinTrust this will need to be audited to ensure that the MarinTrust compliant material is not being mixed with non MarinTrust material.

## Definitions

## Chain of Custody (FAO derived Definition):

The set of measures which is designed to guarantee that the fishmeal and fish oil product put on the market and bearing the MarinTrust logo is really a product of designated origin and coming from the certified factory concerned. These measures thus cover both the tracking/traceability of the product all  along  the  processing,  distribution  and  marketing  chain,  as  well  as  the  proper  tracking  of  the documentation and control of the quantity concerned.3

Agent: The agent works on behalf of either the seller or the buyer and facilitates the transaction (sale or purchase). The agent does not take ownership and can be seen as an alternative to having inhouse sales or purchase employees, they typically get paid a percentage of the activity. No activity, no cost.

Applicant: A company or group of companies in the supply chain that has formally applied to meet the Chain of Custody Standard through the formal Application Form.

Broker: A broker brings the buyer and seller together and gets a commission from either party or both. He/she does not take ownership. If the broker takes ownership, he/she becomes a principal and is thus a trader. A broker needs a good understanding of the products and applications and needs to have a good network. He/she does not need to have money, as he/she does not need to finance the goods, as he/she does not take ownership.

Certificate Holder: A company in the supply chain that has been formally Certified by the Certification Body as complying with the MarinTrust Standard and/or the Chain of Custody standard requirements.

Certification Bodies: The bodies appointed by MarinTrust to audit, assess and monitor compliance of applicants and certificate holders under the MarinTrust Programme.

Certified Claim: A claim made by a certificate holder approved for use and licensed by the Standard Owner.

Chain  of  Custody  Standard: The  list  of  requirements  that  the  Applicant  must  meet  to  claim Certification to the Chain of Custody Standard and /or use the Certified Claim.

Key Data Element (KDE): Data input required to successfully trace a product and/or its ingredients through all relevant CTEs.

Marine ingredients: Mainly fishmeal and fish oil derived from forage fish, but also marine organisms such as fish, krill, shellfish and algae

MarinTrust Branding: The name/s and logo/s as outlined in the MarinTrust Brand Guidelines

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

MarinTrust Brand Guidelines: The brand guidelines of MarinTrust, as set out in MarinTrust Brand Guidelines Document.

MarinTrust Certified Factory: An applicant factory who have successfully been certified as compliant with the MarinTrust Standard requirements.

MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Certified: An Applicant company or group of companies who have successfully been certified as compliant with the MarinTrust Chain of Custody standard requirements.

MarinTrust  Statement: A  statement  that  accurately  describes  the  User's  certification  under  the MarinTrust Programme

Potential  Applicant: A  company  or  group  of  companies  in  the  supply  chain  that  are  considering applying for Chain of Custody Standard certification.

Stage: A handling / transfer point in the supply chain e.g. Packing, Processing, Distribution, Sales.

Trader: Person or company that buys and sells products. The trader has legal ownership of products, receives invoices and issues invoices and receives the full package of paper documentation. A trader may  touch  the  product  (trader  with  warehouse/storage  tank)  or  a  trader  may  merely  trade  the product  without  physically  receiving  the  product,  as  the  product  typically  goes  directly  from  the manufacturer to a manufacturing plant. The trader needs to; have a good network, understand the market, finance the purchase and sales of products and, be familiar with the international transport of goods in order to find the best and the cheapest means of transport.

Seafood Processing Standard - Enhanced Social Module

Issue Number 1.0

Effective Date: 05-NOV-2025 Published Date: 04-NOV-2024

Status

Approved

## A Introduction

The intent of this module is to provide a more robust set of social accountability clauses under an audit framework  which  aligns  with  requirements  of  the  Consumer  Goods  Forum's  Sustainable  Supply  Chain Initiative  (SSCI)  benchmark  for  manufacturing/processing.  This  Enhanced  Social  Module  has  been developed to be used by seafood processing facilities where a more in-depth social auditing approach is required to meet their social accountability expectations.

The Enhanced Social Module will be audited concurrently with the Core Seafood Processing Standard 6.0, unless a  facility  selects  to  add  this  scope  to  an  existing  SPS  certification.  When  the  Enhanced  Social Module  is  selected,  the  entirety  of  the  SPS  audit,  including  the  Core  standard  and  any  other  modules selected, shall be conducted on an unannounced basis. Auditors conducting the Enhanced Social Module shall be experienced social auditors who are at the APSCA Certified Social Compliance Auditor (CSCA) level. A CSCA auditor shall not be required for any other components of the audit outside the Enhanced Social Module.

The CSCA auditors will conduct detailed interviews with the facility's workforce to ascertain compliance. This additional layer of scrutiny will provide enhanced credibility and social assurance for facilities and stakeholders that require a more focused and rigorous assessment of a worker's employment and living conditions.

## B  Scope

This standard applies to enhanced social criteria for seafood processing facilities that are, or in the process of, becoming certified to Global Seafood Alliance SPS. Assessments to this module will be conducted by CSCA (BAP Category 8) auditors to be valid.

## Identity Preserve Model Overview

## Who and what is it for?

This document provides an overview of all key aspects of the Identity Preserve Model (ID Model) to help certificate holders and applicants to understand the steps and their roles and responsibilities.

The ID Model is for certificate holders and applicants to the Chain of Custody who wish to sponsor a one (or more) production facilities who are unable to gain MarinTrust certification independently, these are known as:

CoC Sponsor: refers to the CoC facility that wants to sponsor a marine ingredient producer.

Sponsored production facility: refers to the supplying production facility, which is subcontracted by the CoC sponsor to produce marine ingredient on their behalf, that is sponsored by a CoC sponsor.

## Key steps

For full details of the process please refer to document A7. An overview of the key steps of the ID Model Procedure can be found as follows:

## Step 1: Application

The first step is to apply to the Programme under the ID model as follows:

- · The CoC sponsor will submit the relevant application forms to MarinTrust. This will include the
- o The current MarinTrust application form the sponsored subcontractor facility:
- o The current CoC application form if the CoC sponsor is a new applicant, or the current CoC
- · Upon payment of all relevant administration fees, the approved application forms then shared by MarinTrust with the relevant Certification Body (CB)

NOTE: Production facilities may only be sponsored:

- o by one CoC sponsor at a time
- o for one full certification cycle (3 years)

## Step 2: Assessment and audit

For the purposes of the ID model, the following chronology is outlined:

- · All fishery and by-product assessments required are conducted before the production facility audit. The facility may then undergo initial MarinTrust audit.
- · If the CoC sponsor is:
- o a new applicant the facility will undergo the MarinTrust CoC audit after at least one production facility (if sponsoring multiple ) has had a successful audit outcome. 1
- o currently MarinTrust CoC certified facilities will undergo audit in line with the existing audit cycle.

NOTE: All assessment and audit processes are carried out in line with normal due process - please refer to document A3 and A4 for further information.

## Step 3: Certification (upon successful audit)

After successful compliance of the both the sponsor and sponsored, the CB will issue the relevant certification as follows:

- · Only the CoC sponsor will receive a MarinTrust certificate.
- · The sponsored production facility will not receive a MarinTrust certificate. Instead, they will be included in the CoC certificate of the Sponsor.

To  maintain  certification   as  part  of  the  ID  Model  all  participants  are  required  to  pass  annual 2 surveillance audits.

## Step 4: Transferring to independent certification

Once a production facility has been sponsored for one certification cycle (3 years) they must apply for independent certification by submitting the MarinTrust application form at least 6 months prior to the expiry of the certification period.

Sponsored production facilities may want to apply for independent certification before the end of the certification cycle, in this case at least 6 months prior to its next due surveillance audit they must:

- · Notify its CoC Sponsor and MarinTrust of its intention
- · Submit the MarinTrust application form

And will have the following 2 options:

- 1. Immediate transfer: the sponsored facility will no longer be considered as part of the Identity Preserve Model with immediate effect.
- 2. Transition transfer: sponsored facility will remain part of the Identity Preserve Model until the next due surveillance date.

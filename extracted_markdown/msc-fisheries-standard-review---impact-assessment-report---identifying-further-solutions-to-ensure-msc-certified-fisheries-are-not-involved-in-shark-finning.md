## 1 Impact Assessment Report - Overview

## 1.1 Impact Assessment Framework

The aim of impact assessment is to provide clear information on the impacts of the options developed to  sort  out  the  policy  issues  identified  in  the  project  inception.  It  serves  as  a  basis  for  comparing options  against  one  another  and  against  the  business-as-usual  scenario,  and  identify  a  preferred option if possible. It does not replace decision-making but is used as a tool to support the decisionmaking process and underpin evidenced based decision-making; increasing transparency, making trade-offs visible and reducing bias.

Impact assessment should help to:

- · Specify how proposed options will tackle the identified issues and meet objectives
- · Identify direct and indirect impacts, and how they occur
- · Assess impacts in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
- · Help find perverse or unintended consequences before they occur.
- · Where possible, make risks and uncertainties known.

This is achieved by following MSC's Impact Assessment Framework that outlines when and how to undertake Impact Assessment. This ensures an efficient, systematic and consistent approach to policy development to  underpin  a  responsive,  robust  and  credible  program.  In  particular,  the  Impact Assessment Framework defines the different types of impact (see below) and a suite of methodologies best suited to assessing each type.

The impact types used in the Impact Assessment are defined as follows:

- 1. Effectiveness: The extent to which the change is deemed likely to be successful in producing the desired results and resolving the issue(s) originally identified.
- 2. Acceptability: The extent that the change is considered tolerable or allowable, such that the MSC program is perceived as credible and legitimate by stakeholders.
- 3. Feasibility: The practicality of a proposed change and the extent to which a change is likely to be successfully implemented by fisheries within a given setting and time period.
- 4. Accessibility &amp; Retention: The extent to which the change affects the ability of fisheries (both currently certified and those potentially entering assessment in the future) to achieve and maintain certification (i.e. changes in scores, conditions and pass rates).
- 5. Simplification: The extent to which the change simplifies and does not further complicate the Standard such that it can be easily and consistently understood and applied.
- 6. Auditability: The extent to which the change can objectively be assessed by Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) and Accreditation Services International (ASI) to determine whether the specified requirements are fulfilled, and CABs can provide scores.

The Impact Assessment report presents the results of this process, whereby each of the options for proposed changes to the Fisheries Standard are tested to understand their potential effects across the six defined impact types.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Contradictions exist between the MSC Board of Trustees (BoT) intent for a zero-tolerance approach to shark finning, the existing requirements and the MSC Theory of Change (ToC). This has resulted in

inconsistencies in scoring by Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) which poses a credibility risk to the MSC.

More specifically, the Fisheries Standard Review (FSR) project 'Identifying further solutions to ensure MSC certified fisheries are not involved in shark finning' is split into three core topics responding to the following problem statements: firstly, MSC does not define the term 'shark' in the context of the requirements which leads to inconsistent consideration of species spanning the Chondrichthyes class. Secondly, a zero tolerance policy as mandated by the BoT works to inadvertently disincentivise good monitoring and reporting, where detection of a single shark finning incident can lead to suspension, therefore MSC's existing requirements are not clearly delivering a zero tolerance policy nor are they incentivising improvements in monitoring. Thirdly, best practice has evolved since the publication of the Fisheries Standard v2.0, therefore the existing requirements do not reflect these advances globally and need revision.

To address these issues the project has aimed to answer the following key questions:

- 1) Should MSC define which species are covered under the term 'shark'?
- 2) How can MSC incentivise fisheries improvements aligned with the MSC Theory of Change and simultaneously deliver a zero tolerance policy on shark finning?
- 3) How can the shark finning requirements deliver the needed confidence and transparency that shark finning is not occurring in MSC certified fisheries aligned with advances in best practice?

## 1.3 Objectives

Broad &amp; specific objectives of the FSR review, options development, and associated impact testing:

- 1) Clarify the MSC's intent through a revision to requirements and guidance
- a) Clarify what is meant by the term 'shark' to ensure consistent scoring of shark finning in MSC assessments
- 2) Ensure requirements are structured effectively to clarify and deliver a zero-tolerance approach and incentives for fisheries in the program to improve fisheries monitoring and reporting
- a) At a minimum, the requirements should be revised to ensure that monitoring and reporting are not disincentivised (recognising that any improvements system (eg. SG60 - 100) aligned with MSC's ToC may be contrary to achieving a zero-tolerance policy intent on shark finning).
- 3) Revise requirements to ensure that best practice in management for the prevention of shark finning and best practice in MCS is reflected in order to improve confidence and transparency that shark finning is not occurring in MSC fisheries.
- a) Ensure requirements deliver confidence in a zero-tolerance approach through reflecting 'best practice' evolution of specific policies related to the prevention of shark finning.
- b) Ensure requirements deliver confidence in a zero-tolerance approach through reflecting advances in 'best practice' for monitoring, control and surveillance mechanisms and coverage.
- c) Ensure revisions to requirements are proportionate to the scale and intensity of the fishing operations.

## 1.4 Options considered

Impact testing has been conducted in a phased approach, with a wide range of options considered initially and trimmed down based on their feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness. The full range of options that were considered for the impact assessment in the initial stage are provided in Table 1, illustrating how these options have evolved through the impact testing process (combined options).

Detailed impact assessment results are provided for each topic in Section 2: Detailed Impact Assessment.

## 1.5 Summary of Options and Impacts

## 1.5.1 Options Assessment

The options discussed below are those that were combined after the first stage of impact assessment (Table 1).

## 1.5.2 Topic 1 - define the term 'shark'

There is currently no definition for what the MSC means by 'shark' in the context of a shark finning ban which leads to inconsistent assessments. Best practice is not well defined in this area, with management agencies defining sharks in different ways or in some cases not defining them at all.

## Summary of Options

Option 0, the business as usual scenario, does not define the term 'shark'. This means that ambiguity would remain, leading assessment teams to apply different definitions and potentially assessing a different range of species depending on the management jurisdiction under assessment.

This could mean that in some cases vulnerable species beyond the group 'selachians' (true sharks) would not be assessed. This could include shark-like batoids (eg. Guitarfish), which are among the most valuable and sought after species for the fin trade with their conservation status critical as a result. These species would not be consistently assessed under the finning SIs under Option 0, thus hindering our conservation objectives as an organization and likely not fulfilling our stakeholder expectations as an ecolabel.

Option 1 proposes a new definition of 'shark' which would cover 'all chondrichthyans' unless otherwise stated by the relevant management agency. This option accommodates management arrangements where appropriate definitions of 'shark' already exist, but fills a gap for fisheries operating in jurisdictions where definitions are absent. Stakeholders are likely to be polarised. This may be more acceptable to NGOs than fisheries generally. It is expected to be largely feasible for fisheries in the program, however, it may somewhat limit accessibility to new fisheries (of the six regions in our preassessment database, two do not have a working definition of shark).

Option 2 proposes an MSC bespoke definition of 'shark' to cover the most vulnerable species at risk of overexploitation from the fin trade, e.g. Selachimorpha (all extant sharks) and Rhinopristiformes (all guitarfishes, sawfishes etc). Taking a stand to define 'shark' in this way will demonstrate MSC's commitment to our conservation objectives to protect vulnerable species at risk of overexploitation from this practice, and improve monitoring and management for a wider subset of species than just selachians. This option will be the most effective at improving clarity and consistency in MSC assessments. As this sets the conservation objectives higher than some management authorities, this stance from MSC may drive improvements not only within the program but also in management of sharks globally. Clarifying our intent in this way will enhance credibility and consistency.

## Comparison of options

Option 2 (MSC bespoke definition) provides the most consistent resolution to the issue, enabling better auditability, clarity of intent and enhanced conservation outcomes leading to improved credibility and eNGO relationships. Best practice is not well defined in this area, with different management agencies adopting different definitions, therefore there is no 'one size fits all' here. This option covers the species most at risk of finning, which will likely be acceptable to eNGO stakeholders, without having adverse implications for the management of other fisheries with less conservation issues from the fin trade (e.g. skate fisheries). Option 0 and 1 are considered less effective as they both lead to inconsistent outcomes similar to those experienced by endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species designation which is being addressed in this FSR.

## 1.5.3 Topic 2 - deliver a zero tolerance intent

The BoT issued a statement in 2011 that shark finning shall not take place in MSC certified fisheries. Thus any incidence of shark finning in a fishery risks the suspension of the fishery.

## Summary of options

Option 0, the business as usual scenario, would mean that shark finning continues to be assessed with different levels of confidence depending on the SG level (with higher levels of external validation and different policies in place providing increasing confidence from SG60 - SG100). From a structural perspective, this scenario effectively disincentivises good monitoring and reporting because a single detection and reporting of a shark finning incident means the removal of the vessel implicated in that incident. Increases in likelihood from SG60 - SG100 implies that there could be shark finning tolerated to a certain degree, which is perceived to contradict the MSC's zero-tolerance policy.

Option 1 proposes a change in the structure of the scoring guideposts, reducing them from three to a single SG at the 60 level. This could be implemented with or without a risk based approach to

evidence requirements. This approach essentially treats shark finning as a scope issue. It means all fisheries are either held to a single high bar at SG60, or a risk based approach to evidence is applied to ensure that high risk fisheries are held to a higher bar for evidence needed to demonstrate that they are not engaged in shark finning. There was strong support for a risk based approach in the consultation, and a recognition that our existing requirements do not fully demonstrate a zero tolerance policy. This option links to Option 3 under Topic 3 below.

Option 2 proposes to retain the existing scoring system but apply a risk based approach to evidence requirements and increase the levels of external validation required at all scoring guideposts. There was support from stakeholders to retain the current scoring system whereby fisheries improve from SG60 - SG100.  However, most eNGOs were only in favour of retaining the current scoring system if Fins Naturally Attached (FNA) policies were mandated for all fisheries, with increased scores permissible on the basis of increased levels of external verification from SG60 - SG100. The question of policies and best practice is addressed in Topic 3.

Option 3 proposes to assess shark finning under Principle 3 (P3). This was considered by a consultant and was previously considered in the development of v1.3 of the shark finning requirements. It was considered that this option may reduce the granularity of the current assessment process and thus could be perceived as a lowering of the bar. Considering it as a compliance issue was generally favoured as an option by fishery partners in the consultation.

## Comparison of options

Option 1 (a single SG at 60) offers the most straightforward, consistent and acceptable way of demonstrating a zero tolerance approach. A risk based approach to evidence requirements was also acceptable to all stakeholders to enable the assessment of high risk fisheries to a slightly higher bar for this scoring issue. This is heavily linked to the evidence requirements project and as such there are significant dependencies on those outcomes to deliver this project. Options 0 and 2 are similar, and whilst they theoretically promote improvements aligned with our ToC, they do not clearly demonstrate a zero tolerance approach to the issue which should essentially be a straightforward scope question at SG60. Promoting improvement is challenging for this project as a zero tolerance policy, effectively disincentivizes improvements in monitoring as it could lead to more detection and consequent suspension of a fleet thus the need for a single SG at the minimum entry level.

## 1.5.4 Topic 3 - reflect best practice

Best practice and adoption of Fins Naturally Attached (FNA) policies has increased since the effective date of v2.0 of the Fisheries Standard.

## Summary of options

Option 0, the business as usual scenario, means continuing to allow 'cutting of fins on board' and 'processing on board' at SG60, and also 'processing on board' at both SG80 and SG100 with varying degrees of external validation required. Stakeholders (eNGOs in particular) state that this is unacceptable and does not reflect best practice. This option does not reflect any of the advances and uptake seen in the adoption of FNA policies globally and would not be acceptable to the wide range of extremely critical and influential NGOs campaigning on this issue. These campaigns would continue with considerable reputational and market damage to the label if this option is taken forward.

Option 1 proposes a change to the Standard requirements such that a FNA policy is optional at the SG60 level, in addition to the other existing requirements which permit the cutting of fins and processing of sharks under specific circumstances. The cutting of fins and processing on board would be considered high risk activities and would require higher levels of external validation

relative to fisheries that operate under a FNA policy. These scoring options would be the same at all SGs apart from the external validation levels would increase with each SG level.

Option 2 proposes a change to the requirements whereby a FNA policy would be mandated at SG60, 80 and 100 but the levels of external validation would increase with each scoring guidepost. This would be inaccessible for a number of well managed fisheries that conduct processing on board, but this would be widely accepted by eNGOs.

Option 3 uses Option 1 in Topic 2 outlined above, and proposes to adopt a single scoring guidepost (SG60) mandating an FNA policy is in place unless the fishery is subject to a formal exemption through the appropriate management agency. Any justification for the inclusion of an exemption must include documented evidence for why and under what conditions the management agency is permitting to process or cut fins on board. For any exemptions, the evidence would need to provide the same certainty that shark finning is not occurring as would exist from an FNA policy. This option means that fisheries with adequate alternative policies will not be forced to adopt FNA. This puts the onus back onto management bodies, whilst creating a default MSC position that could drive the Theory of Change with respect to improvements in management.

## Comparison of options

Option 3 (single scoring guidepost at SG60) enables the delivery of a zero tolerance approach, and a precautionary approach to shark finning which has been the focus of significant eNGO campaigns for the last few years. This option acknowledges the increased uptake in FNA policies but also reflects that management agencies do not always apply full FNA policies when they have been enacted (e.g. exemptions are often applied under specific circumstances). This option enables well managed fisheries to access the program but provides a precautionary default position that where the management agency has not got the process in place, a default FNA policy must be adopted in order to pass MSC certification. This reduces the risk of shark finning occurring in MSC certified fisheries but enables the MSC to keep pace with changes in management over the longer term.

## 2 Detailed Impact Assessment

A preliminary impact assessment was completed for all plausible options, looking at the impact types: Effectiveness, Feasibility, Acceptability, Accessibility and retention, Auditability and Simplification. Further impact testing then narrowed the focus onto the specific impact types: Effectiveness, Acceptability, Feasibility, and Accessibility and retention for all three topics, as these were of most concern for the project's goals.

This impact assessment is based on expert judgement of the project and outreach leads, feedback provided by outreach co-readers, and has largely been informed by a consultant report by Amie Brautigam, commissioned by the MSC in 2020, as well as the outcomes of a public consultation held in July 2020. Information regarding the public consultation is available in the Consultation Summary Report.

## 2.1 Topic 1 - Define the term 'shark' for finning requirements

## 2.1.1 Background

Within the MSC requirements, the term 'shark' is not defined. Therefore, it is up to assessment teams to determine the species that are included in the shark finning scoring. Informing this aspect of the impact assessment are a consultancy report that the MSC commissioned and an internal review of the species that were assessed in shark finning scoring. The consultancy demonstrated that the definitions of 'shark' that are included in shark finning legislation varied greatly. The report found:

- · Of the 21 fishing entities of the Top 40+ Global Shark-Fishing entities reviewed here that have adopted a finning ban, 12 have defined 'shark' for the purposes of the FB, while nine have not.
- · The definition of shark and shark fin has important implications, as a narrow definition (selachians) would exclude shark-like elasmobranchs such as guitarfishes and wedgefishes that have some of the most valuable fins on the international shark fin market, while a broader definition, such as including the batoids, brings skate fisheries, and their most important product, skate wings, under the finning regime (intentionally or not).

The internal review found that for assessments that scored shark finning in v1.3 and v2.0, 54% reference only the term 'shark' with the next most common being 'spiny dogfish' at 10%. All other species were either included as groups in the rationale (e.g. silky shark and oceanic whitetip) and only 2% referenced 'chondrichthyes'. The term 'elasmobranch' and references to wider species groups that included 'ghost sharks' (i.e. chimaeras) were considered in 4% of UoAs.

## Of these 4% of UoAs:

- · References to ghost sharks were not explicit in the scoring table for the fishery that interacted with these species, though they were part of the Principle 2 (P2) catch tables
- · Species of skate and ray were considered explicitly in 2 UoAs
- · Rays were considered under the FNA policy of EU fisheries under the term 'elasmobranch' in 1 UoA

Taken together, these results indicate that other elasmobranchs have been considered within the shark finning requirements, albeit infrequently and inconsistently.

## Options considered to resolve this issue are:

- 0. Business as usual
- 1. Define 'shark' as 'all chondrichthyes' unless defined by the management agency
- 2. MSC bespoke definition of 'shark' to cover the most vulnerable species at risk of overexploitation from the fin trade

The options proposed and their associated impacts are presented below sequentially, with an overall comparison of the options under Topic 1 presented at the end of this section. The impact types addressed are effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and accessibility and retention.

## 2.1.2 Option 0 - Business as usual - no definition of the term 'shark'

The following table presents the main risks and benefits anticipated from adopting Option 0 according to each impact type under consideration.

| Acceptability                | -  - | Issues with the sustainability  of certain species not  resolved  Stakeholders may see the  requirements as not all  -  Stakeholders have not raised  this issue but likely assume all  species of elasmobranch are  covered |                                                          |

## 2.1.3 Option 1 - Define 'shark' as 'all chondrichthyes' unless defined by the management agency

Best practice has not been established, and jurisdictions vary in terms of the definition they apply. This option would create an increased scrutiny of all chondrichthyans under the current requirements but also allow certain fisheries that have undertaken research into this area to be assessed under their own initiatives. Results from the consultant report were used to inform this impact assessment, alongside internal analysis of existing fisheries management arrangements and scoring of shark finning. An internal database containing information relevant to pre-assessments was also used to indicate the potential impacts for fisheries pre-certification.

## Example draft requirements:

Teams shall consider 'sharks' as 'class Chondrichthyes' unless otherwise defined by the relevant management agency for the purposes of a finning ban.

Risks and benefits of adoption Option 1 are presented in the following table for each impact type respectively.

## 2.1.4 Option 2 - MSC bespoke definition

This option could follow specific examples such as that adopted by GFCM and EU Council Regulation eg. 'elasmobranchs but excluding from 'shark fins' the pectoral fins of rays, the 'constituent part of raywings'. This option, when framed as exceptions, could present a perception or 'optics' issue with associated reputational risk for MSC, whereby MSC could be seen as 'permitting' the finning of certain species.

Alternatively, this option could change the framing to include taxonomic groups rather than omit them from the definition. It could follow a similar structure to the Key LTL requirements in Principle 1

(P1), where specific families are considered under the Key LTL requirements. For the shark definition, these taxonomic groups are proposed as:

- · Selachimorpha
- · Rhinopristiformes

These groups are proposed as it would cover all extant sharks as well as the guitarfishes/wedgefishes/sawfishes, which are among the most vulnerable groups of elasmobranch and have highly valued fins. This option would be explored further in impact assessment planned in 2021.

Risks and benefits of adopting this option are provided in the following table relative to the impact types considered.

## 2.1.5 Comparison of Options under Topic 1

To explore the feasibility and accessibility of the options proposed, a review of management arrangements for certified fisheries that had scored the shark finning requirements was conducted. A key aspect of this review was to verify how many of those management arrangements already cater for the different options being proposed. A database of existing active pre-assessments was also used to demonstrate feasibility for those regions when considering accessibility to incoming fisheries (Table 6). Regions assessed in the consultant report were also mapped out against the different options (Table 7). Of 22 regions sampled by the consultant, nine did not explicitly define the term 'shark' and thus, if MSC adopted Option 1, fisheries operating under those management regimes would have to apply the default MSC finning requirements to 'all chondrichthyes'. This would likely raise accessibility and retention concerns for those fisheries. For Option 2, 14 jurisdictions do not have definitions that would cover the taxa proposed. Therefore, if this option was adopted there would remain some accessibility and retention issues. However, it could be argued that the improvements required of fisheries to bridge the gap in management practices between a business as usual approach (option 0) to an option 2 approach, would be less onerous than that required to cover all Chondrichthyes (option 1).

Using the MSC scoring database of existing certified fisheries, thirty-five (28%) of the fisheries that scored shark finning operate within jurisdictions that have definitions that cover the proposed bespoke definition, including Selachimorpha and Rhinopristiformes.  If including the EU (21 fisheries) (where the definition of 'ray' is unclear), this proportion increases to 46%. If including RFMOs that refer to the FAO IPOA loosely (4 fisheries), then this figure increases again to 49% of existing certified fisheries.

Table 6: Accessibility of options considered under Topic 1 compared by region for preassessments. The symbol (√) signifies that the jurisdiction has a definition in place that would mean the option is feasible and accessible for fisheries in that jurisdiction whereas the symbol (X) indicates the contrary.

## 2.2 Topic 2 - Clarify zero tolerance intent

## 2.2.1 Background

This objective sits within the context of the MSC board decision that no MSC fishery should undertake shark finning. As part of a recent public consultation, one of the key questions asked of participants was whether the requirements reflected best practice and delivered the zero tolerance intent.

When asked, 'Do you think there is a need to revise the requirements related to the prevention of shark finning in the MSC Standard', ≈90% of responses indicated 'yes.' Although not a direct question with respect to zero tolerance, the sentiment from those responses suggested that the current requirements do need clarification with respect to a zero tolerance policy.

The main areas considered for impact assessment are effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and accessibility and retention.

The options considered to resolve this issue are as follows:

- 0.) Business as usual
- 1.) A single SG at 60 applied with or without a risk based approach to evidence requirements
- 2.) Retain existing scoring system but increase the levels of external validation mandated. This could be applied with or without a risk based approach to evidence requirements
- 3.) Assess shark finning as a compliance issue under P3

These options and associated impacts are presented sequentially below. The main areas for impact assessment are effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and accessibility and retention.

## 2.2.2 Option 0 - Business as usual

## 2.2.3 Option 1

Option 1 considers two approaches combined: A single scoring guidepost at SG60 (Option 1a) and a single scoring guidepost at SG60 with a risk based approach to evidence requirements (Option 1b). These options are considered separately below, however they have been combined to form Option 1.

## 2.2.3.1 Option 1a. - Apply a single scoring guidepost for shark finning at SG60 so all fisheries must apply the same specific criteria in order to pass

Example of draft requirements are presented below for illustrative purposes only.

## 2.2.3.2 Option 1b. - Apply a single scoring guidepost for shark finning at SG60 using a riskbased approach to evidence requirements so that low risk fisheries can provide less evidence than high risk fisheries

## Draft Requirements (for illustrative purposes only):

The following draft diagram outlines a potential risk assessment that could be used to triage the level of information and evidence required of a fishery to pass MSC assessment against the Shark Finning requirements. The ultimate information required would be based upon the outcome of the 'evidence requirements' work package under the P3 project Ensuring effective fisheries management systems are in place. This would determine the levels of information needed for each risk category. All details outlined below are purely illustrative and do not act as concrete proposals at this stage.

Figure 1: Draft example of risk-based decision tree that could be used to triage assessments based on risk of shark finning occurring.

A risk based approach to evidence requirements would be used in combination with the following scoring table and requirements under this option. These are examples only at this stage.

Table 11: Example draft scoring table for Option 1b (Topic 2). Note that the language of these draft scoring requirements is intended to be illustrative only. It has been drafted to help visualise the proposed changes, and will undergo considerable refinement in later stages.

| ETP species        | 2.3.2 | (f)  | It is highly likely that  shark finning is not  occurring. | Not scored | Not scored |

## Example draft Shark Finning requirements:

- · 2.4.5.x For low risk fisheries
- o Policies are in place to ensure shark finning is not occurring.
- o External Verification systems shall not be less than 5% of effort.
- · 2.4.5.y For medium risk fisheries
- o Policies are in place to ensure shark finning is not occurring.
- o External Verification systems shall not be less than 20% of effort.
- · 2.4.5.z For high risk fisheries
- o Policies are in place to ensure shark finning is not occurring.
- o External verification systems must be comprehensive such that isolated and rare events can be detected (e.g. 100% monitoring such as EM / Observers/ dockside etc.).

The risks and benefits of adopting this option are presented in the table below.

## 2.2.4 Option 2

Option 2 considers two approaches combined: A business as usual scoring structure (SG60 - SG100), but with increased levels of external validation (Option 2a), and Option 2a applied with a risk based

approach to evidence requirements (Option 2b). Both Options 2a and 2b are presented separately below but are combined to form Option 2.

## 2.2.4.1 Option 2a - Business as usual structure but with increased levels of external verification

In this option, the external verification requirements would increase aligned with outcomes of the Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) work package being delivered as part of the P3 project Ensuring effective fisheries management systems are in place.

## Example Draft Requirements:

The following draft scoring table illustrates a potential raising of the bar for evidence requirements which would increase at each Scoring Guidepost. The percentage coverage is purely illustrative at this point, however demonstrates a proposed intent to shift the existing SG80 requirements of 20% coverage, to the SG60 level constituting minimum entry criteria.

## 2.2.4.2 Option 2b - Business as usual structure with increased levels of external verification and a risk based approach

In this option, increased levels of external verification would be required at each scoring guidepost as per Option 2a, however, a risk based approach to determining the level of evidence required at each SG would be applied. This would enable the triage of fisheries according to their relative risk of engaging in shark finning.

## Example draft requirements (for illustrative purposes only):

Figure 2: Example risk-based approach to evidence requirements for shark finning scoring. Decision tree highlights which category of risk the fishery falls into and from there the CAB can determine which evidence requirements are needed to achieve which score.

<!-- image -->

The risk based approach to evidence requirements would operate in combination with the following scoring table and draft requirements.

Table 15: Example scoring table for Option 2b (Topic 2). Levels of external validation could be scaled by the relative risk of the fishery engaging in shark finning. Note that the language of these draft scoring requirements is intended to be illustrative only. It has been drafted to help visualise the proposed changes, and will undergo considerable refinement in later stages.

## 2.2.5 Option 3 - Address shark finning as a compliance issue in P3

As part of the P3 project, a consultant was commissioned to determine proposed pathways for including P2 compliance issues within P3. Table 17 illustrates the proposal from that consultancy report. This would alter scoring within the Standard if it was adopted.

Further draft proposals were generated by the project leads (Table 18), which promote the need for higher resolution of information requirements under P3 for shark finning in order to match the existing Standard in P1 and P2 scoring for shark finning without losing resolution.

## 2.2.6 Comparison of Options under Topic 2

The public consultation informed the majority of Topic 2. Both a single scoring guidepost (SG60) with the same high bar applied for all fisheries, or the inclusion of a risk-based approach to a single scoring guidepost (SG60) were likely the most acceptable and effective options in terms of reinforcing the MSC Board intent as well as positioning the requirements in line with stakeholder concerns. An increasing level of external verification across the three SGs, although somewhat feasible for fishery partners, would not represent the most rigorous outcome from an acceptability point of view. Placing shark finning within a compliance framework in P3 was also not preferred, given it would likely not allow the level of detail for scoring that is afforded when shark finning is considered at present under P1 and P2.

## 2.3 Topic 3 - Revise requirements to reflect advances in best practice for prevention of shark finning

## 2.3.1 Background

This aspect of the project has been informed by a preliminary survey sent by the MSC to various management agencies, a recent consultancy commissioned by the MSC and a public consultation as part of the FSR.

Both the preliminary survey and the consultancy indicated that around half of global management agencies currently include an FNA policy. The consultancy incorporated results from MSC's initial survey, and investigated the top 40 shark fishing nations (with the addition of China, Myanmar and Vietnam) and numerous RFMOs. Consequently the results from the consultancy have been used predominantly to inform this part of the project.

Of the 43 shark fishing nations investigated, 19 agencies have adopted a FNA approach (≈45%). However, only 21 nations had banned the practice of finning, thus, a FNA policy is often implemented to deal with a shark finning ban (≈90%). These results indicate that if FNA is compared across all jurisdictions, it is likely global best practice and appropriate for SG80. However, when considered for countries that have banned shark finning FNA represents a much higher uptake, suggesting it is an appropriate minimum entry level requirement at SG60.

ENGOs are adamant that FNA should be a stand-alone requirement at SG60 in order to demonstrate MSC's commitment to a zero tolerance policy on shark finning. This notion is supported from the consultation feedback as the majority of participants felt that the MSC requirements did not meet global best practice (≈90%) and that FNA was feasible and possible within global fisheries (≈80%).

When asked, 'Other than Fins Naturally Attached, are there other policies that could deliver a similar level of confidence that shark finning is not occurring?' around 60% of participants felt there was no other suitable policy. This position is somewhat confounded by the fact that the consultancy report identified that when an FNA policy was enacted, often there were exemptions that were species specific or processing related.

Further, the uptake in adoption of FNA by management jurisdictions since the publication of v1.3 and v2.0 was also investigated in the consultancy. Seven of the 19 agencies have implemented an FNA policy since the publication of v2.0 requirements in 2014. Given that the existing requirements include FNA but also allow for processing at SG80, this suggests that the existing requirements are not reflective of the shift in FNA adoption.

The following options have been identified to address these issues:

- 0.) Business as usual
- 1.) Include FNA as an additional scoring option at SG60, and increased levels of external validation mandated. Cutting of fins and processing (currently permissible at SG60) would still be permissible but with higher levels of external validation required relative to if an FNA policy is in place. Neither processing nor cutting of fins would be permissible at the SG100 level.
- 2.) Apply FNA as the only option for scoring at SG60 - SG100. Levels of external validation required would increase from SG60 - SG100.
- 3.) Apply single SG at 60 level (using Option 1 from Topic 2) mandating that an FNA policy must be in place unless formal exemptions apply to the UoA through the relevant management agency.

These options and associated impacts are presented sequentially below. The main areas for impact assessment are effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and accessibility and retention.

2.3.3 Option 1: Business as usual with FNA as additional scoring option at SG60 with increased levels of external validation required (specifically high levels for processing or cutting of fins). Processing would no longer be a scoring option at SG100.

## Draft Example Scoring Table:

The following table outlines draft requirements to illustrate the option proposed.

Table 21: Example draft scoring table for Option 1 (Topic 3). Note that the language of these draft scoring requirements is intended to be illustrative only. It has been drafted to help visualise the proposed changes, and will undergo considerable refinement in later stages.

The scoring table above would work in combination with the following draft requirements:

SA2.4.5.X When scoring at SG60, the expectation is that one of the following sub-paragraphs applies: If fins are cut on board:

- a) There are regulations in place governing the management of sharks;
- b) Shark fins and carcasses shall be landed together in compliance with a ratio specifically relevant for the species, fishing fleet and initial post-catch processing (e.g. fresh / frozen / dried) and
- i. The team shall document the justification for using the specific ratio.
- c) Comprehensive external validation of the vessel's activities is available to confirm that it is likely that shark finning is not taking place.

## If sharks are processed on board:

- a) There are regulations in place governing the management of sharks;
- b) There is full documentation of the destination of all shark bodies and body parts; and
- c) 'Good' external validation of the vessel's activities is available to confirm that it is likely that shark finning is not taking place.

## All sharks are landed with fins naturally attached

- a) Some external validation of the vessel's activities is available to confirm that it is likely that shark finning is not taking place.

SA2.4.5.X When scoring at SG80, the expectation is that one of the following sub-paragraphs applies:

## All sharks are landed with fins naturally attached

- a) Good external validation of the vessel's activities is available to confirm that it is high likely that shark finning is not taking place.

## If sharks are processed on board:

- a) There are regulations in place governing the management of sharks;
- b) There is full documentation of the destination of all shark bodies and body parts; and
- c) 'Comprehensive' external validation of the vessel's activities is available to confirm that it is highly likely that shark finning is not taking place.

SA2.4.5.X When scoring at SG100, the expectation is that:

## All sharks are landed with fins naturally attached

- a) Comprehensive external validation of the vessel's activities is available to confirm with a high degree of certainty that shark finning is not taking place.

The risks and benefits of adopting this option are considered in the following table.

## 2.3.4 Option 2: FNA is the only scoring option permissible with increased external validation applied at all SGs (ie. No on board processing or cutting of fins would be allowed)

In this option, the SG60, SG80 and SG100 scoring guideposts would remain as the current requirements, being 'It is likely, highly likely, or high degree of certainty that shark finning is not taking place' respectively.

The requirements would be redrafted similar to the example below:

Table 23: Example draft scoring table for Option 2 (Topic 3). Note that the language of these draft scoring requirements is intended to be illustrative only. It has been drafted to help visualise the proposed changes, and will undergo considerable refinement in later stages.

The expected risks and benefits of this option are outlined in the table below.

## 2.3.5 Option 3

Option 3 comprises two separate components combined: A single SG with FNA mandated for all fisheries unless the fishery has undergone a formal exemption through the relevant management

agency (Option 3a.) and Option 3a but with a risk based approach to evidence requirements (Option 3b.) These two components are considered separately below but collectively comprise Option 3.

## 2.3.5.1 Option 3a: FNA standalone requirement at SG60 unless fishery has undergone exemption process with relevant management agency (e.g. New Zealand / WCPFC)

With respect to FNA policy adoption, the consultancy report demonstrated that certain jurisdictions have enacted an FNA policy but with exemptions. These can be species specific (e.g. New Zealand have differing policies for QMS species) or to do with storage (e.g. WCPFC allowing fins artificially bound to the carcass via rope or wire). These situations demonstrate that the agency has both implemented FNA but allowed for practical or well-founded reasons why exceptions exist.

This option for the MSC would essentially require default FNA for all fisheries unless they can demonstrate their management agency has an alternative approach that still ensures shark finning does not take place.

This option could work in combination with Option 1 from Topic 2. An example of the draft scoring table is provided below, which moves the current SG100 wording to SG60:

Table 25: Example draft scoring table for Option 3a. (Topic 3). Note that the language of these draft scoring requirements is intended to be illustrative only. It has been drafted to help visualise the proposed changes, and will undergo considerable refinement in later stages.

| Component          | PI    | SI   | SG60                                                     | SG80       | SG100      |

| Harvest  strategy  | 1.2.1 | (e)  | There is a high  degree of certainty  that shark finning | Not scored | Not scored |
| Primary  Species   | 2.1.2 | (d)  | is not taking place.                                     | Not scored | Not scored |
| Secondary  species | 2.2.2 | (d)  | There is a high  degree of certainty  that shark finning | Not scored | Not scored |
| ETP species        | 2.3.2 | (f)  | There is a high  degree of certainty  that shark finning | Not scored | Not scored |

## Example draft requirements for illustrative purposes only:

When scoring this SI, the expectation shall be that one of the following sub-paragraphs applies:

- o A fins naturally attached (FNA) policy is in place for the UoA
-  Good external validation is in place
- o The UoA can demonstrate that the following conditions apply:
-  The relevant management agency has an active shark finning ban in place
-  FNA has been adopted by the relevant management agency for at least a portion of fisheries under that jurisdiction
-  Specific exemptions to the FNA policy apply to the UoA with respect to shark finning that can be verified through documented evidence
-  Comprehensive external validation is in place to provide confidence that shark finning is not occurring, equivalent to that of an FNA policy in place.

## Draft guidance:

- -Species specific exemptions to FNA exist for some well managed fisheries that interact with sharks. Assessment teams should only accept exemptions if there is clear documentation in legislation that certain species are exempt. The same exemptions can be applied to cutting or

processing of fins onboard, e.g. needing the fins and carcass in the same bag or allowing fins artificially bound to the carcass via rope or wire). However, any exemptions must not undermine the overall assurance that shark finning is not taking place.

This option could be considered in two different ways which will both be taken forward for further impact testing. In the first scenario, exemptions could apply only when the remainder of the fleet is already covered by an FNA policy and it can be demonstrated that the management agency in question has an active finning ban in place. In this scenario exemptions are enabled with adequate restrictions to ensure that confidence can be provided that shark finning is not occurring. This would mean that jurisdictions such as IATTC that allow Fin to Carcass Ratio approaches for all fisheries operating under their jurisdiction, would not meet the requirements for an 'exemption' as per our requirements.

The second way of considering this issue could be to enable exemptions provided a finning ban is in place and appropriate verification can be provided to give confidence that shark finning is not occurring equivalent to implementing an FNA policy. In this scenario, the difference would be that certain jurisdictions that allow a Fin to Carcass Ratio for all fisheries to be applied would be eligible provided they have a higher observer coverage level.

## 2.3.5.2 Option 3b: FNA standalone requirement at SG60 unless fishery has undergone exemption process with relevant management agency (e.g. New Zealand / WCPFC), with addition of risk based approach to evidence requirements

Option 3b is essentially Option 3a but applied in combination with a risk based approach to evidence requirements as outlined below:

The following draft requirements and risk based approach are outlined for illustrative purposes only and do not constitute formal proposals at this time.

Figure 3: Example risk decision tree for defining evidence requirements for the UoA under assessment.

<!-- image -->

The risk based decision tree above would be used in combination with the following scoring table and associated requirements.

Table 26: Example scoring table for Option 3b (Topic 3). Note that the language of these draft scoring requirements is intended to be illustrative only. It has been drafted to help visualise the proposed changes, and will undergo considerable refinement in later stages.

| Component          | PI    | SI   | SG60                               | SG80       | SG100      |

| Secondary  species | 2.2.2 | (d)  | not taking place.                  |            |            |
| ETP species        | 2.3.2 | (f)  | Low risk: 5%  external  validation |            |            |
|                    |       |      | Medium risk: 20%  external         |            |            |

## Example draft requirements:

Risk criteria as defined in SAXXX shall be used to define the evidence requirements to score this SI.

When scoring this SI, the expectation shall be that one of the following sub-paragraphs applies:

- · A fins naturally attached (FNA) policy is in place for the UoA
- · The UoA can demonstrate that the following conditions apply:
- o The relevant management agency has an active shark finning ban in place
- o FNA has been adopted by the relevant management agency for at least a portion of fisheries under that jurisdiction
- o Specific exemptions to the FNA policy apply to the UoA with respect to shark finning that can be verified through documented evidence
- o Comprehensive external validation is in place to provide confidence that shark finning is not occurring, equivalent to that of an FNA policy in place.

When applying the risk based approach to evidence requirements, further determination of what constitutes high risk would be required in impact assessment and options development in 2021. This could include ensuring that any fishery subject to an exemption is automatically designated as requiring 'high risk' level information as per the evidence adequacy project.

Consideration of the risks and benefits of adopting Option 3b are described in the table below.

## 2.3.6 Comparison of Options under Topic 3

The consultant report results were used to determine feasibility and accessibility of the respective proposals across the range of management jurisdictions. Of the 40 jurisdictions, 10 jurisdictions cannot be reported as relevant documents could not be located. A review of the 30 jurisdictions indicates that Options 0 and 1 are the most accessible and feasible options, though they are likely to be unacceptable to eNGOs. With regards to Option 2, 19 (63%) of the 30 jurisdictions do not have full FNA policies in place which could pose retention and accessibility issues for the program. This option would not account for management regimes in countries such as New Zealand, USA, Taiwan P.China, Japan, and South Africa which have adopted FNA for a portion of fisheries under their management but have exemptions in place for specific circumstances. Option 3 could provide more flexibility, potentially enabling access for those aforementioned jurisdictions. Results are detailed in Table 28.

| Jurisdiction      | Option 0  BaU   | Option 1 (BaU  with FNA option  at SG60 and  increased  external  validation)   | Option 2 (FNA  only at SG60, 80  and 100 with  increasing levels  of external  validation)   | Option 3 (FNA  must be in place  unless UoA is  legally exempt by  mgmt.)   |

With regards to RFMOs, the options were also reviewed for feasibility and accessibility (Table 29). Of the eight RFMOs sampled, only three of them would meet a full FNA requirement (Option 2). Option 3 could be accessible and feasible for five RFMOs. IOTC and WCPFC have adopted FNA broadly but enable exemptions under specific circumstances. Fisheries operating under these management agencies with agreed exemptions could be eligible for certification under Option 3 but not Option 2.

Overall, given the tradeoffs between accessibility, acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness, Option 3 provides a robust and precautionary assessment process to ensure shark finning is not occurring. It recognises the increased adoption of FNA across management jurisdictions but also recognises that alternative approaches to FNA do exist and can provide confidence under the right conditions, that

shark finning is not occurring equivalent to an FNA approach. Whilst this likely does not go quite far enough for some eNGOs, it signals progress and strikes a balance that should be broadly acceptable to our wide range of polarised stakeholders.

## 3 Discussion and conclusion

Three topics have been considered separately in this impact assessment, with multiple options considered under each Topic. Moving forwards, as options are narrowed down, options will be taken forward for further impact assessment and public consultation in 2021. As this project progresses, the linkages and crossover between these topics will merge such that Topic 2 and Topic 3 will be considered together. Outcomes of other FSR projects such as the P3 evidence requirements work package and the ETP project will also be considered and integrated in further developments to these draft requirements in 2021.

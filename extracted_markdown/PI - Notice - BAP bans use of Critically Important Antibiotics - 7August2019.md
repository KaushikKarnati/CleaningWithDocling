## BAP Program Update

## Stricter Stance on Antibiotics Use in Farms, Effective January 1, 2021

7 August 2019

Dear BAP Certified Producer,

Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) would like to advise certified facilities of an upcoming change to its requirements on antibiotic usage. As of January 1, 2021, the use of antimicrobials designated as Critically Important for Human Medicine by the World Health Organization (WHO) will be prohibited for farms certified under the BAP Salmon Farm Standard or the Finfish and Crustacean Farm Standard.

Please refer to the WHO publication, 'Critically important antimicrobials for human medicine, 6th revision' for a complete list of Critically Important antimicrobials (Annex 1, page 27-34). The publication is available for download here: https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/antimicrobials-sixth/en/

The Global Aquaculture Alliance's (GAA) multi-stakeholder Standards Oversight Committee (SOC) made the decision to strengthen its stance on antimicrobials in response to growing public concern about antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. According to WHO, the use of antimicrobials in food animals can be a source of antimicrobial resistant bacteria that can spread to humans through the environment and the food supply.

The global aquaculture industry is already reducing use of antimicrobials through various measures including vaccinations and probiotics. The decision to prohibit the use of WHO critical antimicrobials in the BAP standards will provide a renewed focus on combatting antimicrobial resistance in aquaculture. Additionally, only approved antibiotics are allowed for medicinal use by the BAP standards under oversight by a veterinarian or fish health professional. Use of antibiotics to promote growth is prohibited.

The BAP standards are continually updated under the guidance of the 12-member SOC, which comprises members with broad stakeholder representation - one-third conservation, one-third academia and one-third industry. The SOC has been in existence for 10 years, celebrating 10 th anniversary this year. Please contact the Program Integrity team at programintegrity@bapcertification.org with any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

Chris Weeks BAP Program Integrity Manager 603-317-5000 Ext. 160

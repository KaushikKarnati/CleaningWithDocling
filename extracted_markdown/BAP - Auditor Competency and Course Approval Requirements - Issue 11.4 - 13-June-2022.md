## 1.0 Overview

The  BAP  Auditor  and  Industry  Observer  Training  Course  is  an  intensive,  classroom-based  seminar, conducted several times a year in a variety of locations around the world. The course teaches the various BAP standards and offers a detailed analysis of the clauses contained within.  Each standard, and the various sub-sections, are taught by a trained BAP staff member, or by BAP senior auditors with practical field knowledge and expertise in their respective modules.

In  addition  to  both  new  candidates  and  returning  auditors,  BAP  also  encourages  interested  industry observers to join the course for a first-hand, in-depth look into the BAP standards. Space is available on a first-come first-served basis.

ONLY seafood related information relevant to the category(ies) being applied for.

Experience not related to seafood (such as audits of dairy plants or agricultural farms) must be removed. Inclusion of large amounts of non-BAP category related areas will cause the submittal to be rejected and returned for correction.

Applicant information submitted to BAP where the competency requirements have not been clearly met, where all required documents listed herein were not sent, or where the certification body did not properly screen their candidates will be rejected and returned to the applicant or certification body for correction.

## 9.0 Submittal to BAP

BAP will review the above information from all candidates and make the final decision as to approval for attendance.

## Currently Approved and Active BAP Auditors Wishing to Extend their Scope

Returning auditors currently approved and active for some standards wishing to be considered for approval for additional standards need to:

- · Ensure the competency requirements for the new category have been met;
- · Update  credentials  (CV,  audit  log,  any  training  certificates  obtained)  to  clearly show the competency requirements for the category have been met;
- · Submit above credentials to the certification body you work for screening and approval. The certification body is not to send the information on to BAP until it has been properly screened;
- · Or, if an independent auditor not working as an employee of a particular certification body, update credentials and submit directly to BAP.

## BAP Auditors who are not Current

Anyone  who  attended  a  BAP  course  prior  to  2010,  who  has  not  maintained  active  status conducting BAP audits, and/or has not been to a course in 3 years or more, will need to submit full updated credentials to requalify.

## New Independent Auditors

Independent  auditors  not  currently  working  for  or  subcontracted  by  a  BAP  approved Certification Body - Independent candidates wishing to apply to attend the BAP course as an independent auditor candidate have two options:

- · Contact a BAP-approved certification body in advance to find out if any of them might be interested in hiring you if you pass the course. If so, make arrangements with that certification body to send them all required credentials and have them screen your candidacy. Once the candidate has been confirmed by the certification body to meet the requirements the certification body is to send the candidates name and credentials to BAP for final approval and invoicing.
- · Submit your credentials as described in this document directly to BAP for screening. State the exact BAP categories you are seeking approval for, and ensure you meet the requirements. Once screened and approved by BAP, pay the invoice for the course. If you pass the course, you may seek to be hired by one or more of the BAP approved certification bodies  after-the-fact.

All fees must be paid before the first day of your scheduled class or you will not be allowed access to the classroom component or access to pre-work online.

## 10.0  Pre-Work, Tests and Case Studies

All approved auditors will have pre-work, case studies and final exams as part of the course. Pre-work and exams  will  be  graded  and  those  scores  will  be  used  to  determine  if  a  candidate  passes  the  course. Observers will not be given pre-work or tests. You will receive an email from BAP on how to complete your pre-work online, prior to the beginning of class and it must be completed and submitted electronically before the first day of the class. Failure to complete any required tests or pre-work will result in an automatic failure for that competency.

## 11.0  Course Completion and Next Steps

All auditors must attend their required classroom days and complete and pass all pre-work, case studies and tests for each of the competencies they are applying/extending for. Candidates that meet both the competency requirements and pass the pre-work and tests for the area of competency applied for will be approved as BAP Auditors but cannot audit alone until they have gone through training/shadow/witness auditing to the satisfaction of one or more of the BAP-approved certification bodies.

Please, do not hesitate to contact BAP with any questions or concerns!

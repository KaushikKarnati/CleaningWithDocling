## The Marine Stewardship Council

## Vision

Our vision is of the world's oceans teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations.

## Mission

Our mission is to use our ecolabel and fishery certification program to contribute to the health of the world's oceans by recognising and rewarding sustainable fishing practices, influencing the choices people make when buying seafood, and working with our partners to transform the seafood market to a sustainable basis.

## General introduction

## Fisheries certification

With international consultation with stakeholders, the MSC has developed standards for sustainable fishing and seafood traceability. These standards ensure that MSC labelled seafood comes from, and can be traced back to, a sustainable fishery.

MSC standards and requirements meet global best practice guidelines for certification and labelling programs.

The MSC Fisheries Standard sets out requirements that a fishery must meet to enable it to claim that its fish come from a well-managed and sustainable source.

Throughout the world, fisheries are using good management practices to safeguard jobs, secure fish stocks for the future and help protect the marine environment. The science-based MSC environmental standard for sustainable fishing offers fisheries a way to confirm sustainability, using a credible, independent third-party assessment process. Certification means sustainable fisheries can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace and gives an assurance to consumers that their seafood comes from a well-managed and sustainable source.

The MSC Fisheries Standard applies to wild-capture fisheries that meet the scope requirements provided in Section 7.4.

The MSC Fisheries Standard comprises of the following core Principles:

## Principle 1: Sustainable target fish stocks

A fishery must be conducted in a manner that does not lead to over-fishing or depletion of the exploited populations and, for those populations that are depleted, the fishery must be conducted in a manner that demonstrably leads to their recovery.

## Principle 2: Environmental impact of fishing

Fishing operations should allow for the maintenance of the structure, productivity, function and diversity of the ecosystem on which the fishery depends. The ecosystem includes habitat and associated dependent and ecologically related species.

## Principle 3: Effective management

The fishery is subject to an effective management system that respects local, national and international laws and standards and incorporates institutional and operational frameworks that require use of the resource to be responsible and sustainable.

## Implementation timeframes ◙

## Effective date of the Fisheries Certification Process v2.3

Publication date: 26 October 2022

Effective date: 01 May 2023

CABs shall conduct any assessment process (initial assessment, surveillance audit, scope extension, expedited audit, or reassessment) against the MSC Fisheries Standard v2.01 (and subsequent versions up to v2.99) that is announced on or after 1 May 2023 in conformity with the MSC Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) v2.3.

Any CAB may use the FCP v2.3 as of the publication date if they are ready to do so and templates and training are ready.

## Review

The MSC welcomes comments on the FCP. Comments will be considered as part of the next review process. Reviews will take place at least every 5 years. Please submit comments to standards@msc.org.

More information about the MSC policy development process and MSC Standard Setting Procedure can be found on the MSC website (msc.org).

## Introduction to this document

The MSC Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) v2.3 and the annexes define the process requirements for CABs to assess fisheries against the MSC Fisheries Standard.

The FCP consists of the assessment process (Sections 1-7) and process annexes (PA-PF).

## Fisheries Certification Process

The purposes of the FCP are:

- · To establish a defined process that enables all CABs to operate in a consistent and controlled manner.
- · To provide transparency to maintain credibility with stakeholders.

## The MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process

Guidance is provided in the MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process (GFCP) to help CABs interpret the FCP. The GFCP is maintained as a separate document.

The headings and numbering in the GFCP, when included, match those in the FCP exactly, with numbers prefaced with the letter 'G' to indicate guidance.

The MSC recommends that CABs read the FCP in conjunction with the GFCP. Text in the FCP is not repeated in the GFCP.

Where guidance is provided that generally relates to the subject of a section, or relates to the content of a specific clause, this icon ◙ appears at the end of the section title or clause in the FCP. These icons provide hyperlinks to the related guidance section in the GFCP.

In the GFCP, this icon ▲ provides a hyperlink back to the corresponding section or clause in the FCP.

## The MSC Interpretations Log

The MSC occasionally provides additional guidance to CABs and assessment teams via interpretations that are posted on a public Interpretations Log. Interpretations are provided in response to questions about requirements in the FCP, the Fisheries Standard and the General Certification Requirements (GCR). Interpretations help clarify the MSC's intent and provide additional information and guidance to explain how a requirement should be interpreted and applied. They are not new requirements.

The MSC recommends that CABs and assessment teams check the Interpretations Log on a regular basis and follow relevant interpretations.

## Auditability of the Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process and interpretations

The guidance in the GFCP and interpretations is not directly auditable.

## Derogations

Derogations are temporary normative measures that allow for an MSC requirement to be applied differently or disregarded. Derogations are provided in response to editorial errors, force majeure, where intent is no longer fit for purpose and threatens MSC credibility or as a provision to test a policy change or modify the implementation timeframe when publishing a revised version of the normative document. Derogations are posted on a public log. The MSC requires CABs to follow relevant derogations.

- c. Birds.
- d. Mammals.
- 7.4.8.2 The UoA shall not use poisons or explosives.

## Controversial unilateral exemption to an international agreement

- 7.4.8.3 The UoA shall not be conducted under a controversial unilateral exemption to an international agreement.
- a. The CAB shall use these definitions to interpret this criterion:
- i. 'Controversial' means creating a controversy in the wider international community rather than simply between 2 states.
- ii. 'Unilateral' means arising from the action of a single state.
- iii. 'Exemption' means a refusal to join or abide by the rules of an international management body, or the taking of a reservation or exception to a measure adopted by such body, when in either such case the effect is to undermine the sustainable management of the UoA.
- iv. 'International agreements' are those with a direct mandate for sustainable management of the resources affected by the UoA according to the outcomes expressed by Principles 1 and 2.
- b. When verifying UoA conformity with this criterion, the CAB shall take into consideration:
- i. The relationship between international and coastal state jurisdictions recognised by relevant international agreements.
- ii. Whether exemptions result in the implementation of a higher or lower level of conservation than are currently agreed by an international management body.
- iii. Whether the sustainable management of the UoA is undermined.

## Conviction for forced or child labour

- 7.4.8.4 The CAB shall determine the eligibility of fishery applicants and certificate holders with respect to the MSC's labour policy using the relevant sections within the MSC Labour Eligibility Requirements.

## Conviction for shark finning

- 7.4.8.5 The CAB shall confirm that the client or client group does not include an entity that has been convicted for a shark finning violation in the last 2 years. ◙

- b. If a conviction is determined, the CAB shall consider the entity as out of scope until 2 years have passed since the date of the conviction.

## Controversy - disputes in fisheries

- 7.4.8.6 The UoA shall not be eligible for certification if there is no mechanism for resolving disputes, or if the disputes overwhelm the UoA. ◙

- a. If the UoA applying for certification is the subject of controversy and/or dispute at any time during the assessment process or certification cycle, the CAB shall consider:
- i. Whether the fisheries management regime (national or international system or plan) includes a mechanism for resolving disputes.
- ii. If there is a mechanism for resolving disputes, whether that mechanism is adequate to deal with potential or existing disputes (e.g. do stakeholders have access to the mechanism for resolving disputes and is there sufficient scope to cover the relevant issues).
- iii. Whether disputes overwhelm the UoA enough to prevent it from meeting the MSC Fisheries Standard.

## Enhanced fisheries

- 7.4.8.7 Using the criteria in Table 1, the CAB shall determine whether the UoA is an eligible enhanced fishery. ◙
- a. If a fishery is enhanced, the UoA shall only be eligible for assessment if it conforms to all of the scope criteria.

Table 1: Scope criteria for eligible enhanced fisheries

| A   | Linkages to and maintenance of a wild stock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| i   | At some point in the production process, the system relies upon the capture of fish from the  wild environment . Such fish may be taken at any stage of the life cycle including eggs,  larvae, juveniles or adults. The 'wild environment' in this context includes marine,  freshwater and any other aquatic ecosystems. |
| ii  | The  species are native  to the geographic region of the UoA and the natural production  areas from which the UoA's catch originates.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| iii | There are  natural reproductive components  of the stock from which the UoA's catch  originates that maintain themselves without having to be restocked every year.                                                                                                                                                        |
| iv  | Where fish stocking is used in hatch-and-catch (HAC) systems, such stocking does not  form a major part of a current rebuilding plan for depleted stocks.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     | Note: This requirement shall apply to the current status of the UoA. Wild stocks shall be  managed by other conventional means. If rebuilding has been done by stocking in the past,  it shall not result in an out-of-scope determination as long as other measures are now in  place.                                    |

## B Feeding and husbandry

- i The production system operates without substantial augmentation of food supply . In HAC systems, any feeding is used only to grow the animals to a small size prior to release (not more than 10% of the average adult maximum weight), such that most of the total growth (not less than 90%) is achieved during the wild phase. In catch-and-grow (CAG) systems, feeding during the captive phase is only by natural means (e.g. filter feeding in mussels), or at a level and duration that provide only for the maintenance of condition (e.g. crustaceans in holding tanks) rather than to achieve growth.
- ii In CAG systems, production during the captive phase does not routinely require disease prevention involving chemicals or compounds with medicinal prophylactic properties.

## C Habitat and ecosystem impacts

## A Linkages to and maintenance of a wild stock

- i Any modifications to the habitat of the stock are reversible and do not cause serious or irreversible harm to the natural ecosystem's structure and function.

Note: Habitat modifications that are not reversible, are already in place and are not created specifically for the UoA shall be in scope. This includes:

- · Large-scale artificial reefs.
- · Structures associated with enhancement activities that do not cause irreversible harm to the natural ecosystem inhabited by the stock, such as salmon fry farms next to river systems.

## Introduced Species Based Fisheries (ISBF)

- 7.4.8.8 The CAB shall only accept an application for certification from a UoA targeting an introduced species if it meets the scope criteria contained in Table 2.
- a. If the UoA is based upon an introduced species, the CAB shall follow the necessary steps in the MSC Fisheries Standard Annex SD.
- b. The CAB shall inform clients that the requirements for ISBF are part of a pilot program and may be subject to change.

Table 2: Scope criteria for ISBF

| A   | Irreversibility of the introduction in the new location                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| i   | The introduced species has a large population size (comparable to or larger than the  population sizes of other native species occupying similar ecological niches in the new  location).                                                                                       |
| ii  | The species has spread to a range beyond that of its initial introduction in the new location.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| iii | There is evidence to demonstrate that the species cannot be eradicated from the location by  known mechanisms without serious ecological, economic and/or social consequences.                                                                                                  |
| B   | History of the introduction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| i   | The species was introduced to the new location prior to 1993; this being the year that the  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which includes provisions on introduced species,  was ratified.                                                                           |
| ii  | If the introduction occurred after the CBD was ratified, such fisheries shall only potentially be  in scope if the introduction was non-deliberate and occurred at least 20 years prior to the date  the application is made for assessment against the MSC Fisheries Standard. |
| C   | No further introductions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| i   | There is no continuing introduction of the introduced species being considered for certification  to the location (i.e. the species is now entirely self-sustaining in its new location).                                                                                       |

## 7.5 Scope of assessment: defining the Unit of Assessment and Unit of Certification ◙

- 7.5.1 The CAB shall use all available information in the 'MSC Client Document Checklist' and pre-assessment reports about the fishery to determine the UoA and the UoC.

- 7.5.2 The CAB shall determine the proposed UoA (i.e. what is to be assessed) to include: ◙
- a. The target stock(s).
- b. The fishing gear type(s) and, if relevant, vessel type(s). ◙
- c. The fishing fleets or groups of vessels, or individual fishing operators pursuing that stock, including any other eligible fishers that are outside the proposed UoC.

- a. The target stock(s).
- b. The fishing gear type(s) and, if relevant, vessel type(s). ◙
- c. The fishing fleets or groups of vessels or individual fishing operators pursuing that stock including entities initially intended to be covered by the certificate.
- 7.5.4 The CAB shall not define the UoA and UoC by a subset of activities undertaken with the stock(s) and gear(s) combination. ◙
- 7.5.5 The CAB shall not define the UoA and UoC based on the species caught as determined at the time of fishing, where the objective is simply to exclude certain hauls from the assessment. ◙
- 7.5.6 The CAB shall define the geographical area in which the UoA and UoC operate. ◙

## Changes to UoAs/UoCs and withdrawal of UoAs and proposed UoCs during the assessment

- 7.5.7 The CAB shall not change a UoA and proposed UoC during the assessment unless the UoA is announced provisionally in the initial announcement and confirmed later in conformity with 7.15.3. ◙
- 7.5.8 If the fishery client decides to withdraw a UoA and proposed UoC during the assessment, the CAB shall: ◙
- a. Publish an announcement informing stakeholders that the UoA and proposed UoC have been withdrawn from assessment.
- b. Update the MSC database to remove the UoA and proposed UoC from assessment.
- c. Include the changes in the next assessment report.

## Traceability factors

- 7.5.9 The CAB shall conduct an initial review of key traceability factors and document whether any of the following risks are applicable: ◙
- a. The possibility of non-certified gears being used within the UoC.
- b. The possibility of vessels from the UoC fishing outside the UoC or in different geographical areas (on the same trips or different trips).
- c. The possibility of vessels from outside the UoC or client group fishing the same stock.
- d. Any other risks of substitution between fish from the UoC and fish from outside the UoC.
- 7.5.9.1 The CAB shall inform the client of its obligations to meet traceability requirements before it sells fish or fish products from the UoC as MSC certified or under assessment, including that: ◙

- a. Systems are in place to ensure that fish and fish products from the UoC are traceable back to the UoC.
- b. Systems are in place to ensure that fish and fish products from the UoC are segregated from fish or fish products not included in the UoC.

## Other eligible fishers and entities and certificate sharing

- 7.5.10 The CAB shall determine whether there are other eligible fishers or other entities that may share the certificate as client group members. ◙

7.5.10.1

Fishers or other entities that are not identified as part of the UoA or as part of the client group membership shall not be eligible to gain access to the certification later, unless they conform to the requirements of Section 7.27.

- 7.5.10.2 If there are other eligible fishers or other entities that may share the certificate as client group members within the UoA, the CAB shall require the client to:
- a. In the 'MSC Fishery Announcement Template', prepare a statement for the CAB to upload to the MSC database for publication on the MSC website of the client's understanding and willingness for reasonable certificate sharing arrangements.
- b. Inform other eligible fishers and/or other entities of the public statement and of the opportunity to share the certificate, during relevant interactions with the eligible fishers and other entities as is practicable.

## Inseparable or practicably inseparable catches

7.5.11 The CAB shall determine whether there are catches of non-target (Principle 2) stock(s) that are inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) from target (Principle 1) stock(s). ◙

- 7.5.11.1 The CAB shall only recognise stock(s) as being an IPI stock where the inseparability arises because either:
- a. The non-target catch is practicably indistinguishable during normal fishing operations (i.e. the catch is from a stock of the same species or a closely related species), or
- b. When distinguishable, it is not commercially feasible to separate due to the practical operation of the UoA that would require significant modification to existing harvesting and processing methods.

And:

- c. The total combined proportion of catches from the IPI stock(s) does not exceed 15% by weight of the total combined catches of target and IPI stock(s) for the UoA.
- d. The IPI stock(s) are not endangered, threatened or protected (ETP) species.
- e. The IPI stock(s) are not certified separately.
- 7.5.12 If the CAB identifies IPI stock(s) as per 7.5.11.1, the CAB shall:
- a. Apply Annex PA.
- b. Upload an announcement to the MSC database for publication on the MSC website, using the 'MSC IPI Announcement Template', to inform stakeholders and the MSC of the identification of IPI stock(s).
- 7.5.13 In the 'MSC IPI Announcement Template', the CAB shall follow either 7.5.13.1 or 7.5.13.2 below.
- 7.5.13.1 The CAB shall confirm that fish or fish products considered as coming from IPI stock(s) may enter into chains of custody subject to Annex PA.
- a. The CAB shall include a detailed and substantiated justification for how the catches under consideration fulfil the requirements of 7.5.11.1 above.

- 7.5.13.2 The CAB shall confirm that fish or fish products considered as coming from IPI stock(s) may enter chains of custody, with an exemption to the additional assessment requirements for IPI stock(s) given in PA1.4.2.
- a. The CAB shall include a detailed and substantiated justification showing that:
- i. The catches under consideration fulfil the requirements of 7.5.11.1 above.
- ii. The catch proportion of IPI stock(s) calculated in 7.5.11.1.c is less than or equal to 2%, and the total catch of IPI stock(s) by the UoA does not have a significant impact on the IPI stock(s) as a whole.
- iii. The CAB shall assess significant impact on the basis of the status of the IPI stock(s), and the risk that the IPI catch poses to the health of the IPI stock(s).
- 7.5.14 The CAB shall upload the IPI announcement as early as practicable in the assessment process, and no later than the date of issue of the Client and Peer Review Draft Report to the client and to the Peer Review College.

## 7.6 Team selection

- 7.6.1 The CAB shall form an assessment team (hereafter 'team') for a fishery assessment, comprising a team leader and a minimum of 1 additional team member, that meets the qualifications and competency requirements specified in Table PC1, Table PC2 and Table PC3 and in line with the personnel requirements in the GCR.
- 7.6.2 If events outside the CAB's control mean that team membership needs to change during an assessment, the CAB shall announce the new team members to stakeholders.

## 7.7 Preparing for the Announcement Comment Draft Report

## UoA with enhanced stock

- 7.7.1 If the UoA contains an enhanced fishery that is not covered in the MSC Fisheries Standard Annex SB or Annex SC: ◙
- 7.7.1.1 The CAB shall review and, if necessary, modify the default assessment tree, taking into account the Performance Indicators (PIs) required to assess the enhancements to achieve, at a minimum, the same level of sustainability performance as the default assessment tree.
- 7.7.1.2 The CAB shall assess:
- a. Enhancement activities against the impacts on the natural reproductive component of the associated wild stock.
- b. The extent of translocation against: ◙
- i. The effect on the natural genetic characteristics of the stock.
- ii. The environmental impacts of translocation.
- c. Environmental modification activities under the Principle 2 assessment for their impacts on other species and the surrounding environment, including:
- i. Feed augmentation. If feeding or disease prevention are used in hatch and catch (HAC) systems, or where other interventions are used in catch and grow (CAG) systems, the team shall confirm that these activities do not have serious negative impacts on other species and the surrounding environment. ◙
- ii. The use of medicines or other chemical compounds.
- iii. Fertilisation to enhance natural food availability.

- iv. Removal of predators or competitors.
- d. The impacts of habitat modification under the habitats and ecosystems components in Principle 2, including: ◙
- i. Whether serious or irreversible harm may be caused to the natural ecosystem's structure and function, including the natural food chains of predator and/or prey species.
- ii. The types and extent of habitat modifications and the possibility of these causing serious or irreversible harm.
- 7.7.1.3 The CAB shall consult with other CABs developing modified assessment trees for similar fisheries.
- 7.7.1.4 If the CAB's proposed modifications to the default assessment tree for an enhanced fishery are later found by the MSC to produce a determination and/or conditions that do not conform to MSC requirements:
- a. The CAB shall review and, if necessary, revise its assessment and scoring to conform to the default assessment tree.
- b. The timing of the review and revisions shall be at the discretion of the MSC and may include a requirement for an expedited audit.
- c. The process shall be sufficient to ensure the continued validity of the determination, in conformity with the FCP.
- 7.7.1.5 If the CAB decides that the default assessment tree requires modification, the CAB shall follow 7.10.5.

## Harmonisation of overlapping UoAs

- 7.7.2 The CAB shall follow PB1.2 to determine whether the UoA overlaps with any existing UoAs (either certified or in assessment).
- 7.7.2.1 If any the UoA overlaps, the CAB shall follow the steps for harmonisation in Annex PB.

## Use of risk-based methods for a data-deficient UoA

- 7.7.3 The CAB shall use the criteria in Table 3 to decide whether a UoA may or may not be data-deficient with respect to 1 or more scoring element(s) within a PI. ◙
- 7.7.3.1 A PI may contain both data-deficient and non-data-deficient scoring elements.
- 7.7.3.2 The CAB shall use the criteria in Table 3 to decide whether a scoring element may or may not be data-deficient.
- 7.7.3.3 The CAB shall apply the criteria in Table 3 to all scoring elements in Principle 1 and Principle 2. ◙
- 7.7.3.4 The CAB shall not use uncertainties in the stock definition or stock assessment models as a justification for using Annex PF in cases where some form of indicators and reference points are available for the UoA. ◙
- 7.7.3.5 If the decision is made that a UoA is data-deficient with respect to 1 or more PIs, the CAB shall use Annex PF for the assessment of those data-deficient PIs.
- 7.7.3.6 If a PI contains both data-deficient and non-data-deficient scoring elements, the CAB shall:
- a. Use Annex PF to assess data-deficient scoring elements.

## PA1 Requirements for inseparable or practicably inseparable stocks

## PA1.1 Scope

PA1.1.1

The requirements of this annex shall apply to all inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) catch within fisheries being assessed.

## PA1.2 Default assessment tree

PA1.2.1 The Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) shall review and, if necessary, propose modifications to the default assessment tree to proceed with the assessment of IPI stock(s).

PA1.2.2 Using the tree, the CAB shall:

- a. Assess the IPI catch under the primary component of Principle 2.
- b. Separately assess the impact of all fishing activity on the IPI stock(s) considered for entry into certified chains of custody using the criteria specified in PA1.4.2, for the purposes of determining the eligibility of the catches of IPI stock(s) to enter further certified Chains of Custody.

## PA1.3 Conditions

PA1.3.1 If there are IPI stock(s) within the scope of certification, the CAB shall set conditions to: ◙

- a. Promote the future Principle 1 assessment of the IPI stock(s), or
- b. Promote the development of techniques to effectively separate catches of currently IPI stock(s).

## PA1.4 Entry into further Chains of Custody

- PA1.4.1 The CAB shall ensure that only defined and limited proportions of catches from IPI stock(s) enter into certified Chains of Custody.

PA1.4.1.1 The MSC ecolabel is only permitted for use on these catches for a maximum of 1 certification period.

- a. The IPI stock(s) are likely to be above biologically based limits as defined in MSC Fisheries Standard Table SA8, or if below the limits, measures are in place that are expected to ensure that all fishing-related mortality does not hinder the recovery and rebuilding of IPI stock(s).
- b. If the stock status is poorly known, measures or practices are in place that are expected to keep the IPI stock(s) above biologically based limits, or to prevent all fishing activity from hindering recovery.
- c. The measures are considered likely to work, based on plausible argument. ◙

## PA1.5 Surveillance

PA1.5.1 If the UoA includes IPI stock(s), the CAB shall review and document the continuing performance against conditions in PA1.3.1 and against the requirements in PA1.4.2.

## PA1.6 Reassessment

PA1.6.1 IPI stock(s) are only eligible for the period of 1 certificate. For continued certification, the CAB shall inform clients of the following options:

- a. Certify all IPI stock(s) against Principle 1 at reassessment.
- b. Develop techniques to effectively separate catches of currently IPI stock(s) from target stock(s) so the IPI scope criteria are no longer met.
- c. Develop measures to reduce the proportion of IPI stock(s), to be able to meet the requirements for IPI stock(s) as set out in 7.5.13.2.

PA1.6.2 The CAB shall assess remaining IPI stock(s) against Principle 1 at reassessment.

precautionary score.

## PF3 Conducting a Consequence Analysis (CA)

## PF3.1 Preparation

PF3.1.1 The team shall conduct a CA for each data-deficient scoring element identified under PI 1.1.1 (target species). ◙

PF3.1.2

The team shall only conduct a CA if some qualitative or quantitative data exist from which trends in 1 or more of the 4 key consequence subcomponents listed in Table PF2 can be identified.

|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Justification for most vulnerable  subcomponent |                   | Reproductive capacity  Age/size/sex structure  Geographic range |                     |
| Justification for consequence score             |                   |                                                                 |                     |

## PF3.3 Determine the CA score

PF3.3.1

The team shall only score the subcomponent (population size, reproductive capacity, age/size/sex structure or geographic range) on which the team decides that the fishing activity is having the most impact.

If there is no agreement between stakeholders, the team shall use the consequence category with the lowest score (60, 80 or 100).

PF3.3.3 The team shall interpret the terms 'insignificant change', 'possible detectable change' and 'detectable change' as follows: ◙

a. 'Insignificant change' shall mean that changes in the subcomponents are undetectable or if detectable, these are of such a low magnitude that the impact of the fishing activity cannot be differentiated from the natural variability for this population.

b. 'Possible detectable change' shall mean that changes are detected and can be reasonably attributable to the fishing activity, but these are of such a low magnitude that the impact of the UoA is considered to be minimal on the population size and dynamics.

c. 'Detectable change' shall mean that changes to the subcomponent can be attributed to the fishing activity and changes are of such magnitude that cannot be considered as minimal.

PF3.3.4 the team shall fail the UoA if fail the fishery if the consequence of the activity is determined to be at higher risk than 60 level in Table PF3.

PF3.3.5

## PF4.4.6 The team shall score areal overlap (availability) as follows: ◙

- a. The team shall generate areal overlap scores after consideration of the overlap of the fishing effort with the distribution of the stock.
- b. If the impacts of fisheries other than the UoA are taken into account, the team shall score the areal overlap as the combined overlap of all listed fisheries with the areal concentration of a stock.
- c. The team shall enter the resulting areal overlap risk scores into those cells in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets' for all listed fisheries.
- d. When scoring the areal overlap the team shall consider the concentration of species and the overlap of the fishing gear with the concentration species. ◙
- e. For species with good distribution maps, the team shall score areal overlap using detailed mapping analysis: the amount of overlap between fishing effort and species stock distribution.
- i. For species without good distribution maps, the team may use stakeholdergenerated maps.

## PF4.4.7 The team shall score encounterability as follows: ◙

- a. The team shall generate encounterability scores after consideration of the likelihood that a species will encounter fishing gear that is deployed within the geographic range of that species.
- b. If the impacts of fisheries other than the UoA are taken into account, the team shall score encounterability as the combined encounterability of all listed fisheries.
- c. The team shall enter the resulting encounterability risk scores into those cells in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets' for all listed fisheries.
- d. When scoring encounterability the team shall consider the concentration of species and the overlap of the fishing gear with the concentration species.
- e. The team shall consider the deployment of fishing gear in relation to the adult habitat of each species as the main aspect for each species.

## PF4.4.8 The team shall score selectivity as follows: ◙

- a. The team shall generate a selectivity score for each gear type within the UoA after consideration of the potential of gear to capture or retain the species that encounters the fishing gear.

- b. If the impacts of fisheries other than the UoA are taken into account, the team shall score selectivity for each gear type of all listed fisheries.
- c. The team shall determine the selectivity risk scores for each combination of gear type and species within the UoA individually and enter them into the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.
- d. The team shall assign scores for gear selectivity using the 2 categories specified in Table PF5. ◙
- i. If elements (a) and (b) indicate different risk scores, the team shall assign a score as the average of the 2 categories, rounded up to the nearest whole number on the 1:3 scale.
- e. The team shall interpret terms 'rarely', 'regularly' and 'frequently' in Table PF5 shall be interpreted as follows:
- i. 'Rarely' means that the capture of individuals smaller than the size at maturity occurs in less than 5% few gear deployments.
- ii. 'Regularly' means that the capture of individuals smaller than the size at maturity occurs in 5% to 50% of the gear deployments.
- iii. 'Frequently' means that the capture of individuals smaller than the size at maturity occurs in more than 50% of gear deployments.
- PF4.4.9 The team shall score Post Capture Mortality (PCM) as follows:
- a. The team shall use its knowledge of species biology and fishing practice together with independent field observations to assess the chance that, if captured, a species would be released and that it would be in a condition to permit subsequent survival. ◙
- b. If the impacts of fisheries other than the UoA are taken into account, the team shall score the post-capture mortality for each gear type of all listed fisheries.
- c. The team shall determine the PCM risk scores for each combination of gear type and species within the UoA individually and enter them into the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.
- d. In the absence of observer data or other verified field observations made during commercial fishing operations that indicate the individuals are released alive and postrelease survivorship is high, the team shall score PCM of all species as default high risk.
- e. The team may reduce the PCM score from a default high risk if:
- i. A high risk score has been allocated for the selectivity, and
- ii. A large portion of animals are returned alive and survive the encounter.
- PF4.4.10 The team may adjust the susceptibility scores if additional information regarding an attribute that justifies a change in score is available and the source of data is appropriate to the fishery(ies) or region(s).

PF4.4.10.1 The team shall document the justification for all changes made.

## PF5.3 Adjusting PI scores

PF5.3.1 If no additional information exists to score the PI, the team shall apply the score directly to the PI with the accompanying 'MSC RBF Worksheets' and provide a justification.

PF5.3.1.1

If additional information justifies modifying the MSC score either upwards or downwards by a maximum of 10 points, the team shall use this information to reach the final MSC score for the PI. ◙

- a. The team shall use all information that is available on the UoA to inform the assessment.
- b. The team shall provide justification for any score modification.

PF5.3.2 The team shall cap the final PI score if only a subset of the total number of species has been evaluated.

PF5.3.2.1

If the team has only considered 'main' species in the PSA analysis (as per PF4.1.4), the team shall not assign a final PI score greater than 80.

PF5.3.2.2

If the team has opted to use the species-grouping option (as per PF4.1.5), the team shall not assign a final PI score greater than 80.

PF5.3.3 If there are no main species, and minor species are not scored using the RBF (as per PF2.1.3), the team shall cap the final PI score at 80.

The team shall record the CA, PSA scores (equivalent MSC score) and overall MSC

- PF5.3.4 scores in the Scoring Tables in the 'MSC Reporting Template'.

## PF6 Setting conditions using the RBF for Species PIs

## PF6.1 PIs 1.1.1, 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1

PF6.1.1 If any scoring element score is less than 80, the team shall set a condition on that PI.

PF6.1.2

If a condition is set for a PI scored using the CA or PSA, the team shall make sure that the Client Action Plan proposed by the fishery client meets the following criteria: ◙

- a. Is capable of raising the score to 80.
- b. Addresses all the scoring elements for which the score falls below 80.
- c. Does not cause additional associated problems for other species.

PF6.1.3

The team shall only apply the RBF to the UoA in subsequent MSC assessments if the score is 80 or above at the point of entering reassessment.

PF7.1.3

The team shall conduct the CSA for each data-deficient scoring element.

PF7.1.4 The team may elect to conduct the CSA on 'main' habitats only. ◙

PF7.1.4.1 If the team decides to consider 'main' habitats only, the final PI score shall be adjusted downward according to clause PF7.6.5.

PF7.1.5 The team shall apply expert judgement throughout the CSA.

PF7.1.6 When scoring, the team shall consider the full range of possible interactions, and take a precautionary approach, scoring the highest possible risk score of the relevant ranges, if: ◙

a. Possible scores from fishing activity or impact cut across more than 1 threshold range or more than 1 proxy range.

- b. Gear has been modified in a way that could increase its impact.

## PF7.2 Stakeholder involvement within the CSA ◙

PF7.2.1 The team shall use input from stakeholders to:

- a. Assist in the identification of the habitat(s) that are affected by the UoA.
- b. Assist in the scoring of the consequence and spatial attributes within the CSA.

## PF7.3 CSA Step 1: Define the habitat(s)

PF7.3.1 The team shall list and define each habitat associated with the 'managed area'.

PF7.3.1.1

The team shall interpret the term 'managed area' to mean each habitat in the full area managed by the governance body(s) responsible for fisheries management in the area(s) where the UoA operates

PF7.3.1.2

The team shall refer to the MSC Fisheries Standard SA3.13.5 and the subclauses to further interpret the term 'managed area'.

PF7.3.1.3

The team shall treat each habitat within the UoA as a scoring element.

## PF7.4.7 The team shall use Table PF14 and Table PF15 to score the gear-habitat interaction attributes. ◙

PF7.4.7.1 If the UoA's gear type is not provided in Table PF14 and Table PF15, the team shall score the attributes using the most similar gear in terms of extent of bottom contact that is provided.

- a. The team shall be precautionary when determining the most similar gear type.
- b. The team shall provide justification for the selection of the most similar gear type.
- c. The team shall provide justification for the selection of the most similar gear type.

## Removability of biota

PF7.4.8

The team shall score this attribute on the basis of the likelihood of attached biota being removed or killed by interactions with fishing gear (Table PF14). ◙

PF7.4.9

The team shall consider removability and mortality of structure-forming epibiota and bioturbating infauna.

PF7.4.10 The team shall record the 'removability of biota' score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## Removability of substratum

PF7.4.11 The team shall score this attribute on the basis of clast (rock fragment or grain resulting from the breakdown of larger rocks) size and likelihood of the substratum being moved (Table PF14).

PF7.4.12

The team shall consider the gear type being assessed.

PF7.4.13 The team shall record the 'removability of substratum' score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

PF7.4.16 The team shall record the 'substratum hardness' score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## Substratum ruggedness

PF7.4.17

The team shall score this attribute on the basis of the extent to which available habitat is actually accessible to mobile gear given the ruggedness of the substratum (Table PF15).

PF7.4.18

The team shall consider the characteristics of the substratum and the gear type being used.

PF7.4.19

The team shall record the 'substratum ruggedness' score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## Seabed slope

PF7.4.20 The team shall score this attribute on the basis of the impact to habitat that occurs as a result of slope steepness and mobility of substrata once dislodged (Table PF15).

PF7.4.21 The team  shall consider the degree of slope.

PF7.4.22

The team shall record the 'seabed slope' score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## PF7.5 CSA Step 3: Score the spatial attributes ◙

## Gear footprint

PF7.5.1

The team shall score this attribute on the basis of the gear's potential for disturbance and the number of encounters required to produce an impact on a habitat (Table GPF10), taking into account the size, weight, and mobility of individual gears and the footprint of the gears (Table PF16). ◙

PF7.5.1.1

If the UoA's gear does not fit into the encounter categories in Table GPF10, the team shall provide justification for increasing or decreasing the default gear footprint score.

PF7.5.2 The team shall apply PF7.4.7.1 and its subclauses here.

## Spatial overlap ◙

PF7.5.4 The team shall score this attribute on the basis of spatial overlap between the habitat(s) distribution within the 'managed area' (see PF7.3.1.1 and PF7.3.1.2) and the distribution of areas fished by the UoA (Table PF17). ◙

PF7.5.5 The team shall record the spatial overlap score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## Encounterability ◙

PF7.5.6 The team shall score this attribute on the basis of the likelihood that a fishing gear will encounter the habitat within the 'managed area' (see PF7.3.1.1 and PF7.3.1.2), taking into account the nature and deployment of the fishing gear and the possibility of its interaction with the habitat (Table PF17). ◙

PF7.5.7 The team shall record the encounterability score for each habitat in the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## Aggregate spatial score

## PF7.5.8 The team shall determine the aggregate spatial score by using the 'MSC RBF Worksheets'.

## PF7.6 CSA Step 4: Determine the CSA score and equivalent MSC score ◙

PF7.6.1 The team shall use the 'MSC RBF Worksheets' to calculate the overall consequence and spatial scores, the CSA score and the MSC CSA-derived score for each scoring element

(habitat).

PF7.6.2 The team shall convert the MSC CSA-derived score into a final MSC score for PI 2.4.1.

PF7.6.2.1 If there is only 1 scoring element (habitat), the team shall:

- a. Convert the MSC CSA-derived score for the single scoring element into the final MSC score.
- b. Round the final MSC score to the nearest whole number (e.g. 87).
- c. Record the final MSC score in the Scoring Tables in the 'MSC Reporting Template'.

If there is more than 1 scoring element and each scoring element has the same MSC CSA-derived score, the team shall:

- a. Convert the MSC CSA-derived scores for the scoring elements into the final MSC score (e.g. if they are all 64, the final MSC score is 64).
- b. Round the final MSC score to the nearest whole number.
- c. Record the final MSC score in the Scoring Tables in the 'MSC Reporting Template'.

If there is more than 1 scoring element and each scoring element has different MSC CSA-derived scores, the team shall:

- a. Derive the final MSC score by applying the rules in Table PF18.
- b. Assign the final MSC score in an increment of 5 (e.g. 60, 65, 70).
- c. Record the final MSC score in the Scoring Tables in the 'MSC Reporting Template'.

PF7.6.3 If the MSC CSA-derived score of any scoring element is less than 60, the team shall fail the PI.

- PF7.6.4 If no additional information exists to score the PI, the team shall apply the MSC CSAderived score directly to the PI within the 'MSC Reporting Template' and provide a justification.
- PF7.6.4.1 If there is additional information regarding the attribute(s) that justifies modifying the MSC CSA-derived score either upwards or downwards by a maximum of 10 points, the team shall use this information to reach the final MSC score for the PI.

◙

- a. The team shall use all information that is available on the UoA to inform the assessment.
- b. The team shall provide the justification for any score modification.

PF7.6.5 If the team has only considered 'main' habitats in its CSA analysis (as per PF7.1.4), the team shall not assign a final MSC score to the PI greater than 95, reflecting the fact that only the 'main' habitats were assessed.

## PF7.7 Setting conditions using the CSA

PF7.7.1 If any scoring element score is less than 80, the team shall set a condition on the PI. ◙

- PF7.7.1.1

If a condition is set on a PI that was scored using the CSA, the team shall make sure that the proposed Client Action Plan meets the following criteria:

## PF8.8 Scoring PI 2.5.1 using the RBF

PF8.8.1 The team shall use the SICA score to determine the final score for PI 2.4.1.

PF8.8.2

The team shall consider whether there is additional information to score the PI.

PF8.8.2.1

If there is no additional information, the team shall apply the converted score directly to the PI with the accompanying scoring template and a rationale provided as justification.

PF8.8.2.2

If there is additional information that justifies modifying the MSC score either upwards or downwards by a maximum of 10 points, the team shall use this information to reach the final MSC score for the PI. ◙

PF8.8.2.3

The team shall use all information that is available on the UoA to inform the assessment.

PF8.8.2.4

The team shall provide the justification for any score modification.

PF8.8.2.5

The team shall record all changes to the score and rationale for the changes.

PF8.8.3

The team shall record the final PI score in the SICA table in the 'MSC Reporting Template'.

## PF8.9 Setting conditions using the RBF (PI 2.5.1)

PF8.9.1 If any score is less than 80, the team shall set a condition on that PI.

PF8.9.1.1

If a condition is set for a PI that was scored using the SICA, the team shall make sure that the Client Action Plan proposed by the fishery client is capable of raising the score to 80.

PF8.9.1.2

The team shall only apply the RBF to the UoA in subsequent MSC assessments if the score is 80 or above at the point of entering reassessment.

## Introduction to this document

The Guidance to the MSC Fisheries Certification Process (GFCP) is provided help conformity assessment bodies (CABs) interpret the Fisheries Certification Process (FCP). The GFCP is maintained as a separate document.

The headings and numbering in the GFCP, when included, match those in the FCP exactly, with numbers prefaced with the letter 'G' to indicate guidance.

The MSC recommends that CABs read the FCP in conjunction with the GFCP. Text in the FCP is not repeated in the GFCP.

Where guidance is provided that generally relates to the subject of a section, or relates to the content of a specific clause, this icon ◙ appears at the end of the section title or clause in the FCP. These icons provide hyperlinks to the related guidance section in the GFCP.

Within the GFCP, this icon ▲ provides a hyperlink back to the corresponding section or clause in the FCP.

## Auditability of the Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process

The guidance in the GFCP is not directly auditable.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process

<!-- image -->

## Guidance to implementation timeframes ▲

The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) does not expect the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) to change between versions of the MCS Fisheries Certification Process (FCP) during any assessment or audit process.

## G4 General requirements

<!-- image -->

## G4.2 Consultation requirements ▲

Stakeholder consultation is a critical component of the MSC fisheries assessment process, as:

- · A robust stakeholder consultation process is fundamental to conducting a high-quality assessment.
- · Stakeholder input provides important information to assessment team members and the CAB.
- · Stakeholder input contributes significantly to the credibility and outcome of the assessment process.

The MSC's intent for stakeholder consultation throughout the FCP is to ensure:

- · Early identification of relevant stakeholders, each of whom are given adequate opportunity to provide their views during relevant stages of the assessment.
- · Issues raised by stakeholders are acknowledged and reported as early in the assessment process as possible to provide maximum opportunity for resolution.
- · Comments from stakeholders are targeted and relevant to each assessment.
- · Responses from the CAB are presented in a way that makes it easy to see how, where, and why the comments have (or have not) been considered.

## Awareness of cultural norms and technical capacity of stakeholders

Different consultation mechanisms may be best for different stakeholders. To ensure stakeholders are provided adequate opportunity to comment on the assessment, the stakeholder consultation process should be designed and carried out in a way that is culturally and technically appropriate for each stakeholder. This may inform how stakeholders are consulted.

Awareness of cultural norms and expectations and the technological capabilities of those to be consulted will contribute to the design and implementation of an appropriate and successful consultation process. For example, there may be specific acceptable channels through which to approach community or tribal leaders, or elected officials. Ignorance or insensitivity regarding these factors, even though unintended, may cause embarrassment or offence to the parties, the CAB, and/or the MSC, and may seriously undermine efforts to obtain useful input.

It is important to understand the technical capacity of individuals or organisations, particularly regarding communications mechanisms such as email, telephones, and videoconferencing. For example, in some circumstances it may be inappropriate to require written input or refer someone to a website for information. In some situations, communication services may be unreliable, or fishers may be at sea for extended periods and unable to communicate promptly. It is also important to understand and consider cultural sensitivities when contacting and planning meetings with different stakeholders.

## Contacting stakeholders

Throughout the FCP, where there is a requirement that stakeholders are contacted, neither the uploading of a document for publication on the MSC website nor the inclusion of a notification in the MSC Fisheries Updates email should be viewed as a substitute for the CAB directly contacting a stakeholder.

## G4.2.2 Identifying stakeholders ▲

The MSC takes an inclusive approach when considering the definition of a stakeholder. A stakeholder is a group or individual who may affect or be affected by the outcome of an MSC fisheries assessment. Stakeholder groups may vary from one assessment to another, but will generally fall under these 2 categories:

- 1. Organisations or individuals who can provide information that is relevant to the assessment.

- 2. Organisations or individuals who may be affected by the outcome of an assessment.
- o This includes individuals and organisations that have expressed a particular interest in the assessment, the fishery being considered for certification, or in other resources potentially affected by the fishery.

The only exception to this in MSC fishery assessments is that the organisation seeking certification is considered the client, rather than a stakeholder. The client provides information and input into the assessment in other ways (for example, via the 'MSC Client Document Checklist').

Typical stakeholders may include:

- · Government agencies (with direct fishery management, research responsibility or responsibility for related resources or research).
- · Non-governmental conservation or other public interest organisations (these may be local, regional, national and/or international organisations).
- · Academic researchers.
- · Adjacent or potentially affected fisheries (other than the client fishery) or other potentially affected commercial interests (e.g. the post-harvest sector).
- · Community or tribal entities or individuals.

The team should compile a list of potential stakeholders at the start of the assessment or surveillance process. The approach to identifying stakeholders will differ from one assessment or audit to another. As a starting point, the following steps can be taken:

- · If a pre-assessment was undertaken, any stakeholders identified in the pre-assessment process should be included on the stakeholder list.
- · The CAB should ask the client for a list of potential stakeholders. The client will typically have a good idea of the primary parties who have shown interest in the fishery at the local, regional, national and/or international levels. The client is also a good first source of information about any cultural or political issues or sensitivities that should be considered when planning stakeholder consultation. To ensure the client does not withhold information, either intentionally or unintentionally, the CAB should inform the client about:
- o Who can be considered a stakeholder in the context of an MSC fishery assessment.
- o The importance of engaging stakeholders, including those who may be critical of the fishery.
- o The risk of objections if stakeholders are not provided with adequate opportunity to comment during the early stages of an assessment.
- · The CAB should make use of organisational knowledge, including the experience of their assessors, when identifying stakeholders (for example, by considering the stakeholders who expressed interest in similar or nearby assessments).
- · The CAB may contact the MSC to seek information about stakeholders to consider including on the initial contact list. MSC regional staff are often knowledgeable about the stakeholders interested in certain fisheries and may be able to provide information about national and international interest groups (particularly industry, conservation, government entities, academics and technical experts) who have a history of interest in the fishery in question or a similar one, or in issues that could emerge in the fishery under examination. The MSC cannot, however, provide an exhaustive list of stakeholders for use in the assessment.

Other sources of information that could inform stakeholder lists may include coverage of the fishery or specific fishery issues in the media, interest group publications, and the public record.

Prior to the site visit being announced, the CAB should contact the identified stakeholders to coordinate a date for the site visit that ensures the highest level of attendance. There may be some instances where identified stakeholders cannot be engaged ahead of announcing the full assessment; in such instances, the CAB may choose to postpone the announcement of the site visit date until these stakeholders have been engaged in the process.

## G4.2.3 Consultation announcements ▲

Consultation announcements should be sent at the start of each consultation period. Consultation periods include the following:

- · Announcement of a fishery assessment or reassessment.
- · Announcement of use of the risk-based framework.
- · Announcement of the Public Comment Draft Report.
- · Announcement of the Final Draft Report.
- · Surveillance audit announcement.
- · Scope extension announcement.

'Relevant stakeholders' should be taken to mean all identified stakeholders, expect for during consultation on the Public Comment Draft Report and Final Draft Report, at which stage only registered stakeholders should be contacted.

As part of consultation announcements, CABs can ask stakeholders contacted to confirm the following, as appropriate to the consultation period:

- · Whether they are interested in providing input on the report or attending the site visit.
- · If an organisation is identified, who the most appropriate contact in the organisation is for matters relating to the fishery assessment or audit.
- · If an individual representing an organisation has been contacted, that the individual is the most appropriate person in the organisation to be contacted.
- · If they are aware of any other stakeholders who should be contacted.

For announcements of fishery assessments or reassessments, stakeholders should be informed that to engage with the assessment, they must provide comments on the Announcement Comment Draft Report or attend the site visit.

## G4.2.4-5 MSC Templates for Stakeholder Input into Fishery Assessments ▲

The main purpose of the MSC stakeholder input templates is to enable interested parties to easily track how the team considers input provided by stakeholders and incorporates the input into assessments. This ensures that stakeholder input and CAB responses are reported transparently.

<!-- image -->

## G4.2.9 Registering stakeholders ▲

Stakeholders should be considered 'registered' in an assessment if they provide written input on the Announcement Comment Draft Report or provide written or verbal input at the site visit for the ongoing assessment. If stakeholders do not participate during the site visit or comment on the Announcement Comment Draft Report, they cannot comment during later stages of the assessment. At each surveillance audit, and at the start of each reassessment, the full list of stakeholders should be revisited, any new stakeholders added, and all stakeholders should be contacted again and offered the opportunity to provide input.

The CAB is encouraged to have stakeholder management systems in place to ensure the correct stakeholders are contacted and provided with adequate opportunity to comment during each part of a fishery assessment. These management systems may go above and beyond the requirements and guidance set out in the FCP and GFCP.

If stakeholders do not wish to actively engage with a fishery assessment but would like to be kept updated about progress on the assessment, the CAB is encouraged to support this. Stakeholders can sign up for MSC Fisheries Update emails to keep track of assessments and can also keep up to date with progress on the MSC Track a Fishery website.

## G4.4 Access to information

<!-- image -->

## G4.4.1 Key information ▲

The CAB should interpret 'key information' to mean information that is essential for a stakeholder to have access to so that they are able to properly review the logic that the team has used in scoring rationales.

For information that is available online, the CAB should provide a full reference to make it easy for stakeholders to find this information. Where possible, the CAB should include a hyperlink, and include additional details that can be used to find the information if the hyperlink breaks.

If peer-reviewed literature that is not open access is cited within a public assessment report, the CAB should provide the details required for a stakeholder to find and gain access to the peer-reviewed literature. However, the CAB is not expected to provide this access themselves.

<!-- image -->

## G4.4.1.1 Unpublished information ▲

The CAB can use the 'Supporting Information' annex within the reporting templates to make available information that is unpublished or not online. Alternatively, the CAB may make the information available by sharing it directly with stakeholders and the Peer Review College on request.

## G7 Process requirements ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.1.7 Communication CAB-client ▲

The CAB should inform the client that failure to prepare properly - if the relevant information is not available, or if critical issues have not been addressed - might mean that the UoA could fail assessment.

<!-- image -->

## G7.1.8 Information collection related to MSC pre-assessments ▲

The information provided may be aggregated and publicly reported on the MSC website to show regional pre-assessment activities without revealing either the CAB or client identities or other specific fishery details.

This reporting allows the MSC to monitor the number of fisheries that are engaging with the MSC process in different regions of the world and assess the proportions of those fisheries that subsequently enter (as opposed to those who do not enter) full assessment. The example report (Table G1) provides information from the same CAB for a later year and includes a status update for a previously reported pre-assessment.

## G7.3 Client Document Checklist ▲

The intent of the Client Document Checklist is to ensure that all available information needed to complete the Announcement Comment Draft Report has been collated.

## G7.4 Confirmation that the UoA is within scope of the MSC Fisheries Standard ▲

## Background

This section contains a series of actions required to be undertaken prior to the CAB confirming the scope of the assessment. These actions include:

- · Ensuring that the UoA is within scope of the MSC Fisheries Standard.
- · Reviewing pre-assessment reports and other information.
- · Confirming the proposed units of assessment and certification.
- · Determining whether the UoA has previously failed an assessment.
- · Determining whether the certificate may be shared with fishers not initially part of the client group.
- · Determining whether inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) stock(s) are caught.
- · Determining whether the UoA is an enhanced fishery.
- · Determining whether the UoA overlaps with another MSC certified or applicant UoAs.
- · Determining whether the UoA is based on an introduced species.
- · Determining eligibility of fishery applicants and certificate holders with respect to the MSC Labour Eligibility Requirements.

Once this process is completed based on the above criteria the scope of the assessment is confirmed.

Actions associated with this analysis are generally focused on information gathering and preparatory steps required before the team can be formed, the assessment tree can be confirmed and the assessment and scoring of the UoA can be undertaken. It is designed to provide robust and consistent assessments and maintain the integrity of the MSC Program.

## G7.4.7 Process of removing a vessel from an MSC certified UoA ▲

Figure G1 outlines the process for the CAB to follow if the client or client groups informs the CAB that a vessel has been removed in relation to 7.4.8.5. Examples the figure gives are for illustrative purposes only.

If a vessel has been excluded or removed from a Unit of Certification (UoC) due to a scope issue related to 7.4.8.5, that vessel may request to re-enter the UoC once it can demonstrate that 2 years have passed since its exclusion or removal. In this instance, the CAB should follow the requirements in Section 7.27.

In cases where fishing operations are not vessel-based, the requirement should be interpreted to mean the exclusion of the individual fishing operator that undertook a shark finning offence.

## G7.4.8.5 Conviction for shark finning ▲

To confirm scope, a CAB should check with relevant management authorities and compile any other relevant data to confirm that no conviction which confirms guilt with respect to a violation of shark finning law has occurred in the last 2 years.

The intent of this requirement is that it should apply to specific vessels or groups of vessels as defined under 7.24.7.1, which are implicated in the conviction with the legal entities (e.g. individuals or companies that have been convicted for shark finning offences).

## G7.4.8.6 Controversy - disputes ▲

As part of Principle 3 of the MSC Fisheries Standard, the UoA is required to incorporate an appropriate mechanism for the resolution of disputes arising within the system. It is worth noting that outstanding disputes of substantial magnitude involving a significant number of interests will normally disqualify a UoA from certification. However, the existence of controversies or disputes are of themselves not enough to stop a UoA from being eligible for certification. The existence of lawsuits are not considered a barrier to certification, otherwise parties opposed to certification could simply

lodge lawsuits to prevent an outcome they did not support. The judgement should be whether a dispute compromises the ability of the management system to provide sustainable management.

Note that a UoA could pass the 3 points in 7.4.8.6.a with stakeholders having used the mechanism for resolving disputes but remaining unsatisfied with the outcome.

## G7.4.8.7 Enhanced fisheries ▲

The MSC's primary focus is on ensuring the long-term viability of global fish populations and the health of the aquatic ecosystems upon which they depend. The MSC has included some methods of fishery enhancement within the MSC Program but has specifically excluded aquaculture. The MSC's intent is to enable certain defined types of enhanced fisheries to be eligible for certification against the MSC Fisheries Standard while maintaining this focus.

Given the wide range of types of enhanced fishery that may seek to enter the MSC Program, the MSC recognise that existing certification requirements and guidance may require modification for the assessment of enhanced fisheries, through the development of additional (or modification of existing) Performance Indicators and Scoring Guideposts.

## Categories of enhanced fisheries

Table 1 defines the criteria by which enhanced fisheries may be identified as being within the scope of the MSC Program. The categories of potential within-scope enhanced fisheries are as follows:

- · Hatch and catch (HAC) : This production system may be considered within scope in certain circumstances, reflecting the established case history and precedent set by the hatcherystocked salmon fisheries. For these types of fishery, more intensive culture activities may be allowed as long as they only apply to a brief period within the species' life cycle.
- · Catch and grow (CAG) : This production system's grow-out and holding systems may be considered within scope under certain conditions. CAG has some features of intensive aquaculture - requiring routine inputs, such as feed, chemical or medicinal treatments - that are outside of scope. CAG systems that only require limited enhancement (e.g. rope culture of bivalves) may be considered within scope for the entirety of their operation.
- · Habitat-modified : This production system involves the modification to habitat, such as salmon fry farms located next to river systems.

A single UoA may display several of the features of CAG, HAC or habitat-modified fisheries. In the application of MSC requirements, it is intended that any overlap between categories should not become complicating factors in determining whether a given UoA is within or outside scope. Distinctions are drawn in some cases between applications of the criteria to these different categories.

For enhanced fisheries, only the part of the catch that is clearly landed during the catching operation (e.g. permanently removed from the water by the fishery) would be eligible to enter into MSC certified chains of custody. The part of the catch that is clearly landed would be subject to the normal chain of custody and fishery traceability requirements. Operations in which no part of the catch is clearly landed are considered inseparable from any subsequent 'grow-out' phase and the scope criteria for enhanced fisheries apply to the operation in its entirety.

The MSC requirements allow for enhanced fisheries that are interested in initiating an MSC assessment to commence the process prior to the completion of further MSC requirements and guidance since:

- · Some enhanced fisheries may be able to proceed with assessment against the existing default tree.
- · Other enhanced fisheries may be considered in scope but require additional guidance and/or Performance Indicator Scoring Guideposts to be scored.
- · The performance assessment issues that would be expected to be covered by these modifications for each category of enhanced fishery are outlined below.

## Scope criteria A: Linkages to and maintenance of a wild stock

Given the MSC focus on the sustainability of global wild fish stocks, the concept of 'wildness' plays a central role in scoping enhanced fisheries.

The UoA should incorporate some element of harvest of a wild population and should be managed so that the natural productivity and genetic biodiversity of that population is not undermined with respect to any impacts on long-term sustainability.

Linkages to wild stocks may exist either in HAC systems where marine species are raised to a larval or juvenile stage in captivity and then released into and harvested from a wild stock or CAG systems where species are harvested as juveniles or young adults from the wild and then raised in captivity until they are sold on to the market.

## Scope criteria B: Feeding and husbandry

The criteria included in this group emphasise the main focus of the MSC on harvest of wild species. Production systems that show characteristics more consistent with closed and/or intensive aquaculture are out of scope.

Feeding is a fundamental requirement in most intensive aquaculture systems and thus provides a clear means for distinguishing between wild- and farmed-production systems. The framing of the scope criteria distinguishes between the use of feeding for a short initial period in HAC fisheries (e.g. stocked salmon fisheries) and the intent to exclude those CAG fisheries where feed inputs are used to achieve the greater part of the weight gain of the fish over their life cycle. Other CAG operations that rely on natural sources of feed (e.g. mussels and other bivalves) are thus considered potentially within scope against this criterion.

Criterion Bi allows for the certification of fish that are fed in captivity only for the purpose of maintaining condition once caught, as commonly practised in holding facilities for crustaceans prior to sale.

The application of criterion Bii specifically to CAG operations recognises that disease prevention and other measures to maximise survival may be routinely used in some HAC fisheries. Such practices are allowed within these systems to reflect the limitations on potential environmental impacts imposed by the short duration of the captive-growth phase. Such impacts shall however be included in the Principle 2 assessment in this type of UoA.

## Scope criteria C: Habitat and ecosystem impacts

Habitat modifications in enhanced fisheries can include both physical changes to the sea bed or river course and the use of a range of man-made structures associated with the rearing or capture of fish that are not strictly 'fishing gear'. In the first case, modifications can range from the construction of simple ponds in intertidal areas or river floodplains through to watercourse management measures aimed at improving spawning habitats. Examples of the second case are fish attracting and/or aggregating devices (e.g. FADs), lobster casitas and mussel culture ropes (in CAG systems). Such artificial habitat modifications either enhance the productivity of the fishery or facilitate the capture or production of commercial marine species.

## G7.5 Scope of assessment: Defining the Unit of Assessment and Unit of Certification ▲

MSC certification is specific to the fishery holding the certificate, defined as the Unit of Certification (UoC). The CAB may choose to assess a wider unit as the Unit of Assessment (UoA), to which the certificate may be extended under some circumstances. Both the UoC and UoA need to be defined at the start of assessment.

The MSC allows parts of a fishery (i.e. a combination of stock(s)/gear(s)/vessel(s)) to be certified even if the rest of the fishery is not certified.

## G7.5.2-3 Defining the UoA/UoC ▲

The UoC (i.e. the unit entitled to an MSC certificate) is defined as follows:

'The target stock or stocks (= biologically distinct unit(s)) combined with the fishing gear and vessel type(s) pursuing that stock.'

At its simplest, a single vessel with a single gear could be the UoC, although it is more likely that a number of vessels within the same fishery would form the UoC.

The UoA defines the full scope of what is being assessed and is therefore equal to or larger than the UoC. If it is larger this means it will include other eligible fishers. Such other eligible fishers exist in cases where a client enters assessment with the aim of initially certifying only part of a fishery (e.g. vessels owned by a single entity), but also wishes to have the possibility of expanding the UoC later by the mechanism of certificate sharing.

If the number of fishers within the UoA is greater than the number within the UoC then there are other eligible fishers. If there is any difference between the UoC and UoA, the CAB must communicate this clearly to the MSC and other stakeholders.

Sufficient information should be provided to fully define the scope of the UoA that is to be assessed. In some fisheries, for example, further information may be given on the specific fishing seasons and/or areas that are included. Details could also be provided on which fishing 'fleets' are covered, or licence categories, as used in the management of the UoA. 'Groups' of vessels could also be identified that are not full fleets, but still have some special characteristics, such as membership of an association, or a binding commitment to a code of conduct. In cases where an assessment is intended to cover all fishing activities on a stock within the national waters of a state, there may be no need to individually specify all the different fleets or varieties of vessels that are covered (although the diversity of such vessels and gears should then be considered in scoring). In some cases, individual vessels or groups of vessels owned by a particular client may also be named, if the scope of the assessment is limited to only these vessels.

In defining a UoA/UoC, stocks could be different species, or different 'more or less isolated and selfsustaining' groups within a species. UoAs/UoCs are usually defined for a single species (or stock) and the gear type(s) used to catch that species. The client may prefer more than 1 species, stock or gear type to be included in a UoA/UoC. The advantages of joint scoring in these cases (e.g. cost savings, simpler tracking in the Chain of Custody, etc.) may outweigh the possible risk that the failure of one element could result in the failure of the whole UoA.

## G7.5.2.b and G7.5.3.b Defining gear type(s) used in the UoAs/UoCs ▲

'Fishing gear' is defined as the tool with which living aquatic resources are captured. For MSC assessments, gear type is distinguished based on the physical configuration, rather than how the gear is deployed. For example, a beam trawl with sumwing can be classified as a different gear type than a beam trawl with tickler chains, because these have different configurations - in this instance, different accessory equipment. However, beam trawling on sandy bottom and beam trawling on rocky substrate would not constitute the use of different gears and both activities are required to be included in a single UoA.

## Single UoA/UoC with multiple gears

Where there are discrete variations in the type of gear used (such as 2 different mesh sizes used in a standard type of trawl gear), the CAB may include these within a single UoA. The CAB should clearly describe the gears and the variations, and consider these in the assessment and scoring (with any conditions included as normal for &lt;80 scores). If the UoA is certified, the CAB should monitor the use of each gear at surveillance to ensure that the effort applied to each has not changed to the extent that the impact of the UoA has also changed; if this occurs, the CAB should update the scoring. The client and the CAB should note that when 2 or more gear types are scored together, the lower score will determine the result. Decisions on the definition of the UoA should thus reflect the benefits of joint scoring against the risk of an individual analysis on a gear type resulting in a fail for all the others in the UoA.

## Single UoA/UoC with single gear

In cases where the UoA/UoC includes a single gear type, the CAB should consider whether there are any variations in use. If so, the CAB should:

- · Describe these variations and any potential differences in impact on Principle 2 components.
- · Monitor any changes in use at surveillance to ensure the full impact of the variations are considered in scoring.

Examples include, but are not limited to, variations in how the gear is deployed, or variations in type of bait used.

The UoA/UoC must include all activities undertaken for the specified gear. For example, a UoA where the gear type is purse seine it may be used in multiple ways, such as setting on a FAD or on a freeschool of fish. If the UoA employs multiple set-types, all set-types must be included in the UoA assessment of each gear type.

Such a flexible approach is allowed in order to minimise the complexity of assessment reports as far as possible while ensuring that all fishing impacts for the combined gear types/variations are fully assessed.

## Trading of catch quota between vessels

In cases where catch quota for certified fish stocks are traded between vessels, fleets or nations, such catches should be included within the UoA/UoC only if the recipient of the quota is already explicitly included within the UoA/UoC and/or recognised as a member of the client group or is itself certified and catches that fish in conformity with its own UoA/UoC.

Such trading of catch quota does not automatically grant the right to enter catches into MSC certified chains of custody, although this may be possible in the above circumstances.

The team should assess the impacts of fishing by any quota recipients consistent with the normal requirement that the Principle 1 assessment covers all impacts on the stock. Any changes in such access arrangements in an existing certified UoA should be considered during surveillance audits.

## Assessment of metapopulations within the UoA/UoC

The MSC requires that fishing activity on Principle 1 species is assessed at a level that is sustainable for the stock. However, the application of the 'stock' concept may vary depending on the knowledge available and complexity in management. 3

Generally, from the fisheries management point of view, a 'unit stock' can be defined as a group of fish that can be treated as a stock and managed as an independent unit, as long as the results of the assessment and the impact of management measures do not differ significantly from what they would be in the case of a truly independent stock. 4

In some cases, stocks may be structured as 'metapopulations' - systems in which local populations (= sub-populations) inhabit discrete habitat patches, and inter-patch dispersal enables both demographic connectivity and independence of local population (LP) dynamics 5 .

In these cases, the team should consider the connectivity between components of the metapopulation that defines the underlying source-sink dynamics, and thereby clearly define the actual unit stock that is to be assessed against Principle 1.

Connectivity patterns range from a well-mixed larval pool (maximal connectivity) at one extreme to a collection of closed self-sustaining populations (minimal connectivity) at the other. However, most situations are intermediate to these two extremes. Connectivity is rarely symmetrical, and larval flows between 2 subpopulations will nearly always be stronger in 1 direction with maximum asymmetry found in non-reproductive pseudo-populations (absolute sinks). Source-sink models describe a situation where larvae or adults from source locations supplement less-productive sink areas. In a sink location, reproduction is insufficient to balance local mortality, and the LP therefore persists only because it receives immigration from more productive sources. Source locations are considered net exporters of individuals whereas sinks are net importers of individuals.

The degree of self-recruitment and connectivity among sub-populations dictates the specific management required to achieve a sustainable harvest. Where management recognises a metapopulation, it may need to ensure that fishing effort and catches consider the abundance or biomass in each local population.

In cases where fisheries are targeting a mixture of LPs that cannot be clearly separated, a practical management approach may be to consider the whole metapopulation as the unit stock. In this case, more precautionary reference points or other adjustments to the harvest strategy may be needed to allow for uncertainties in the stock structure. However, where appropriate and justified, 1 or more LPs can also be designated as the unit stock(s) on which the outcome and harvest strategy components are to be assessed.

The team should be alert to the special issues of metapopulation in assessing a UoA. At the time of reporting on the fishery assessment, the team should include detailed information in the assessment report, clarifying whether the unit stock is based on 1 or more LPs or on a metapopulation as a whole. Details should be provided on the appropriateness of the level of assessment and management chosen, explaining:

- · In the case that management is based on the whole metapopulation, how it is expected to avoid local depletion.
- · If based on 1 or more local populations, whether these are believed to be sources or sinks, the relationship among subpopulations and how management avoids over-exploitation within both the selected local populations and more broadly in the whole metapopulation.

Table G2 describes the level of assessment expected and considerations for scoring the stock outcome and harvest strategy components of a unit stock for a normal 'single population' stock (case A), and for 3 different forms of metapopulations (cases B, C and D). Teams should note that 'harmonisation' between Principle 1 assessments would normally be expected only in cases where 2 fisheries are fully overlapping in their definition of the unit stock. Fisheries on 2 separate LPs within a wider metapopulation, for example, need not have harmonised outcomes.

## G7.5.4 Defining the UoA and UoC by subset of activities ▲

While the MSC allows a portion of the fishery to be certified, it does not allow the UoA nor UoC to be defined by a subset of activities undertaken with the stock(s)/gear(s) combination. For example, if assessing a fishery using a purse seine with multiple set types such as FAD-set and free school-set, the CAB should include all set-types within the UoA and UoC.

<!-- image -->

## G7.5.5 Definition of UoA at time of fishing ▲

The CAB should define the UoA based on the gears that are used. The CAB should not define a UoA based on the species caught as observed at the time of landing. The CAB should include in the assessment all potential impacts of the UoA from all hauls or landings that are defined as having been taken by the gear type and in the area defined in the UoA. The CAB should not define the UoA based on, for instance, a subset of hauls that are defined as targeting a Principle 1 species and for which a calculation of the proportion of the catch that includes that Principle 1 species is required.

## G7.5.6 Geographical area of the UoA ▲

This is a description of the geographical area within which the UoA is undertaken. It should include the following:

- · FAO Major Fishing Area, identified by name and two-digit code (www.fao.org/cwp-on-fisherystatistics/handbook)
- · Commonly used name for the body of water (e.g. North Sea).
- · Local fisheries management area (e.g. ICES divisions VI, VII, and VIII abc).
- · Stock region, which may be all or part of the biological stock unit assessed in Principle 1.

In defining the geographical area, the CAB should consider the fishery client's ability to track and trace to it, as per 7.5.9 (initial traceability risk assessment) and Section 7.17 (Determination of the traceability systems and point(s) at which fish and fish products enter further certified Chains of Custody).

## G7.5.7 Changes to UoC/UoA ▲

During an assessment, the CAB should limit changes to the UoA and proposed UoC to the target stocks identified for consideration under Principle 1, as per 7.15.3. The MSC recognises that stocks initially proposed as target stocks (and assessed under Principle 1) may be recategorised as in-scope species and assessed under Principle 2.

For example, a client may want to propose multiple species for consideration under Principle 1, but the CAB may not have sufficient information to confirm whether that species is best assessed under Principle 1 or Principle 2 until after the site visit. A CAB may therefore confirm the species to be assessed under Principle 1 after the site visit, to be formally confirmed within the Public Comment Draft Report, see 7.15.3.

It is not the MSC's intent that the CAB announces a provisional UoA and adds additional target stocks or gear types or makes other changes during an assessment except those in 7.15.3.

The CAB should consider whether any changes to the UoA or UoC made during an assessment will have an impact on the traceability and ability to trace and identify product to each UoC.

## G7.5.8 Withdrawing a UoA and proposed UoC during the assessment ▲

For fishery assessments with multiple UoAs and proposed UoCs, a client may decide to withdraw 1 or more UoAs and proposed UoCs during the assessment process, for example to remove a gear type.

## G7.5.9 Review of traceability factors ▲

The intent of this section is to assure that the UoCs are defined in such a way that it will be possible for the fishery client to trace and identify to them, in order to be eligible to sell product as MSC certified. The CAB will consider the risks which affect this as detailed in the clause. The risk of vessels outside the UoC fishing on the same stock is relevant where this is for commercial purposes (i.e. intending to sell on this catch rather than discard it). Other risks of substitution may occur between point of harvest and point of sale to any party not covered by the fishery certificate, for example transhipment of product between a catch vessel in the UoC and another vessel, or sale via auctions.

## G7.5.9.1 Notification of obligation to meet traceability requirements ▲

Fisheries may have systems in place to manage traceability but may not be fully aware of MSC traceability requirements until later in the assessment process, particularly if the UoC does not cover the entire fishery. The intent of this requirement is to enable clear communication with the client group so that they are aware of the traceability requirements early in the assessment process. Key traceability risks can be documented in the traceability section of the 'MSC Reporting Template', and the client will have more time to implement traceability solutions during the remainder of the assessment process.

## G7.5.10 Other eligible fishers and entities and certificate sharing ▲

The MSC has the following intent regarding its certification program and certificate sharing:

- · To minimise the number of overlapping assessments requiring harmonisation.
- · To encourage the largest proportion of fishers to enter at the start of the full assessment process, but when only a select group of fishers within a fishery wants to undertake MSC assessment, to allow them to proceed so as not to delay certification.
- · To ensure that the process is clear and transparent to interested parties.

This arrangement defines which other eligible fishers may gain access to the fishery certificate, if and when the fishery is certified.

Certificate-sharing mechanisms developed in existing MSC fisheries include a number of arrangements, such as the provision of unrestricted access to the certificate, providing that certification and surveillance costs:

- · Are shared fairly and equitably with all participants.
- · Are met through the payment of a landing levy or some other approach agreed within the client group, and/or
- · That all product is initially sold to the certificate holder.

The MSC recognises the role of individual fishery clients in devising mechanisms that are appropriate to their circumstances. There are no formal, mandatory arrangements for the development of certificate-sharing mechanisms.

The guidance below provides suggestions rather than directions to clients and their potential partners for their use and/or inclusion in any certificate-sharing mechanisms. The CAB may wish to provide the advice in Box G1 to fisheries.

## Box G1: The MSC's advice on allocating costs of certificate sharing

The MSC provides this non-binding advice to certificate holders on the sharing of certificate costs. The CAB may wish to provide this information to those involved in certificate sharing.

When a client allows access to a certificate and seeks proportional reimbursement of the initial costs paid either as a one-off payment or as an ongoing cost-sharing mechanism, this guidance suggests how these costs could be calculated. Costs may include the following:

- · Direct costs paid to a CAB.
- · Direct costs that the client incurs in managing or facilitating the assessment.
- · Cost of the client's time spent managing/facilitating the assessment process.
- · Risk premium, a maximum of 20% of the other assessment costs.

If costs additional to those identified above are included in the proposed certificate-sharing mechanism, they must be documented and justified in any and all communication about the proposed sharing mechanism.

Allowable costs would not be expected to include any grant or subsidy made to the client to cover the costs incurred during the assessment, except where a proportion of such grants or subsidies are subsequently repaid.

The direct costs and the time costs that the client incurs in managing or facilitating the assessment may either be costed directly from the client's accounts or estimated as a simple overhead rate.

Where the direct and time costs are to be estimated from the client's accounts, the CAB will make full details available to other fishers seeking to gain entry to the certificate. If audited accounts detailing these costs are required, the other eligible fishers will pay the costs incurred in conducting such audits. The cost of the client's time will be based on the earnings records for the individuals involved. The client will record and substantiate time inputs recorded.

Where the client's direct and time costs are to be estimated according to an overhead rate, this rate should not exceed 30% of the fees paid to the CAB. In this case, the following formula is suggested for calculating the overall cost to be shared:

(Costs x overhead) x risk premium

Where the rates for the overhead and risk premium are set at the proposed upper limits of 30% and 20%, respectively, the overall cost is calculated from the following formula:

((Direct cost paid to the CAB less any cost paid for a consultant) x 1.3) x 1.2

Costs (both for entry and maintenance to the certificate, including the fulfilment of conditions) would be apportioned to the new entrant(s) seeking certification in accordance to the mechanism. Examples could include, but are not limited to, a pro rata sharing of costs based on:

- · The number of vessels (or operators) or processing or marketing entities seeking entry as a proportion of those documented as originally included in the UoC, or
- · The quota held by the new vessel(s) (or operators) or processing or marketing entities seeking entry, as a proportion of those documented as originally included in the UoC, or
- · The increase in fishing power of new vessel(s) (or operators) or processing or marketing capacity seeking entry pro rata to those documented as originally included in the UoC.

If additional fishers or processing or marketing entities seek to join the certificate after an initial and successful certificate-sharing negotiation, a rebate may be due to those who joined the certificate previously. Alternatively, potential costs may be apportioned between all the fishers who are potentially eligible to share the certificate, and payments made by sub-sets of fishers only in proportion to their share of the overall costs (thus avoiding the need for rebates if other fishers join later). Such cost-sharing mechanisms will be detailed to stakeholders when an assessment is undertaken.

## G7.5.11 Inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) stock(s) ▲

The intent of the requirements for inseparable or practicably inseparable (IPI) stocks is to:

- · Create incentives to promote the improved management of non-target stock(s), for example to bring to Principle 1 level of performance or encourage adoption of a mechanism for catch separation.
- · Allow a defined and limited proportion of catches of IPI stock(s) to enter further certified Chains of Custody and use the MSC ecolabel.

The requirements for IPI stock(s) acknowledge that Principle 2 catch can be practicably inseparable from the Principle 1 catch during normal fishing operations. For example, the Principle 2 catch may be from a stock of the same species, or a closely related species. As an extreme example, the Principle 2 species may only be distinguishable by the number of gill rakers or the number of rays in the caudal fin. These requirements also acknowledge that, even when the Principle 2 catch is distinguishable, it may not be commercially feasible to separate the catch (i.e. significant modification to existing harvesting and processing methods would be required).

The intent of the IPI requirements is to incentivise management of these species to Principle 1 level, or to encourage adoption of a mechanism for separation. As a result, IPI is only valid for 1 certification period, unless the proportion is &lt;2%.

Requirements for IPI stock(s) are designed to improve consistency in the application of the MSC Fisheries Certification Process. The requirements on IPI stock(s) vary based on the percentage in the catch:

- · If the proportion of IPI catches to total target + IPI catches is less than or equal to 2%, the CAB needs to make an assessment that the UoA does not create a significant impact on the IPI stock but is not required to apply PA1.4.2. The CAB is also not required to make a further determination of status under Principle 2, although the IPI stock is effectively held to the same requirement as Principle 2 in that the UoA should not be creating a significant impact on the IPI stock.
- · If the proportion is greater than 2% and less than 15%, Annex PA is to be applied in its entirety, including an assessment against Principle 2 in-scope species Performance Indicators (PIs) and considering the impact of all fishing activity.
- · The CAB should take into account the variability of the catch composition over the last 5 years or fishing seasons. Depending on data availability and species characteristics, the team may choose a different length of the time series, but a rationale should be provided in all cases for the method chosen. Species characteristics may include life history (e.g. longevity or generation time), time scales of production variability (e.g. decadal-scale vs. shorter time frames), and regulatory periods that affect spatial distribution of the fishing activity. There should be a good understanding of the long-term average catch composition of IPI species.

Note that the MSC restricts the application of the requirements for IPI stocks to a fishery certification to 1 certification period. At reassessment, IPI stock(s) should:

- · Be separated from target stock(s), or
- · The proportion of IPI should be reduced to 2%, or
- · The IPI stock(s) should be assessed against Principle 1.

G7.7

Preparing for the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

G7.7.1

Fishery with enhanced stock ▲

<!-- image -->

## Background

The intent is that management systems exist to control exploitation rates on wild stocks in order to allow for self-sustaining, locally adapted wild stocks (i.e. adequate wild stock levels that can perpetuate themselves at harvestable levels on a continuing basis, consistent with Principle 1). The management of enhancement activities related to the fishery should not prevent the ability of wild stocks to sustain themselves at their optimum levels, according to their natural habitat-related and biologically based productive capacities.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.1.2.b Extent of translocations ▲

For these requirements, translocation does not include the transfer of species to outside the distribution of their native range. The latter should be considered as an introduction of a species, to be considered under MSC Fisheries Standard Annex SD.

The extent of translocation must be considered to ensure that the fishery enhancement programs predominantly utilise stocks or populations that are native to the natural production area from which the UoA's catch originates.

The means of confirming that fish are 'native' to a fishery production area (i.e. from within the 'natural range') may not be simple, except in cases where no movement occurs.

Performance Indicators (PIs) may need to be developed to determine the extent of movement within a range that can be considered to have acceptably low risks. Related performance assessment will require the identification of the 'natural production area' or genetic range of a stock.

Translocation of fish/shellfish in enhanced fisheries should ensure that fisheries maintain the diversity, structure, and function of the ecosystem on which they depend while minimising any adverse effects. Inadequately managed translocations of fish/shellfish between different areas may have both genetic and other impacts that need to be assessed (e.g. the spread of diseases between areas, or accidental species introductions).

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.1.2.c.i Other interventions  ▲

Currently, the MSC Fisheries Standard does not cover the issues of feed augmentation and the use of medicines or other chemical compounds.

Examples of other interventions used in catch and grow systems include:

- · Fertilisation to enhance natural food availability, or
- · Removal of predators or competitors, either to maximise capture or minimise post-capture mortality.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.1.2.d Habitat modification ▲

The cumulative impacts of multiple production operations, areas, facilities, systems, etc. within a geographical region must be considered.

For example, a small mussel rope facility may have minimal impact on the natural ecosystem's structure and function, but filling a whole bay with such structures may have much greater impacts.

Consideration is needed for those situations where an individual operation is the subject of an assessment under the MSC Program but is only 1 of several similar operations in a finite space. The assessment should consider whether the cumulative impacts of a particular production system are likely to cause serious or irreversible harm to the natural ecosystem's structure and function.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.3 Use of the risk-based methods for a data-deficient UoA ▲

The CAB should not use the RBF to score a PI unless the answer to any of the questions in Table 3 is 'no'. Where it is not yet clear whether a scoring element under either Principle 1 or Principle 2 meets the criteria in Table 3, the CAB should announce the use of the Risk-Based Framework (RBF) to stakeholders and plan the site visit assuming that an RBF assessment will be needed. See also GPF2.1.

For fish species, the CAB should treat stock status reference points as biologically based limits when using Table 3 to determine whether scoring elements are data-deficient.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.3.3 Data-deficient scoring elements ▲

The CAB should have a list of scoring elements within the UoA when making the decision on whether a PI is data-deficient or not. If a full list of scoring elements is not be known and/or may change following the site visit, the CAB should take this into account when making the decision as to whether the PI is data-deficient or not.

See Annex PF for more information on use of the RBF.

<!-- image -->

## G7.7.3.4 Uncertainties in stock definition ▲

In Table 3, analytical stock assessments are based on mathematical models that use defined theoretical biological underpinnings to develop reference points.

Empirical approaches use indicator data and make logical inferences about more technical reference points without drawing on mathematical model-based techniques.

Stock uncertainties are scored instead in the information or stock assessment PIs (1.2.3 or 1.2.4).

<!-- image -->

## G7.8 Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The MSC's intent is that the drafting of the Announcement Comment Draft Report is a desk-based exercise using information provided in the Client Document Checklist, but additional resources that are readily available can also be used. For an initial assessment, information available in preassessments or from Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) may be used. For a reassessment, information in the previous Public Certification Report and surveillance audit reports may be used. The Announcement Comment Draft Report provides indicative scoring and rationales, and identifies where more information is needed.

One of the objectives of the Announcement Comment Draft Report is to assist the site visit by facilitating stakeholder input to the assessment before the site visit. The Announcement Comment Draft Report also ensures the CAB, the client and stakeholders are better informed and prepared for the site visit.

The Announcement Comment Draft Report includes an initial review of traceability risks identified in the 'Client Document Checklist' stage, the proposed point of change of ownership of product to any party not covered by the fishery certificate, and the point from which subsequent Chain of Custody (CoC) certification is proposed. The full review of risks and mitigation, determination on eligibility of product, and additional description of traceability is completed after, and informed by, the site visit as per 7.17.

## G7.8.1 Preparing the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The MSC does not expect assessment teams to conduct stakeholder interviews or site visits for the purposes of completing the Announcement Comment Draft Report. If a CAB chooses to conduct stakeholder interviews or site visits during the drafting of the Announcement Comment Draft Report, this will not count towards meeting the requirements in Section 7.14.

## G7.8.2.g.i Harmonisation at the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲

The MSC's intent regarding preparation for harmonisation no later than the site visit is that the CAB identifies overlapping UoAs and the need for harmonisation, and informs the relevant CABs that harmonisation discussions might be needed after the site visit.

The MSC does not expect the team to have had harmonisation discussions with other assessment teams of overlapping fisheries to produce the Announcement Comment Draft Report.

<!-- image -->

## G7.10 Announcement of fishery assessment ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.10.4.b Pre-assessment reports uploaded to database ▲

The MSC will maintain confidentiality of pre-assessment reports. The client may require the MSC to sign a confidentiality agreement.

<!-- image -->

## G7.10.5.1 Modifications to the default tree ▲

The CAB should draft quantitative PIs, where appropriate. For example:

- · Potential biological removals (PBR) of marine mammals - where fishing activity does not impede the recovery rate of populations.
- · Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) - the UoA is at or above MSY or biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) or some other variation of an appropriate fisheries management reference point.

<!-- image -->

## G7.12 Peer Review College ▲

The MSC has set up a Peer Review College to fulfil the following objectives:

- · Increase the independence of peer reviews of fishery assessments.
- · Increase the quality and consistency of peer reviews, and the reliability of their use by CABs, stakeholders and independent adjudicators.
- · Not to increase, and if possible reduce, the cost of peer reviewers to fishery clients undergoing assessment.

The CAB will need to request peer reviewers from the College according to the requirements in Section 7.12. The operations of the College are described separately to this guidance. Peer reviewers will have similar competencies to auditors.

<!-- image -->

## G7.12.3.b Proposed peer reviewers after the site visit ▲

Following the site visit:

- · The Peer Review College will ensure that all registered stakeholders are proactively invited to comment on the potential conflicts of interest of the proposed peer reviewers for a period of 10 days.
- · The College will review any conflicts of interest highlighted by stakeholders, in accordance with the procedures outlined in the FCP.

If stakeholders do not agree with the Peer Review College's determination on conflict of interest:

- · They have the right to appeal to the Peer Review College who shall inform MSC within 10 working days.
- · The MSC will appoint a third party to conduct a review of the decision.
- · The MSC Executive will inform the Peer Review College of the outcome of the review.
- · The MSC Executive will provide instructions on how the Peer Review College should proceed.

Once the consultation and appeals process is complete and the Peer Review College has acted as directed by the third party, the CAB and stakeholders will be informed of the decision that no conflict of interest exists for the peer reviewers appointed to conduct the peer review.

<!-- image -->

## G7.12.5 Final decision peer reviewers ▲

The CAB can express a preference for individual reviewers to be contracted from a shortlist drawn up by the Peer Review College. However, the Peer Review College will make the final decision.

## G7.13 Stakeholder input on the Announcement Comment Draft Report ▲ G7.13.4 Publish stakeholder input on the Announcement Comment Draft

Report ▲

The CAB should upload the stakeholder input in a timely manner to the MSC database for publication on the MSC website. The purpose of publication is to keep the stakeholders informed before the site visit about what has been raised. Additionally, the stakeholder input is useful for the assessment team to prepare the site visit.

## G7.14

Site visits, stakeholder input and information collection ▲

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## G7.14.1 Additional site visits ▲

The team may require further site visits by 1 or more team members where:

- · Information is not available, or
- · The client or stakeholders have not assembled information in time for the first assessment visit to adequately assess and analyse the evidence.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15 Scoring the UoA ▲

## Background

This is the stage where the information gathered in the formal assessment is evaluated, and scores are assigned and justified.

Guidance for scoring the UoA using the RBF is given in Annex PF and its guidance. .

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.1-2 Scoring decision ▲

The MSC's intent is that the full team appointed by the CAB agrees the scoring of the UoA. Although individual team members may lead on the scoring of a particular Principle, their conclusions should be agreed in discussion with the team as a whole. Discussions on scoring may begin at the site visit. However, these discussion often cannot be completed until after the team has dispersed, when virtual interactions may be needed (e.g. by teleconference and exchange of emails).

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.5.1 Smaller scoring intervals ▲

Scores may need to be assigned in intervals smaller than 5 when considering the complexity generated by multiple scoring issues and scoring elements.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.7.3 Terms used ▲

In considering the scoring of individual PIs based on the performance of different scoring elements, the terms below should be used:

- · Few : Most of the scoring issues should be taken to indicate 'minority: majority' or 'less than half: greater than half' (e.g. if there were 3 or 4 scoring issues, the ratios '1:2' and '1:3' would be represented by the terms 'few: most').
- · Some : 'Some' should be taken to indicate a roughly equal split of scoring issues.

<!-- image -->

## G7.15.8 Weighting ▲

Table G3 below shows the default weighting when using the default tree.

This information can be found in the 'MSC Fishery Assessment Default Scoring Worksheet'.

## G7.15.9.1 Scoring rationale ▲

Rationale for all scores is required to be explicitly documented in the report's text.

## Example: Rationale for a score of 75 in Principle 2 (Primary species, Management PI 2.1.2)

The rationale for a score of 75 for PI 2.1.2 might read as follows:

There are 5 primary species.

- · For 3 of them, catch by weight of that species is less than 5% of the UoA's total catch so they would not be considered 'main'. For these species, there is a management strategy in place that:
- o Is primarily designed for the fisheries that target these 3 species.
- o Recognises limit reference points that are based on sensible assumptions about the stock.

Although there is evidence that this strategy works in similar fisheries, it has not been fully tested in this UoA, nor is there evidence yet that the UoA is achieving its objective to maintain these species at or around BMSY. None of the species is a shark so the shark finning scoring issue is not scored. All 3 species are landed and sold so the unwanted scoring issue is not triggered. As none of the species are 'main':

- o They all meet the SG80 requirements.
- o They meet the SG100 requirements for strategy.
- o They do not meet the 2 scoring issues on management strategy evaluation and implementation.

These 3 species would each score 85.

- · A fourth species (hake):
- o Is a major target species of high value to another fishery.
- o Is assessed and managed rigorously.
- o Makes up 20% of the UoA catch.
- o Has quotas applied to the UoA as well as to its major target fishery that are effectively monitored and enforced.
- o Is landed and sold so the unwanted scoring issue is not triggered.

This species meets the SG100 requirements.

- · The fifth species is a deepwater species that is:
- o Managed using reference points and robust harvest control rules.
- o Well above its point of recruitment impairment.
- o Not utilised, and most of the catch is thrown back with a high mortality rate.
- o Not a shark species.

The UoA has reviewed current measures to minimise capture of this species as well as other measures. A cost-effective and practical measure was identified, but it has not yet been implemented. This species meets all of the SG60 requirements and all but 1 of the SG80 requirements so would score 75.

Based on the Scoring Guideposts, in the above scenario, 3 of the species achieve a score of 85, 1 achieves a score of 100 and 1 achieves a score of 75. According to Table G7, all of the scoring elements meet the SG60 level, and most achieve higher performance at or exceeding the SG80 level. Only 1 does not achieve the SG80 level so using this table, the appropriate overall PI score would be 75. This is because as stated in 7.15.10.b, if any single scoring element fails to meet the SG80 level, the overall score for that element shall be less than 80 so that a condition is raised, regardless of whether any other elements are at the SG100 level.

The rationale for this scoring result is shown in tabular form below.

## G7.15.10 Terms used ▲

In considering the scoring of individual PIs based on the performance of different scoring elements, the terms below should be used:

- · Few: Most of the scoring elements should be taken to indicate 'minority: majority' or 'less than half: greater than half' (e.g. if there were 6 scoring elements, the ratios '1:5' and '2:4' would both be represented by the terms 'few: most').
- · Some: 'Some' should be taken to indicate a roughly equal split of scoring elements.

## Examples: scoring elements

- · Where most elements did not meet the SG80 level, indicating an overall score of 65, but generally scored high intermediate scores, a higher overall score would be appropriate (e.g. 70). However, if the elements score only low intermediate scores, a score of 65 or below would remain appropriate.
- · Where only a few elements failed to achieve the SG80 level, suggesting an overall score of 75, but achieved low intermediate scores, a lower score (e.g. 70) would be appropriate.
- · Where some elements met the SG100 level but some only met the SG60 level, suggesting a score of 70, it may be appropriate to reflect the very high performance of some of the elements with an upwards adjustment to 75.

## Scoring of minor species and habitats

For 'minor' species and habitats, SGs only exist at the SG100 level in some PIs (2.1.1-2.2.3, 2.3.1, and 2.3.3). When scoring such minor species or habitats as scoring elements, the team should assume that the SG80 level is met by default, such that the scores are simply based on how many of the scoring issues that apply to 'minor' (or all) species/habitats are met at the SG100 level.

<!-- image -->

## G7.16 Setting conditions ▲

## Background

Conditions provide for agreed further improvement in the UoA and provide one of the bases for subsequent audits. They are intended to improve performance against the MSC Fisheries Standard, in terms of target species status, maintenance of ecological function, and management system performance.

If scores of less than 80 are awarded, then measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bounded conditions of certification are prepared.

Conditions can relate to:

- · Reducing uncertainty.

- · Improving processes and/or implementation.
- · Reducing risk.
- · Improving outcomes.

These elements can be hierarchical and may be linked together in pursuing a longer-term outcome and potential continuous improvement.

<!-- image -->

## G7.16.2 Drafting conditions ▲

The CAB should draft conditions that articulate the outcome that needs to be achieved by the condition deadline. This should reflect the language used in the SG80 Performance Indicator Scoring Guidepost and draw upon relevant text in the MSC Fisheries Standard Annex SA clauses and guidance. The CAB should not simply repeat the SG80 Performance Indicator Scoring Guidepost.

<!-- image -->

## G7.16.6 Exceptional circumstances ▲

Exceptional circumstances should be applied:

- · When a condition is first drafted during assessment and before certification, or
- · At a surveillance audit if a new condition is raised.

## Examples: exceptional circumstances

Examples of exceptional circumstances are the time taken for:

- · Natural ecological functions and response times.
- · Relevant research to be funded, undertaken and published.

## G7.17 Assessment of the traceability systems and determination of the

point(s) at which fish and fish products enter certified Chains of Custody ▲

## Background

Fisheries often have robust systems in place to manage traceability, through regulatory or voluntary controls. However, these systems may not be sufficient for differentiating between certified and noncertified products, especially if the UoC only covers specific vessels or gear types. The intention of this section is to enable clearer documentation of the traceability systems in place for a certified fishery and to make clear how substitution risks are adequately controlled by the fishery client. This can be informed through the site visit and completed in the MSC reporting template after the site visit and before the Public Comment Draft Report.

The intent of this section is to ensure that all fishery assessment reports clearly:

- · Describe the systems that ensure product segregation and identification to the UoC for all activities and product movements covered by the fishery certificate.
- · Identify risks of substitution or mislabelling of certified products.
- · Explain how the traceability systems and controls in place mitigate these risks.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.1 &amp; 7.17.1.2  Traceability record keeping ▲

Traceability systems need to be sufficient to allow the fishery client to trace MSC certified sales back to the individual UoC. MSC may request the traceability records for a product traceback or an investigation into an MSC supply chain.

The client will need to trace back to an individual UoC, which means that segregation and identification to each UoC are needed. In some cases, segregation may not be practical throughout handling but will always be ultimately possible prior to or at the start of CoC. An example of this would be where visually distinguishable species (some covered by the UoC and some not) are caught together, and sorting by species happens upon landing. This assures that should a UoC voluntarily leave or be suspended, it is possible to continue trading certified product.

Records demonstrating traceability back to the UoC should be kept for at least 2 years where practicable, to allow a product from the supply chain to be traced back to the UoC.

Traceability records can be maintained by fishers, the fishery client group, auctions or other entities, depending on the management of the UoA and the point at which subsequent Chain of Custody begins.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.1.3 High seas transhipment ▲

High seas transhipment brings higher risks of substitution or mislabelling of MSC certified fish and fish products. Examples of sufficient systems for high seas transhipment include 100% observer coverage or independently verified electronic monitoring.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.1.4 and G7.17.6.e Risk factors and mitigation ▲

Mitigation measures can include existing regulatory and traceability controls, such as logbooks, but should consider whether these systems are sufficient to ensure traceability back to the UoC. If not, additional systems or controls may need to be implemented.

Several possible risk factors exist:

## · The possibility that non-certified gears are used within the UoA

This concerns cases where vessels within the UoA may use gear types that are not included in the UoC. This can happen on the same trip where certified gears are used, or can happen on different trips. This can lead to a greater risk of mixing between certified and non-certified product on vessels or at points of landing, and the UoA needs adequate systems in place to segregate and identify the certified catch from non-certified catch.

- · The possibility of vessels from the UoC fishing outside the UoC or in different geographical areas (on the same trips or different trips)

This concerns the potential for vessels to fish in non-certified geographical regions (which may also be affected by fishing-season or temporal restrictions). This can lead to a greater risk of mixing between certified and non-certified product on vessels or at points of landing. The UoA will need to demonstrate how traceability and control systems (such as VMS or logbooks) help to ensure that only product caught within the UoC will be identified and sold as MSC certified.

- · The possibility of vessels from outside the UoC or client group fishing the same stock

This concerns the likelihood that other, non-certified fishers may catch the same stock, which could produce higher risks of substitution or mislabelling at the point of landing or sale (for example, where certified and non-certified catches are sold at the same auction).

## · Transhipment, especially high seas transhipment

Where high seas transhipment occurs, Chain of Custody is needed unless there are independently verified systems to cover the fishing and receiving vessels for all transhipment events.

- · Any other risks of substitution between fish from the UoC and fish from outside this unit

This refers to any other points at harvest, on the vessel, during transhipment, or at points of landing or sale where there is the potential risk of substitution between non-certified and certified products. This also includes the presence of other nearby fisheries activities or other fisheries where non-certified product may be landed transhipped alongside certified catches. This

assessment should consider the presence of these risks and specifically how they are addressed by the traceability systems in place.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.6 Documented in the MSC reporting template ▲

Clear information on the UoC must be available to stakeholders and particularly any party purchasing certified product from the fishery client. The change of ownership relates to the first point of sale to any party not covered by the fishery certificate. Any specific conditions related to eligibility of product from the UoC to bear the MSC ecolabel should be clearly stated in this section (for example, if roe is not considered within the UoC).

If sales agents or non-fisher client group members are confirmed as included in the fishery certificate, Chain of Custody could be required to start from the point of sale by the sales agent or client group member, and these entities need to be assessed as per 7.17.1.1. All entities that handle or trade product between harvest and start of CoC (such as transhipment, unloaders, offloaders, storage and transport) will also be considered under 7.17.1.1.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.6.c Critical tracking events ▲

Critical tracking events are all events that need to be recorded in order to allow for effective traceability of products. The critical tracking events within the fishery certificate could include transhipment, offloading at landing, sorting at auction, or sale by sales agent.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.6.1 CoC auditor review ▲

The CoC auditor may be a member of the team and involved at each stage, or may be a reviewer who is only involved after the site visit in reviewing and making recommendations on improving clarity and detail of the traceability sections in the 'MSC Reporting Template'. The team can then edit the 'MSC Reporting Template' prior to publication of the Public Comment Draft Report and improve its clarity for buyers and other stakeholders interested in traceability.

<!-- image -->

## G7.17.7 Non-conforming product ▲

This clause provides consistency with the requirements for CoC certificate holders. Fisheries have a responsibility to ensure that any non-eligible (non-conforming) product that enters the supply chain is identified, and downstream supply chain companies are appropriately notified. For example, if product from outside the UoC is accidentally labelled or sold as MSC certified, the UoA would need to take action in line with this procedure.

<!-- image -->

## G7.18 Determination of eligibility date ▲

## Background

The MSC developed requirements on eligibility dates to clarify the date from when the MSC ecolabel could be used on fishery products caught before the eventual fishery certificate date, and to promote consistency of approach across fisheries. The intent of a flexible eligibility date is to:

- · Outline the situations under which fishery products caught before the date of certification of a fishery may be considered to have come from a sustainable fishery and be eligible for use of the MSC ecolabel.
- · Allow fisheries to use the MSC ecolabel and make claims for fish products that are sold after the fishery certificate is awarded, but that are caught before this date.
- · Ensure that the MSC Chain of Custody is maintained and that only products from certified fisheries use the MSC ecolabel.

<!-- image -->

## G7.18.1.1 Eligibility date ▲

The eligibility date needs to be included in the Public Comment Draft Report as per 7.20.3.k.

In cases where the UoC could potentially change (e.g. due to some regions or fishing gears being omitted at a late stage), or there could be further delays to the assessment process, the CAB may choose to set the eligibility date as the certification date, rather than the Public Comment Draft Report date.

In cases where the eligibility date is set before the certification date, the CAB will need to consider any potential traceability impacts, and risks including that of product from outside the UoC being incorrectly identified as under-assessment product. Accordingly, the CAB should verify traceability and identification systems before the eligibility date.

Fisheries handling under-assessment product should be aware of relevant requirements in the Chain of Custody Standard on identification and traceability of under-assessment product.

## G7.19.5.a Address peer reviewer comments by CAB ▲

The team should note that reviewers will have the right of reply to the team's conclusion during the Public Comment Draft Report stakeholder consultation in common with other peer review processes such as those used by scientific journals. The reviewer's reply would state whether they agreed or disagreed with the team's response, as this could assist with the MSC Disputes Process. The CAB would be able to include a response to any peer reviewer follow-up comments made on the Public Comment Draft Report in the Final Draft Report.

If any of the peer reviewers' comments are contradictory, the team should provide justified responses for each different comment. It may be possible that the team agrees with some of the peer reviewers' comments, but not all. The team should provide clear justifications for all of their responses, including references to the relevant MSC requirements (MSC Fisheries Standard and/or FCP), and any MSC interpretations or derogations, as appropriate.

The above also applies to the team's responses to 2 or more sets of stakeholder comments where these are interpreted as contradictory.

## G7.19.6 Report viewed by the client ▲

The client has up to 60 days to consider and respond to the report. If the client response is received before the end of the 60-day period and the peer review is complete, the CAB can move on to the next assessment stage without waiting for the full 60 days to elapse.

## G7.19.7 Preparation of the Client Action Plan by the client ▲

Specific parts of the Client Action Plan may cover more than 1 PI even though each PI must have its own condition. However, the Client Action Plan should refer to these specific conditions and their milestones.

The CAB should not be prescriptive about the means of meeting conditions. The fishery client may develop their own corrective actions and deal with a condition in their own way. The important points for the CAB are that the client must demonstrate to the CAB's satisfaction that a condition can be met and how the outcome or result will be (or has been) achieved.

## G7.20 Public Comment Draft Report ▲

## G7.20.4.1 References in Public Comment Draft Report ▲

The reference should include identifying details such as number, author, and date.

<!-- image -->

## G7.21 Determination ▲

The CAB should also refer to Section 4.6 of the MSC General Certification Requirements (GCR) and ISO 17065.

The determination is a recommendation the team makes to the CAB's decision-making entity.

## G7.22 Final Draft Report ▲

## G7.22.3 CAB response to stakeholder input ▲

During the 30-day Public Comment Draft Report consultation, registered stakeholders may provide follow-up comments to the CAB's responses to their previous input.

Registered stakeholders may also provide input at Public Comment Draft Report stage on issues they have not previously raised, providing that the information the comments are based on was available on or before the site visit.

Figure G2 illustrates the stages in the assessment process where stakeholders may provide input and the CAB should respond.

## G7.24.7.1 Fishery Certificate Statement ▲

The Fishery Certificate Statement may be included in the Fishery Certificate or made an annex to it. The advantage of a Fishery Certificate Statement or as annex is the ability to update it more frequently, e.g. changes with client certificate sharing agreement details, than the Fishery Certificate; while a Fishery Certificate is a statement of fact, the Fishery Certificate Statement can include more explanation.

The CAB should include all information from the 'MSC Reporting Template' Section 'Eligibility to enter Chain of Custody' into the Fishery Certificate Statement in order to provide sufficient information to CoC holders buying from the UoC.

If a negative determination is made, the CAB should be clear in the Fishery Certificate Statement that fish or fish products are not eligible to enter certified chains of custody.

The entities with access to the certificate referred to in this clause should include:

- · Vessels or fleets within the UoA or UoC.
- · Client group members, which may be fishers or other bodies such as processing companies.
- o If the client wishes to make the certificate available to non-fishing client group members at the exclusion of non-client group members, a list of named companies needs to be provided or linked to here.
- · Sales agents with the right to sell product on behalf of the fishery client into certified chains of custody.

## G7.24.7.1.e Other limits to eligibility ▲

The Fishery Certificate Statement should detail all exclusions to product eligibility that the client has defined, which could include:

- · Sale through the client group.
- · Product forms (e.g. fish meal) being excluded from eligibility.
- · Trip exclusions (e.g. the trips which go both inside and outside the UoC).
- · Landing processes where eligibility is verified (e.g. verifying catch area or gear).

The Fishery Certificate Statement may also include other information relevant to the first buyer. This could include:

- · Where CoC starts and from whom certified product can be purchased (e.g. relevant auctions, agents and/or client group members).
- · How product can be identified as certified when it enters the Chain of Custody. This is copied from the fishery assessment report including a description of documents or labels.

## G7.25 Certification decision and certificate issue ▲

A fishery certificate is the formal document that is issued to a fishery client as evidence that a fishery is certified against the MSC Fisheries Standard. The CAB should refer to certification decision-making entity requirements of the GCR and ISO 17065.

G7.26 UoA(s) that fail or withdraw from assessment ▲

## G7.26.4.1 Non-binding conditions ▲

The CAB should clearly report in the Client and Peer Review Draft Report (CPRDR) and subsequent assessment reports why conditions are non-binding. If, for any reason, there are scores changes

which result in the UoA passing after the Client and Peer Review Draft Report stage, the CAB should follow 7.19.6-7.19.9.

<!-- image -->

## G7.26.7 Reporting ▲

The following are to be provided in full and should not report only on elements revised between the initial and subsequent assessment of the UoA:

- · Announcement Comment Draft Report.
- · Client and Peer Review Draft Report.
- · Public Comment Draft Report.
- · Final Draft Report.
- · Public Certification Report.

## G7.27 Extension of scope of fishery certificate (scope extensions) ▲

## Background

This section provides for limited extensions to the scope of a fishery certificate, as requested by an existing fishery client, to include other fishing operations in the same area or an adjacent area. Such extensions may, for example, bring in a gear type or fleet of vessels that also targets the main Principle 1 species but was not included in the original assessment. The process also allows for the movement of a target species from Principle 2 to Principle 1, so that it can be included in the existing certificate. It is provided as an alternative, cost-effective assessment option for fishery clients in cases where a whole new assessment is not needed. In these instances, some form of certificate sharing will often be involved between the original and new fisheries.

<!-- image -->

## G7.27.1.b Confirming the fisheries' eligibility for extension ▲

The MSC default assessment tree identifies 9 assessment 'components', as listed below:

- · Principle 1 - Target species outcome (status); target species management.
- · Principle 2 - Primary species; secondary species; ETP species; habitats; ecosystems.
- · Principle 3 - Governance and policy; fishery specific management.

<!-- image -->

## G7.27.5.b Gap analysis ▲

The individual completing the gap analysis may use Table G8 below to provide justification for the outcome of the gap analysis to determine which assessment components are the same across the proposed UoA and the existing UoC(s).

## Example

The proposed UoA may have the same target stock, management system and gear but be fishing in a different geographical area and be taking a different mix of ETP species. If so, ETP PIs would have to be re-scored in the scope extension assessment.

## G7.27.7 Adding new 'other eligible fishers' ▲

Fishery clients sometimes fail to identify all of the possible 'other eligible fishers' who are included in an assessment even though their impacts have been assessed and taken into account when the existing UoA was scored. In this case, the CAB may extend the certificate to these 'other eligible fishers' as long as the team confirms that the impacts were included in the scoring of the existing UoA. In cases where the assessment did not include the other fishers (e.g. it was restricted to only a few of the members of the fishing fleet), this option does not apply, and the scope extension process of Annex PE should be followed to assess the additional impacts in Principle 2.

## G7.29.4.b &amp; 7.29.6.c Verification of information ▲

To assess fisheries against the verification of information criteria, the CAB should create a list of information, information resources and aspects of the UoA that need to be reviewed in the annual audit. For each item, the CAB should use Table G10 below to determine the likelihood that it will be able to access the required information remotely and that it can confirm veracity of the information.

In determining how fisheries meet the criteria on verification of information, the CAB may consider the type, nature and complexity of the UoA. Fisheries will be at different points on the spectrum from a very limited ability to a highly advanced ability to provide information remotely. The CAB should use its expert judgement and knowledge of the UoA to determine a surveillance level commensurate with the fishery client's ability to provide the information remotely for verification by the CAB.

| Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Action plan &amp; milestones                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Client commitment and CAB  evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Records on infringements and sanctions will continue to be maintained and analysed in subsequent years to monitor and refine the MCS plan.

The CAB will also be presented with effectiveness analysis.

The above assessment demonstrates that all required information can be provided remotely. Consequently, the CAB would present a detailed justification for each surveillance activity and the number of auditors that will carry out the surveillance as outlined in the following table:

## G7.29.8.1 Surveillance schedule ▲

The 6-month flexibility either side of the anniversary date allows:

- · Surveillance audits to align with key dates in the fishery management cycle.
- · Surveillance audits to align with the expected delivery of conditions according to the Client Action Plan.
- · The coordination of site visits with the surveillance audits of other nearby MSC fisheries, thereby minimising the inputs required from management agencies and stakeholders.

This flexibility means that some or all surveillance audits will not be held on the anniversary date of the certificate.

Regardless of revised surveillance audit timings, 4 surveillance audits are to be conducted before the expiry date of the existing certificate, see 7.29.9.

## G7.29.15.a.iv Changes to traceability ▲

Changes that affect traceability and the ability to segregate MSC from non-MSC product may be to:

- · The systems or tools used for traceability, and/or
- · The UoC(s).

The team should include this response and the review of the traceability change (as per 7.29.15.e.v) within the surveillance audit report as per the template.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.16.1.b 'Behind target' ▲

'Behind target' means that actions, outcomes, expected results or milestones have fallen behind the timeframes specified when setting the condition.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.16.1.b.i Remedial action ▲

Remedial action can include the CAB setting new milestones provided these are still expected to achieve the condition within the timeframes identified at the time of setting the condition.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.16.2 'Back on target' ▲

'Back on target' means meeting the original milestones or revised milestones (described in G7.28.16.1.b.i) within 12 months of falling behind.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.16.2.c &amp; G7.29.16.4.c Full assessment after suspension related to conditions ▲

The MSC's intent is that if a fishery client has failed to achieve a condition by its deadline, the fishery client is not allowed to enter the same UoCs, or entities in the UoC(s), into (re)assessment under either the same or an alternative name or alias where the effective intent is to extend the duration of the condition into a new certification period.

<!-- image -->

## G7.29.23 Completing the audit ▲

In line with ISO 17065 and ISO 19011 requirements, the CAB is required to have an audit plan established with clear timeframes. The plan is required to justify when evidence-gathering will take place in an audit process. During both on-site and off-site audits, the end of the evidence-gathering stage should be used as the start day for surveillance report submission timelines.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

G7.30 Expedited audits ▲

## G7.30.1 New information ▲

Examples of 'changes to the circumstances of the UoA and/or new information' that may require completion of an expedited audit include:

- · Major changes in management.
- · New information describing a major impact of the UoA.

However, as the FCP states, there must be good reason to think that these are actual material differences, and not a likely temporary change in indicated status; such a change might arise, for example, from the introduction of a new and not yet validated stock assessment model.

The MSC's intent is that if the CAB is uncertain whether changes to circumstances or new information will cause any of the triggers as defined in 7.30.1.a-c, the CAB should:

- · Take a precautionary approach.
- · Complete an Expedited Audit to assess the impact.

<!-- image -->

## G7.30.10 Expedited audits during full and initial assessment or scope extension ▲

The MSC's intent for expedited audits during full assessments is as follows:

- · Expedited audits are triggered at any point after the information cut-off date.
- · Expedited audits are conducted alongside the assessment process.
- · The determination and certificate decision are based on the information that was available up until the information cut-off date (7.15.1.1).
- · If the draft determination is to certify a UoA but the expedited audit results in the rescoring of an individual PI to less than 60 or a Principle score to less than 80, the determination and certificate decision is not affected (i.e. the certificate is issued). However, the result of the expedited audit means that the certificate is immediately suspended. The expedited audit report and the 'MSC Notice of Suspension Template' are published at the same time as the Public Certification Report.
- · The suspension is immediate, with no 30-day notice period.

<!-- image -->

## G7.30.12 Expedited audit during a reassessment ▲

If the reassessment is against a new version of the MSC Fisheries Standard, it is possible that an expedited audit is triggered for the existing certificate and not the reassessment, or vice versa, due to difference in Performance Indicator Scoring Guideposts.

When an expedited audit is triggered as per 7.30.1 for both the existing certificate and the reassessment, the MSC does not expect the CAB to conduct 2 separate expedited audits. Therefore, the CAB may:

- · Conduct the expedited audit activities so that all relevant information and Performance Indicator Scoring Guideposts are considered at the same time.
- · Publish a single expedited audit report.

However, if there are differences in the Performance Indicator Scoring Guideposts due to a new version of the MSC Fisheries Standard being used for the reassessment, the CAB will need to:

- · Record the results separately.
- · Clearly identify the results that are relevant to the existing certificate and the reassessment.

When an expedited audit is triggered for both the existing certificate and the reassessment, the expedited audit report is published within 60 days of announcing the expedited audit regardless of when the Public Certification Report is published. This allows the supply chain to prepare for the suspension of the UoC once the reassessment is finished.

## G7.31 Reassessment ▲

<!-- image -->

## G7.31.5.2 Open conditions at reassessment ▲

There are a number of scenarios under which a UoA could enter reassessment with an open condition(s):

- · The condition is being carried over into the next certificate (see G7.31.5.2.a).
- · The condition deadline is the 4th year surveillance audit and the 4th surveillance audit has not been conducted at the time of announcing the reassessment and publishing the Announcement Comment Draft Report.
- · The condition deadline is in the 5th year.

<!-- image -->

## G7.31.5.2.a Carrying over conditions ▲

Conditions can be carried over in the following scenarios:

- · Exceptional circumstances apply as per 7.16.6.
- · The condition was set during a surveillance audit during the most recent certificate cycle.
- · The condition was set during a scope extension assessment during the most recent certificate cycle.
- · The condition was set during an expedited audit during the most recent certificate cycle.
- · The condition was set on PI 1.2.1 scoring issue (a). The stock is at or above BMSY and 'available' harvest control rules (HCRs) are in place (MSC Fisheries Standard SA2.5.2-5).

<!-- image -->

## G7.31.6 Related conditions ▲

A related condition is a condition:

- · That was closed during the previous certification period, and
- · Where a new condition on the same Performance Indicator or Scoring Issue is set at the subsequent assessment or audit, or
- · Involves the same scoring element or topic (e.g. collecting information on P2 species).

The scenarios under which a related condition is opened could include:

- · A change in the assessment tree which has led to an increase in the performance required at the SG80 level (i.e. the sustainability bar has been raised).
- · There has been a change in status since the condition was closed; this would only be applicable for outcomes PIs.
- · The scoring element now falls under a different component (e.g. in the previous assessment a species was designated as a secondary species but is now designated as an ETP species).

<!-- image -->

## G7.31.13 Reduced reassessment ▲

Remote team members can provide support to the on-site team member. However, the CAB should determine how the team can best make use of on-site and remote team member(s) during the reduced reassessment.

The reduced reassessment may benefit from remote team member(s) participating in stakeholder consultations conducted at the site visit by the on-site team member. This should be considered and arranged as part of the planning process. There may be some stakeholder consultation meetings where it is not necessary for the remote team member(s) to participate remotely. If so, their time could be used more effectively for other reduced reassessment activities.

The team member selected to conduct the site visit (i.e. the on-site team member) should be the person most relevant to the content of the stakeholder interviews and information gathering that is needed to assess the UoA. For example, if the UoA had conditions on Principle 2 components, then the Principle 2 expert should be the on-site team member. The Team Leader will provide oversight of the reduced reassessment process.

## G7.32 Assessing Units of Certification that expire after the transition deadline against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0▲

## Background

These requirements allow for CABs to assess existing UoCs, as requested by the fishery client, against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 before the transition deadline of 26 October 2028.

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process v2.3

## G7.32.1.a Transition assessments▲

It is provided as an alternative assessment option for fishery clients in cases where completing their current certificate cycle against the MSC Fisheries Standard v3.0 is requested or required - see CAB Briefing Document.

## Annex GPB Harmonisation of overlapping UoAs - Guidance

<!-- image -->

## GPB1 Background ▲

The general principle in Annex PB is that any new assessment or audit within a harmonised group of overlapping fisheries should take into consideration the conclusions of any previous assessment or audit such that harmonisation is maintained over time.

When undergoing harmonisation efforts, clients should be encouraged to collaborate where possible (e.g. via certificate sharing), thereby minimising the number of overlapping assessments that require harmonisation. The MSC accepts that this is sometimes not possible, and that the uncertainties associated with harmonisation can sometimes be difficult for CABs and clients to plan for and manage.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.2.1 Overlapping UoAs ▲

CABs may use the MSC's Harmonisation Database to identify overlapping UoAs.

Harmonisation is not necessary in assessments of UoAs that use similar gears or management approaches but operate in clearly different geographical areas.

## GPB1.2.3 Reporting overlapping UoAs▲

These clauses are to ensure there is full transparency over what will need to be harmonised, whether that involves adopting previous scores or whether there is a need to re-open harmonisation discussions due to PB1.4.1.1 being triggered.

## GPB1.3.1 Harmonised assessment outcomes ▲

In cases where there are 2 UoCs from the same UoA, harmonisation should be expected to result in identical scores and conditions unless there is a very clear explanation of the different practices adopted by the 2 UoCs that justifies their different scores.

The MSC's intent is that a part of a UoA that simply decides for commercial or other reasons to have a separate certificate should not be allowed to have different scoring from other members of the same fleet. The MSC seeks to avoid a situation, particularly in Principle 2, in which a UoA in receipt of conditions is able to split itself into several small fisheries and avoid conditions or avoid the requirements to deal with cumulative Principle 2 issues, simply because the impacts of the UoAs are much smaller.

## GPB1.3.1.a Consistent scoring and rationales ▲

The MSC's intent is that overlapping UoAs have the same level of performance (i.e. the overall result of the relevant PI scoring is either a pass or a fail for overlapping fisheries).

Teams are not required to draft a single harmonised rationale for each relevant PI; scoring rationales may be drafted independently by each team. The rationales presented should, however, lead logically to the harmonised scores that are agreed between the teams (i.e. which scoring issue is met at each SG level and for each scoring element). The teams should use largely similar arguments and logic for the harmonised scoring rationales.

Having consistent outcomes does not mean the scores need to be exactly the same between different teams, so long as any conditions are generated by the same scoring issues and scoring elements within harmonised PIs, and the same outcome (pass/fail) is achieved. Given this constraint, and the rules applied in scoring (Section 7.15), it should be rare to find a situation where the scores are not exactly the same (an example would be where P2 species are only partly overlapping such that some species are harmonised, while others are not, such that the overall scores for the PIs may then differ).

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.3.1.b Consistent conditions and milestones ▲

The MSC's intent is that conditions are set on the same PIs, relating to the same scoring issues and scoring elements, as appropriate. There may be occasions when different conditions are justified, but they will be rare, and based only on 3 aspects:

- 1. Differences in requirements from different versions of the default trees.
- 2. Changes to management or status that have occurred since the original assessment.
- 3. Differences in actual performance of the fisheries.

Teams should consider the certificate lengths of overlapping UoAs. Teams should be precautionary such that the earliest date for closing a particular condition in 1 (or more) of the overlapping fisheries should apply to all overlapping UoAs.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.3.2 Exceptional circumstances ▲

An example of an exceptional circumstance in the context of harmonisation relates to P1 when there are 2 countries that share a stock but their methods of monitoring UoA removals are different, causing a demonstrable difference in the fisheries with regards to the scoring and rationales for PI 1.2.3 scoring issue (b).

Exceptional circumstances also apply where ETP species are nationally listed in one country but not another, as per PB1.3.1.1.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.4 Annual harmonisation ▲

The MSC's intent is that harmonisation of assessments of overlapping UoAs takes place once a year and the harmonised assessment outcomes are subsequently applied to all UoAs, regardless of whether they are subject to initial assessment, reassessment, scope extension assessment, transition assessment or surveillance audit. The CABs of the UoAs subject to harmonisation should collectively and collaboratively determine the timing of annual harmonisation activities and organise harmonisation activities accordingly. CABs should consider the timing of management advice and surveillance audit schedules when organising annual harmonisation activities.

## Example

Management advice for stock A is released in April every year. There are 4 UoAs which include stock A as the P1 target stock. The surveillance audits for the 4 UoAs are scheduled to take place between July and October. The CABs may decide to hold the harmonisation activities in May, once the stock management advice has been released. The CABs may decide to bring forward the surveillance audits (as per FCP 7.29.8.1) so that the harmonisation activities take place during the surveillance audit and the harmonised assessment outcomes can be incorporated into the Surveillance Reports immediately. Alternatively, the CABs may decide to announce the surveillance audits soon after the harmonisation activities have concluded so that the harmonised assessment outcomes can be incorporated into the Surveillance Reports as soon as possible.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.4.1.1 New information ▲

The MSC's intent is that harmonisation is not triggered by teams who have a difference in opinion based on the same information.

<!-- image -->

## GPB1.5.1 Discussion of overlapping UoAs by teams ▲

Under PB1.5.1, nothing precludes the harmonisation discussion from being mediated. It is expected that at the end of the harmonisation discussion, teams will have harmonised assessment outcomes.

## GPB1.5.1.b-c Harmonisation of scores and conditions when evaluating cumulative impacts of MSC UoAs in PI 2.1.1 and PI 2.2.1 and PI 2.4.2 ▲

In 2014, the MSC introduced a number of requirements for assessing the cumulative impacts of certified fisheries.

When 2 or more UoAs enter assessment at the same time, the regular rules of harmonisation apply and outcomes and conditions need to be accounted for in terms of cumulative impacts and elsewhere.

When an under-assessment UoA overlaps with a certified fishery, the team should consider the cumulative impact of all MSC UoAs during the assessment process of that UoA, if the UoA and the certified fisheries all meet the trigger requirement for cumulative impacts (e.g. they all classify primary species A as 'main').

Certified fisheries do not need to consider the cumulative impact of any newly certified UoA until the first surveillance audit following the certification of the additional UoA.

When taking into account the cumulative impacts of several MSC UoAs, it could be the case that a currently certified fishery would have its Principle 2 scores changed if a newly certified fishery increases the cumulative impact on a depleted stock.

Cumulative impacts for vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) habitats are dealt with under management requirements and the MSC expects that cumulative precautionary avoidance of impact should be implemented rapidly. For instance, it could be the case that a newly certified fishery has designated and closed new VMEs. These VMEs should also be considered by the already certified fishery at its next surveillance audit.

The terms of an existing condition for currently certified fisheries might also change with the arrival of newly certified fisheries triggering the cumulative impact requirements, particularly for VMEs. This would likely be the case when the cumulative impact has increased and when differing partial strategies have not aligned. In such cases, the harmonisation of milestones to achieve a demonstrably effective strategy at SG80 (for PI 2.1.1) or to provide evidence that VMEs are being protected by all MSC UoAs at SG80 (for PI 2.4.2) might then also be altered.

In this case, teams should allow increased flexibility in terms of setting the milestones of the harmonised condition, thereby ensuring that already certified fisheries working on achieving their milestones would not fail to meet them during the certificate lifetime due to the arrival of the newly certified fisheries and the higher impact.

## GPC1.2-4 Fishery team qualifications ▲

The qualification requirements for fishery team leaders, members and the team overall (Tables PC1, PC2 and PC3) each require at least 3 years' experience in different aspects of fisheries science and management. Experience that may be counted towards the 3-year requirement includes:

- · Experience working on MSC assessments (e.g. as part of a team on a previous fishery assessment).
- · Relevant research experience, including that gained during higher-level research degrees (e.g. a PhD or a Masters by thesis); however, the CAB should not include lower-level research (e.g. during a Masters by coursework with a short summer project) or undergraduate training.

The CAB should note the additional ISO19011 training requirements for team leaders in the personnel requirements of the GCR.

Where 3 years' or more experience is stated, the '3 years' refers to an individual team member needing to have 3 years' experience. The experience cannot be the accumulated experience of different team members (e.g. 1+2 years).

## 2 Fish stock biology/ecology ▲

<!-- image -->

For a team member to comply with this requirement, 'similar biology' in this context means that where the target species is:

- · A demersal fish species, experience with other demersal fish species qualifies.
- · A pelagic fish species, experience with other pelagic fish species qualifies.
- · A crustacean species, experience with other crustacean species qualifies.
- · A mollusc species, experience with other mollusc species qualifies.
- · Similarly, for any other taxon.

<!-- image -->

## 5 Current knowledge of the country, language and local fishery context ▲

'Common language' means knowledge of a language that is spoken by clients and stakeholders. The intent of the requirement is to ensure that information can be clearly exchanged between the team, client and stakeholders, and understood by most parties. For example, the common language in Indonesia could be Bahasa, and in African countries it could be English, French or Portuguese.

A 'relevant fishery' in this context means where the scale of the fishery, the stock assessment techniques and management approaches are similar to those in the fishery under assessment. For example, if the fishery under assessment is a small-scale operation with limited quantitative information and informal management systems, then relevant fisheries would have these characteristics as well. Similarly, if the fishery under assessment is large scale or industrial with fully quantitative stock assessment approaches and related management systems (such as harvest control rules related to input/output measures) then relevant fisheries would also have these characteristics.

Annex PD outlines the minimum assessment requirements necessary for a scope extension from an already certified fishery to another fishery. There may be cases where additional assessment steps or evaluations are necessary to ensure that the entire assessment of the fishery across all 3 Principles continues to be accurate when additional stocks are added to Principle 1.

## GPD1.2.2.1.a Gap analysis ▲

The CAB may use Table G8 to describe the outcome of the gap analysis.

## GPD1.2.4.3.b Considerations for rescoring of Principle 2 species ▲

In cases where there are a number of stocks identified as main primary in a certified fishery, assessing 1 or more of these against Principle 1 instead will mean that they are removed as scoring elements from Principle 2 primary species.

The remaining scoring elements in Principle 2 primary species should then be rescored according to 7.15.10.d. This does not require a Principle 2 expert.

If the new Principle 2 score causes a failure of the UoA due to the reallocation of Principle 2 species to Principle 1, the CAB may choose to discontinue the scope extension process for 1 or more stocks.

## Introduction to the Risk-Based Framework (RBF)

<!-- image -->

## ▲

The FAO Guidelines on Ecolabelling for Fisheries and Fisheries Products from Marine Capture Fisheries provided the conceptual basis for the adoption of a risk-based approach to the evaluation of fisheries against certain PIs in circumstances where information is inadequate to evaluate those PIs conventionally.

In paragraph 32, the FAO guidelines state:

- '…the use of less elaborate methods for assessment of stocks should not preclude fisheries from possible certification for ecolabelling'. It goes on to note '...to the extent that the application of such methods results in greater uncertainty about the state of the 'stock under consideration', more precautionary approaches to managing such resources will be required which may necessitate lower levels of utilisation of the resource'.

The inference is that in the absence of detailed scientific information on fishery impacts and providing the existence of tools that provide a qualitative or semi-quantitative indication of the risk inherent in a fishery, it should be possible to assess such a fishery for certification based on the extent to which fishing activity is demonstrably 'precautionary' or of 'less risk'.

The MSC adopted an approach that considers a combination of risk-based indicators to arrive at a risk score that translates to a parallel MSC score. The risk-based indicators used in this process include qualitative and semi-quantitative proxies that assess the impact of fishing activity or correspond with the level of utilisation of the resource. In addition, the approach requires the team to adopt the worst-case scenario approach to scoring the risk indicators in the absence of credible evidence, information or logical reasoning to the contrary.

In the event of the RBF being used for a PI, the likelihood of being scored high risk and of receiving a low MSC scores on the specified indicator increases with increasing scale and intensity of utilisation of resources in the fishery. While the RBF allows the use of more qualitative information obtained under an extensive stakeholder consultation process, increased uncertainty around the information or evidence used, or the lack of consensus on information obtained in the process will result in the most cautious (worst plausible) score being applied, furthering the likelihood of lower MSC scores.

The MSC's intention in allowing the use of a risk-based approach is to ensure that its assessment process is accessible to data-deficient fisheries that are readily demonstrated as operating in a precautionary manner.

Implicit in the approach is a recognition that fisheries operating at relatively high levels of utilisation pose a greater risk to the ecological components with which they interact and that the assessment and management of such risks must be underpinned by comprehensive scientific information.

The MSC is aware of the existence of other risk-based analysis tools, as well as the fact that the development of these tools is a continuous process. The MSC has not calibrated any alternative riskbased approaches against the default assessment tree but would encourage interested parties to consider calibration of such equivalent risk-based approaches against the SGs in the default assessment tree. Future versions of the MSC RBF will reflect the continuing evolution and refinement of these tools and methods.

The precaution built into the RBF methods creates an incentive to use the conventional process when data is available. Precautionary levels can be defined as the probability that the resulting RBF score is greater than the score obtained if using the default assessment tree (DAT). RBF parameters have been calibrated so that when scoring data-deficient scoring elements it is expected that:

- · For PI 1.1.1, the probability that the RBF score is greater than the DAT is &lt;0.01.
- · For PI 2.1.1, the probability that the RBF score is greater than the DAT is &lt;0.05.
- · For PI 2.2.1, the probability that the RBF score is greater than the DAT is &lt;0.2, or resulting scores are on average less than 10 scoring points above PI 2.1.1.

- · For PI 2.3.1, the probability that the RBF score is greater than the DAT is &lt;0.05.
- · For PI 2.4.1, the probability that the RBF score is greater than the DAT is &lt;0.5.
- · For PI 2.5.1, the precautionary level of the RBF has not been calculated.

## GPF1.1 Applying the RBF in scoring different PIs ▲

## Background

The RBF is designed for use in association with the default tree for Principles 1 and 2. The RBF was adopted by the MSC to enable scoring of fisheries in data-deficient situations, particularly for the outcome PIs associated with Principles 1 and 2.

The RBF may be applied to the whole PI if all scoring elements are determined to be data-deficient. However, there may be occasions where quantitative information is available for some scoring elements within outcome PIs (i.e. species under PI 2.1.1) and not others. In such cases, the decision on the use of the RBF should be taken at a scoring element level.

For Principle 1 PIs, there is typically only 1 scoring element being considered (target species of the UoA), but under Principle 2, the full range of primary and secondary species, habitats, or ecosystems could be assessed.

There can be cases where there are both data-deficient and non-data-deficient scoring elements (e.g. different primary species).

<!-- image -->

## GPF1.1.1 RBF methodologies ▲

The RBF includes a set of methods for assessing the risk to each of the ecological components from activities associated with the UoA in assessment. The methods range in complexity and data requirements from a system based on expert judgment, to a semi-quantitative analysis to assess potential risk. Each of the methods provides a risk-based estimate of the impact of the UoA on a datadeficient scoring element being scored within outcome PI. These risk estimates are in turn related to the specific Scoring Guideposts used to assess the performance of the UoA against the PI for a component.

To achieve a good result, it is necessary to plan the stakeholder consultation strategy for each of the methodologies in such a way as to ensure effective participation from a range of stakeholders.

The robustness of these methodologies relies heavily on the inputs of a suitably broad stakeholder group with a good balance of knowledge about the UoA and the ecological components on which it has impacts. Table GPF1 below provides a description of the 4 methodologies within the RBF.

Table GPF1: Description of methodologies within the RBF

| Methodology                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Consequence  Analysis (CA)                    | The CA is a semi-quantitative analysis that assesses the consequence of  fishing activity on a particular species subcomponent. The CA is partly based  on the structured collection of qualitative information from a diverse group of  stakeholders, as well as using information on proxies that can be used to  estimate changes to the relevant subcomponent in a UoA.                                         |
| Productivity  Susceptibility  Analysis (PSA)  | The PSA requires information about the productivity and susceptibility of each  species in a given PI, and uses this information to individually score a set of  attributes using pre-established PSA tables. Any attribute for which there is  insufficient data is automatically assigned the highest risk score: at least  some of information is thus needed to demonstrate low risk in the UoA.                |
| Consequence  Spatial Analysis  (CSA)          | The CSA requires information about the consequence of fishing activities and  spatial distribution of habitat types and uses this information to individually  score a set of attributes using pre-established CSA tables. Any attribute for  which there is insufficient data is automatically assigned the highest risk  score: at least some level of information is needed to demonstrate low risk in  the UoA. |
| Scale Intensity  Consequence  Analysis (SICA) | The SICA is a qualitative analysis that aims to identify which activities lead to  a significant impact on any ecosystem. A SICA is partly based on the  structured collection of qualitative information pertaining to the PI in question  from a diverse group of stakeholders.                                                                                                                                   |

| 2.4.3 | Habitats  information           | RBF not applicable, but there are RBF specific scoring issues, which  have to be scored. These additional scoring issues has been included  since the information required to meet default scoring issues would not  be expected to be available in data-limited situations applicable to the  RBF. If the RBF is used to score PI 2.4.1 it is recognised that the  information is not sufficient to identify habitats encountered by the UoA  or to determine the impact of the UoA on habitats encountered. For this  reason, alternative scoring issues, (a) and (b) are scored instead of the  default assessment tree scoring issue (a) and (b). |

## GPF2 Stakeholder involvement in RBF

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.1 Announcing the RBF ▲

If the team decide to trigger the RBF for a scoring element after the fishery assessment is announced (7.10), this will require additional communication to stakeholders prior to the site visit. If it is not clear whether a scoring element meets criteria in Table 3, the CAB should announce the possibility of using the RBF at the fishery announcement stage (7.10). In this case, and to improve efficiency of the assessment process, the CAB should announce use of the RBF at fishery announcement and plan the site visit as if it were an RBF assessment as set out in the FCP. If information is found at the site visit that indicates the RBF is not necessary, the UoA may proceed with a non-RBF assessment for this scoring element.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.2 Information gathering ▲

The team should use existing data and reports, if available, to identify target species, primary species, secondary species, habitats and ecosystems that may be impacted by the UoA.

The team may use expert judgement and anecdotal evidence to compile preliminary lists of information. The team should then consult with stakeholders, either individually or at fishery management meetings, on the preliminary list. The team should document and justify any additions to or deletions from the preliminary list of information.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.2.1.a Management arrangements ▲

For example, information of management arrangements, such as quotas, limited entry, gear restrictions, spatial closures, depth limits, etc.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.2.1.f Information about UoA/habitats ▲

If there is limited information available about habitat(s) encountered by the UoA, the team may use local knowledge and/or participatory methods to define the habitat(s).

## Example

For example, if there is no detailed understanding of a habitat's substratum, geomorphology, and (characteristic) biota (SGB), the team may use other sources of local information, such as data collected by local dive operators, to support the determination of habitats. Furthermore, the team may conduct RBF stakeholder workshops to determine, for example, biome classification or depth ranges of habitats using participatory methods to gather stakeholder knowledge.

## GPF2.3 Stakeholder consultation

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.3.2 Text to inform stakeholders ▲

The MSC's intent for the recommended text is to encourage a broad range of stakeholders to attend site visits and to provide some advance notice on the nature of the RBF approach.

## GPF2.3.3 Planning ▲

The team should plan the stakeholder engagement process prior to the site visit to ensure effective participation of stakeholders. The team should conduct background to ensure that time with stakeholders is focussed on new issues that are raised by stakeholders.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.3.3.1 Stakeholders ▲

Stakeholder consultation with a suitably broad stakeholder group with a good balance of knowledge about the fishery is critical in a risk assessment, particularly at the qualitative (CA/SICA) level of an assessment. Stakeholders provide expert judgement, local knowledge, hands-on experience, fisheryspecific and ecological knowledge and raise issues that may not be covered in material provided to the team.

The team should ensure the stakeholder group includes at least fishers, scientists, conservationists, indigenous representatives, managers, local residents, fish processors and others as necessary.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.3.3.2 Effective consultation ▲

Early identification of stakeholders is vital to ensuring effective consultation during the assessment process. The team should identify stakeholders both through contacts made available by the fishery client and via active stakeholder engagement methods. The choice of which method(s) to use depends on the circumstance of the UoA.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.3.3.3 Location ▲

The location of the meetings is very important to ensure good participation of stakeholders. The team should consider the following when deciding the location of meetings:

- · If stakeholders are spread over a wide area, it might be necessary to hold more than 1 set of meetings to allow for participation.

- · The choice of venue needs to be considered depending on the number of stakeholders attending the meetings and the space needed for engagement.
- · Meetings can be both formal and informal.
- · Engagement can be effective in any location whether inside or outside as long as the team is prepared to run the workshop in that setting.

## GPF2.3.3.4 Meetings ▲

<!-- image -->

The team may organise stakeholder meetings using a number of approaches: workshops, focus groups, separate meetings or a blended approach. The team should consider the following factors when deciding the format and structure of meetings:

- · The number of PIs that are being assessed using the RBF. It might be better to hold a separate RBF workshop with those who have information relevant to the PIs with other stakeholders attending a different meeting(s).
- · Stakeholder dynamics within the group, which will affect who should meet together and who should meet separately.
- · There may be conflicting opinions among group members. It might be useful to allow these opinions to be shared to help the team draw conclusions from the stakeholders.

<!-- image -->

## GPF2.3.3.7 Background information ▲

The objective of providing materials and background information is to ensure that stakeholders can be brought up to the same level of understanding ahead of the meeting.

## GPF3

## Conducting a Consequence Analysis (CA)

GPF3.1

Preparation

## GPF3.1.1 ▲

The team may do this by defining each species as a separate UoA or by scoring the species as separate scoring elements within a combined UoA.

## GPF3.1.3 CA scoring template ▲

Table GPF3 shows an example of how to complete a CA template.

## GPF3.3.2 Examples of indicator (proxy) data to score consequence ▲

Table GPF4 provides some examples of indicator (proxy) trend data that the team may use to score consequence.

The list is not exhaustive but seeks to give an indication of the types of indicator data needed to score the subcomponents.

The team may support the interpretation of indicator and trend data with other information known about the UoA and the expert judgment of the team.

Table GPF4: Examples of indicator (proxy) data to score consequence

| Subcomponent           | Indicator/Proxies                                                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Population size        | Catch, effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE)  time-series.  Sex ratio in male-only fisheries. |
| Reproductive capacity  | Size class indexes.                                                                             |
| Age/Size/Sex structure | Catch length/age index or time-series.  Catch composition (sex ratio) time-series.              |
| Geographic range       | Time-series species distribution.                                                               |

Where judgements about risk are uncertain, the team should score the consequence category with the lowest score (highest risk) that is still regarded as plausible.

In the application of the Consequence Analysis, the team should determine the risk that the UoA poses on stock status without the use of reference points. Measures and trends of fishing effort, landings, exploitation rates, biomass and recruitment estimates and spawning events before recruiting to the fishery are examples of indicators that the team may use to determine the risk associated with the fishing activity. The Consequence Analysis is intended to be a measure of the risk that fishing activity poses to long-term recruitment dynamics.

UoAs operating at full exploitation levels (the so-called large-scale fisheries) will likely score below 80. The team should only score above 60 if available indicators provide evidence of recruitment not being adversely damaged. The team may score higher if the UoA  is operating at low exploitation levels in relation to the size of the stock and biology of the species. The team should only score a higher CA score, of up to 100, if the impact of the fishing activity cannot be differentiated from the natural variability for this population.

The team should score 80 if available information shows changes in the population subcomponent that can be reasonably attributable to the fishing activity, but these are of such a low magnitude that the impact of the UoA is considered to be minimal on the population size and dynamics.

The team should score 60 if available information shows changes to the population subcomponent attributed to the fishing activity and these changes are of such magnitude that they cannot be considered as minimal.

Examples of consequence score rationales for each subcomponent are shown below:

| A slow-growing, long-lived species (more than 40 years of age). The estimated age  at 50% selectivity (22 years) is well above the age at 50% maturity (5.3 years).  Individuals should therefore have more than 17 years of spawning before they  enter the fishery, therefore ensuring the protection of a significant part of the adult  population (survival of discards is assumed to be high). It can be concluded that  the fishery has minimal impact on population size and no impact on dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                               |          80 |
| The moderate to low exploitation rates, together with minimum landing size (MLS)  that allows multiple spawning events indicates that the fishery has minimal impact  on population dynamics. The status of the stock of crab in the area, informed by  stock indicators on biomass and fishing mortality, is considered good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |          80 |
| The cockle stock is intensively fished (33% of the estimated biomass). Available  evidence suggests that there may be a detectable change in reproductive capacity  as cockles are caught in their second year of growth. The MLS implemented for  this fishery allows for catching individuals in their second year of growth. A retained  cockle is defined as one that is retained by a gauge having a square opening of 20  mm measured across each side. Cockles of this length are in their second year of  growth and will have spawned at least once before being caught. The harvest  strategy ensures that long-term recruitment dynamics is not adversely damaged by  fishing. |          60 |

| Size frequency distribution of the species is available from a fully developed  fishery, showing that recruitment is not being adversely damaged. However, the  level of catch and the fleet structure do not enable a qualitative assessment to  determine that the impact on population dynamics is minimal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          60 |
| In a crab fishery, available evidence indicates that there is a detectable change in  size/sex structure. However, information on abundance and recruitment indicates  that long-term recruitment dynamics have not been adversely damaged. There  appears to be a reduced number of large males of sufficient size to mate with the  largest females, and that has the potential effect of reducing the reproductive  capacity of these largest females. There is concern that reduced abundance of  large male crabs may lead to sperm limitation and reduced levels of egg |          60 |

Since the fishery  began in 1989, it has been calculated that 1,132km 2  have been swept by the gear,  with most of that in the period 1990-1998. This represents only 2% of the known  stock distribution area (i.e. surveyed area). During the last 5 years, fishing effort  has been very low with an average annual swept area of only about 26km 2 , and | 80    |

## GPF4.1.5.1.a Example of grouping by species ▲

The team should determine the taxonomic level at which species may be grouped based on the Principle 2 species characteristics. The team should not group higher than the family taxonomic level.

Table GPF5 below represents a list of Principle 2 species in a fictional UoA. Before the site visit, the team determined that there is 1 group (with 15 species) and 8 separate species needing to be scored using the RBF for PI 2.1.1.

## GPF4.1.5.1.b Scoring groups ▲

The team may identify the same species that is the most vulnerable according to a high-risk productivity score and through a qualitative process with stakeholders.

The team may score productivity attributes ahead of the stakeholder meetings using information sources such as FishBase (fishbase.org).

The team should determine which species is most at risk qualitatively based on knowledge of inherent species vulnerability, as well as frequency of interaction with the fishery, and level of damage done (e.g. released alive vs. always killed).

## GPF4.1.5.1.c Scoring 2 species ▲

The team may score more than 2 species as appropriate.

## GPF4.1.5.5 Determining PSA - MSC score for species groups ▲

The RBF worksheet in Table GPF6 shows the results of the above-mentioned example.

The RBF worksheet automatically combines multiple scoring elements using the rules in Table PF7. If there are multiple scoring elements, the team should either use the results from the RBF worksheet or look at the rules in Table PF7.

Table GPF6: Example of scoring most at-risk species

| Species     | Representative species                  | PSA   | MSC   | Number of   | Final group   |

## MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Certification Process v2.3

Table GPF7: Scoring elements and grouping species into the RBF worksheet

<!-- image -->

## GPF4.1.5.6 ▲

Species grouping is optional, but it also implies that the score will be capped at 80. In order to achieve a score of above 80, the team should assess all of the species using the PSA.

<!-- image -->

## GPF4.3 PSA Step 1: Score the productivity attributes ▲

The level of fishing impact a species can sustain depends on the inherent productivity of the species. The productivity determines how rapidly a species can recover from depletion or impact due to fishing. The productivity of a species is determined by species attributes such as longevity, growth rate, fecundity, recruitment and natural mortality. Information about productivity attributes can be found in scientific literature and websites like FishBase (fishbase.org).

## GPF4.3.1 ▲

The team should review various sources of information to determine correct productivity characteristics for scoring elements being assessed under the PSA.

## Guidance to Table PF4

<!-- image -->

## Productivity attributes and scores - density dependence ▲

Depensatory effects (Allee effects) can arise from the reduced probability of fertilisation, and the team should therefore take them into account when scoring species productivity.

Depensatory effects may have a profound effect on the resilience of marine invertebrates to fishing mortality, as shown in some crabs and lobsters, and often also sedentary bivalves.

The team should score the density-dependent attribute as 3 (high risk, low productivity) if the species slow down the rate of population growth at low densities (depensatory dynamics). The team may score the density-dependent attribute as 1 (low risk, high productivity) if species show compensatory dynamics at low densities because density dependence acts to stabilise the populations.

<!-- image -->

## GPF4.4 PSA Step 2: Score the susceptibility attributes ▲

The level of fishing impact that a scoring species can sustain depends on its vulnerability or susceptibility to capture or damage by the fishery activities. The susceptibility of a species is determined by attributes such as the degree of overlap between the distribution of the fishery and the distribution of the species; and whether the species occurs at the same depth in the water column as the fishing gear.

Susceptibility is estimated as the product of 4 independent aspects; Areal overlap (availability), encounterability, selectivity and post-capture mortality (PCM).

## GPF4.4.3.a ▲

In the 'MSC RBF worksheet' the team should manually input data on catch per gear/fishery affecting the stock (for PI 1.1.1 column W, for PI 2.1.1 and PI 2.2.1, column Y).

<!-- image -->

## GPF4.4.3.d and e Catch percentages ▲

Where catch percentages are unknown or too uncertain to make a determination on which species are 'main' see MSC Guidance to the Fisheries Standard.

## GPF4.4.4.1.a ▲

This could be tonnage of total catch for each of the fisheries being considered.

## GPF4.4.5 ▲

## Example

Catch data indicates that the UoA (longline fishery) catches approximately 1000t of the target species Atlantic cod. The catch data of the gillnet fishery that also retains Atlantic cod from the same stock cannot be estimated. During the RBF stakeholder workshop stakeholders agreed that the longline catch of 1000t comprises approximately 40% of the total catch while the gillnet fishery contributes about 10% of total catch. The weighting score for the longline fishery will be 2 and the weighting score for the gillnet fishery will be 1.

## GPF4.4.6 ▲

The areal overlap is the sum of the total percentage overlap of all fishery activity with the areal concentration of a stock. For example, if there are 2 fisheries both affecting 20% of the distribution of the species, the result would be 40% overlap, and a high-risk score awarded.

## Example: Areal overlap

A demersal species has a wide stock distribution. However, due to its preferred habitat, the species is found in the area shaded in grey for 95% of the time. Such behavioural patterns reduce the overlap between the species and the fishing activity (from 40% to ~20%) of fishery A and B (if considering the susceptibility cumulatively and this should be considered in scoring) (Figure GPF1). If the species in the example showed migratory behaviour the situation would be different.

Figure GPF1: Scoring areal overlap

<!-- image -->

This introduces appropriate precaution in the case where neither qualitative nor quantitative data is available.

Where a fishery overlaps a large proportion of a stock distribution range the risk is high because the species has no refuge, and the potential for impact is high.

## GPF4.4.6.d ▲

The team should consider and document any uneven distribution or concentration of the stock into account, including consideration of core and marginal ranges when estimating areal overlap.

## Example

For example, for species that are known to school, and when the gear interacts with the schools, a high-risk score should be awarded for this attribute.

<!-- image -->

## GPF4.4.6.g.i Key LTL species and areal overlap ▲

The team should score fisheries that are estimated to operate at full exploitation rates or maximum sustainable levels (as defined in PF3.3.4.1) as high risk for areal overlap (&gt; 30%) due to the schooling behaviour of LTL species which increases the catchability of the gear.

## GPF4.4.7 ▲

The team should interpret low, medium and high risk based on the likelihood of a gear encountering a species.

If a fishery overlaps a large proportion of a stock distribution range, the team should consider the risk as high because the species has no refuge, and the potential for impact is high. Table GPF8 below shows an example of how to score encounterability.

The team should score encounterability as the sum of the depth range of gear types, so if 2 gear types are deployed at depth ranges where more than 30% of the concentration of a species are likely to occur, this should be scored as high risk.

Each fishery will have the same encounterability score as it is an aggregate of all gear types affecting the stock. It is assumed that encounterability would be scored as high-risk for a targeted species.

For pelagic gears the team should take a percentage overlap approach to determine the encounterability of the scoring element. For demersal gears, particularly static ones set on the seabed, the team should consider the likelihood of encounter of the scoring element on the seabed rather than the percentage overlap of the gear (on the slope) and concentration of the species.  The team should consider gears set on the seabed such as pots and bottom gillnets to have high encounterability for their target species. The overlap of the spatial distributions of the scoring element and the gear may be affected by the depth and slope, but the team should consider this under areal overlap rather than encounterability.

## Table GPF8: Example of scoring encounterability

| Pelagic species has a total depth range of 0-100m, and the depth range  of the gear is 0-10m.

See Figure GPF2.              | High                      |
| The species is known to migrate diurnally, and the gear interacts with a  high concentration of the species at a particular time of the day.                                                                                                                                        | High                      |

| If a pot fishery uses attractive bait, the chance of encounter for lobsters is  high.                                                                                                                                                                                               | High                      |
| A species occurring principally near the bottom will have low  encounterability from a gear fishing in mid-water.                                                                                                                                                                   | Low                       |

## GPF4.4.8 ▲

Selectivity provides an estimate of retention by the fishing gear and is scored based on the risk that the gear operation retains individuals smaller than the size at maturity.

The team should base the assessment of risk on a review of empirical or analogous catch profile data or the team should consider and document the risk unlikely (or improbable) based on information for the species, fishing gear and operation of the UoA.

## GPF4.4.8.d ▲

The team should score the selectivity of the gear type considering its potential to retain immature fish. 2 elements have been defined in order to adequately assess the selectivity attribute.

When scoring the element (a), the team should determine the frequency of deployments in which immature fish are caught. The team should only consider the frequency and not the number or proportion of juveniles caught. For example:

- · If juveniles are caught in 70% of gear deployments, susceptibility score for element (a) is 3 (high susceptibility).
- · If juveniles are caught in 70% of gear deployments but the proportion of juveniles in each deployment is very low, susceptibility score is still 3 (high susceptibility).
- · If juveniles are caught in only 1% of gear deployments, but when it occurs the proportion of juveniles is very high (e.g. 80%), susceptibility score is still 1 (low susceptibility).

When scoring the element (b) the team should focus on determining the potential of the gear/fishing method to retain juveniles or, in other words the ability of the juveniles to escape or avoid that particular gear.

## GPF4.4.9.a ▲

In assessing the probability that if a species is captured it would be released in a condition that would permit subsequent survival, the team may consider for example: biological factors that may limit the potential of a species to be captured alive; handling practices of the fishery or fisheries being considered; the time taken to clear discards from the deck, etc.

If possible, the team should verify observer data in face-to-face observer meetings to make sure that the observer is qualified to identify the species concerned.

## GPF4.5 PSA Step 3: Determine the PSA score and equivalent MSC score

## GPF4.5.1 ▲

This is done automatically using the 'MSC RBF worksheet' for RBF assessments.

PSA score is automatically rounded to 2 decimal points and MSC score per scoring element is rounded to the nearest whole number.

## Calculation of Euclidean distance:

For each component unit (e.g. species) the attributes for productivity are scored [1 3] (high, medium, low productivity). These attribute scores are averaged to provide an overall productivity score in the interval [1 3]. Similarly, for each unit the attributes within the 4 aspects of susceptibility are also scored [1 3] (low, medium, and high susceptibility). These aspects are multiplied and rescaled to the interval [1 3] to provide a susceptibility score. These 2 scores are then plotted on the PSA diagnostic plot. A single risk score is calculated as the Euclidean distance from the nominal origin (0.5, 0.7), calculated as ) ( 2 2 S P R + = ; where R is the risk score, P is the productivity score, and S the susceptibility score. This single risk score allows a ranking of all units considered.

The divisions between risk categories and hence Scoring Guideposts are based on dividing the area of the PSA plots into equal thirds, as shown in Figure GPF3.

Figure GPF3: Examples of diagnostic charts for displaying PSA values for each species

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Left chart : Low-risk species have high productivity and low susceptibility, while high-risk species have low productivity and high susceptibility. The curved lines divide the potential risk scores into thirds on the basis of the Euclidean distance from the origin (0, 0).

Right chart : Example PSA plot for a set of target species. Note the curved lines that divide the risk space into equal thirds.

When assessing PIs 1.1.1, 2.1.1 and 2.3.1 using the RBF, the quadratic equation used for the PSA is:

MSC Score = -11.965(PSA)2 + 32.28(PSA) + 78.259

There is a direct quadratic relationship (R2=1) between overall PSA scores and MSC score equivalents. This has been derived by setting the lowest possible risk score (i.e. all attributes score low risk) as equivalent to an MSC score of 100 and setting the lower and upper bounds of the 'medium risk' range as equivalent to MSC scores of 60 and 80, respectively. A curve through these points is described by the conversion equation above.

However, when scoring data-deficient scoring elements in PI 2.2.1, a different quadratic equation is used in order to reflect the precautionary levels expected for this PI, as outlined in Section GPF1.

MSC Score = -5.8(PSA)2 + 6.9(PSA) + 105.0

## GPF5

## Scoring the UoA using the RBF for species Performance Indicators (PIs 1.1.1, 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1)

## GPF5.1.1.1 ▲

In the 'MSC RBF worksheet' the CA score can be manually inputted. This generates the MSC score for each PI 1.1.1 scoring element automatically using rules set out in Table PF7.

## GPF5.2.2 ▲

In the MSC RBF worksheet, where there are multiple scoring elements and they are all data-deficient the final PI score is automatically calculated in the 'automated scoring' tab.

## GPF5.3.1.1 ▲

The team should interpret the term 'additional information' as any other relevant information not specifically addressed in PF3.3 (determining the CA score), PF4.3 (scoring productivity attributes) or PF4.4 (scoring susceptibility attributes). The use of additional information does not exempt the team from the requirement of assessing all required information in the sections above. The team should assign the more precautionary score if the required information is limited.

Setting conditions using the RBF for species Performance Indicators (PIs 1.1.1, 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1)

## GPF6.1.2 ▲

The team may test whether the proposed Client Action Plan will have the desired effect at the time of accepting the Client Action Plan by re-running the PSA.

The team may use PSA results to assist with condition setting by identifying the set of productivity and susceptibility attributes that have contributed to a high risk score. The fishery client could include actions to reduce the risk, for example by implementing changes in the attributes identified as high risk (i.e. by reducing susceptibility).

Since productivity attributes are inherent to the species, these attributes cannot be changed through Client Action Plans. Where individual productivity attributes have been scored high risk because of lack of information, these risk scores could be reduced if additional studies were conducted and provided information that indicated a lower risk score. For example, if the risk score for a particular secondary species was due to high encounterability and high PCM, then the Client Action Plan may include actions to restrict fishing to night time or reduce the mortality when that species is captured. The team may test these actions by simulating changing the PSA attribute scores and observing whether the risk category changes.

The team should consider whether actions proposed in the Client Action Plan (e.g. alternative gear) could have negative consequences on other scoring elements.

## Example:

Fishery X assessed its target species using the RBF, because they had 5 years of CPUE data had not used the indicator to develop reference points. Target species scored 80 with the CA on population size (using CPUE data) and 80 with the PSA, an MSC score of 80 was assigned. Once MSC certified, the fishery implemented a detailed on-board logbook system which allowed detailed data on length/age and catch composition to be collected that was then used to develop reference points for the stock. At reassessment Fishery X had developed both outcome and trigger (empirical) reference points which allowed it to score PI 1.1.1 using the default assessment tree.

## GPF7

## Conducting the Consequence Spatial Analysis (CSA) ▲

## Background

The CSA was structured around a set of attributes that describe gear impacts (consequence) and the habitat (spatial) for each habitat being affected by different fishing gears. The CSA methodology and attributes were based on the 'Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing' methodology (Hobday et al., 2007 6 , Williams et al., 2011 7 ), which was derived from images, expert opinion, and scientific literature. Both the method and attributes were modified to enable their application to MSC assessments.

The CSA consists of the following steps:

- · CSA Step 1 : Define the habitat(s).
- · CSA Step 2 : Score the consequence attributes.
- · CSA Step 3 : Score the spatial attributes.
- · CSA Step 4 : Determine the CSA score and equivalent MSC score.

The CSA examines attributes of each habitat associated with the UoA in order to provide a relative measure of the risk on the scoring element (habitat) from fishing activities.

## GPF7.1 Preparation

## GPF7.1.4 ▲

Refer to MSC Fisheries Standard SA3.13.3, the subclauses, and the associated guidance for information about 'commonly encountered' habitats and VMEs.

## GPF7.1.6 ▲

In the absence of detailed scientific information, to the team should assess the UoA's impacts based on the extent to which fishing activity is demonstrably 'precautionary' or of 'less risk'. to the team should consider the worst-case scenario. For example, if fishing takes place on both the outer continental shelf and slope, the natural disturbance score should be 3 and not 2, reflecting the higher potential risk of impact on the slope. Another example is that the team should score removability of biota score should be 2 if a Danish seine UoA affects both low, robust biota and erect, medium biota.

The team should also consider UoA specifics in the absence of credible evidence, information, or logical reasoning to the contrary. For example, the addition of rockhoppers to trawl gear allows the UoA to contact previously inaccessible areas, which may contain more complex habitats. The team should consider the impacts on these more complex habitats when scoring the attributes. Conversely, some modifications may lessen the gear's impact on the habitat, which the team should also consider.

## GPF7.2 Stakeholder involvement within the CSA ▲

See Section PF2.3 for more information on stakeholder involvement within the RBF.

## GPF7.3 CSA Step 1: Define the habitat(s)

## GPF7.3.2 ▲

For example, 1 habitat may be defined as 'Medium-Outcrop-Large erect'.

## GPF7.3.3 ▲

The examples of biomes, sub-biomes, and features and their associated depths in Table PF9 are provided to emphasise the large differences that exist in the fauna and their life-history characteristics between depth zones and to provide a way to estimate the spatial extent of habitats (refer to the spatial overlap attribute below). For example, the extent of sediment plains on the outer shelf could be roughly estimated and differentiated from sediment plains on the slope.

## GPF7.4 CSA Step 2: Score the consequence attributes ▲

The 2 habitat-productivity attributes' scores are multiplied by 2 to reflect the increased importance of these 2 attributes. The consequence score is then the average of all habitat-productivity and gearhabitat interaction attribute scores.

## GPF7.4.1 ▲

Biotas have different intrinsic rates of growth, reproduction, and regeneration, which are also variable in different conditions of temperature, nutrients, and productivity (Williams et al., 2010 8 ). Habitat depth is an appropriate proxy for regeneration of biota because rates of growth and reproduction will typically be slower in deeper water where temperature and nutrient availability are lower (Hobday et

al., 2007). Further, the type of biota may be relevant since some (e.g. corals, crinoids, large sponges) grow at a very slow rate compared to others (e.g. encrusting species).

## GPF7.4.2.1 ▲

Biotas subject to greater natural disturbances have a greater intrinsic ability to recover from impacts. Common natural disturbances result from wave action and tidal movements, but other factors, such as local currents, storm surge, flooding, temperature fluctuations, and predation, may also be relevant. Habitat depth is considered a suitable proxy for natural disturbance because deeper habitats typically experience fewer or no natural disturbances.

## GPF7.4.4 ▲

Removability of biota is influenced by the size, height, robustness, flexibility, and structural complexity of the attached biota. Large, erect, inflexible, or delicate biota is more vulnerable to physical damage or removal than small, low, flexible, robust, or deep-burrowing biota. Rugosity refers to the ridged nature of the organism. In general, more rugose (i.e. complex) organisms are more vulnerable to the impacts of fishing. The interactions between a high diversity of biota types and non-standardised fishing gear can make this attribute difficult to score. For example, demersal trawls can have a range of factors influencing removability, such as footrope weight, use of chains, roller or bobbin size, bridle configuration, and door weight. The team should consider the full range of possible interactions.

## GPF7.4.5 ▲

For example, intermediate-sized rock fragments (6 cm to 3 m) that form attachment sites for sessile fauna can be permanently removed. While soft sediment is less resistant to impact, it is generally more resilient because it accumulates relatively rapidly and is altered by burrowing fauna.

## GPF7.4.6 ▲

The substratum hardness attribute considers whether or not the seabed will be degraded by contact with fishing gear. For example, hard rocky bottom is intrinsically more resistant to impact.

## GPF7.4.7 ▲

Substratum ruggedness is scored based on the concept that the access of gear to the habitat is related to the ruggedness of the substratum. For example, large rocks and steep slopes make an area less accessible to mobile gear.

## GPF7.4.8 ▲

For example, fishing impact can be greater on steep slopes because they are more prone to landslide damage.

## GPF7.5 CSA Step 3: Score the spatial attributes ▲

The spatial score is the geometric mean of the spatial attributes.

## GPF7.5.1 ▲

The team should consider the gear footprint in terms of gear size, weight, and mobility. This attribute measures the level of impact by considering the frequency and intensity of gear disturbance on the habitat. The gear footprint scores are based on the number of encounters needed to have an impact on structural biota in a unit area.

Table GPF9: Number of encounters needed to cause impact (modified from Williams et al., 2011)

| Gear type                                                               | Many encounters  needed to cause  impact   | Some encounters  needed to cause  impact   | Single encounter  needed to cause  impact   |

## GPF7.5.4 ▲

The spatial overlap attribute is the overlap of a habitat's range in the 'managed area' with the UoA's fishing area. It is calculated as the UoA's fishing area (Z) divided by the habitat's range within the 'managed area' (X) (Figure GPF4). Refer to GPF7.3.3 and Table PF9 for details on estimating the spatial extent of habitats.

Figure GPF4: Visualising the spatial overlap attribute

<!-- image -->

Spatial overlap (S) = proportion of X overlapped by Z

## GPF7.5.6 ▲

The encounterability attribute is a measure of how likely the UoA is to encounter the habitat within the 'managed area'.

## Example:

For example, a UoA using semi-pelagic gear that rarely affects a benthic habitat would likely have an encounterability score of 0.5 for that habitat. Similarly, a demersal trawl will have low encounterability with a habitat that is confined to heavy reef areas because the trawl cannot operate in such areas. Conversely, a UoA that uses a gear that targets a certain habitat will have high encounterability with that habitat.

## GPF7.5.4-7 Additional guidance on spatial overlap and encounterability ▲

The team should estimate the spatial overlap and encounterability attributes based on the most recent spatial distribution of fishing by the UoA. The team should modify the assessed fishing area of the UoA according to the gear being used.

For example, if longlines can be used only in part of the 'managed area' (e.g. due to habitat characteristics that do not allow for longline usage throughout the entire area), this part is what should be assessed here.

## GPF7.6 CSA Step 4: Determine the CSA score and equivalent MSC score ▲

## Calculation of Euclidean distance

For each scoring element (i.e. habitat), the attributes for consequence are scored 1-3 (low, medium, and high). Both of the habitat-productivity attributes' scores are doubled, and then all habitatproductivity and gear-habitat interaction attribute scores are averaged to provide an overall consequence score in the interval. Similarly, the spatial attributes are also scored 1-3 (low, medium, and high) though half scores are possible. The spatial score is derived as a geometric mean of the 3 spatial scores. The consequence and spatial scores then produce a single risk score calculated as the Euclidean distance from the nominal origin [0,0]: ) ( 2 2 S C R + = ;where R is the risk score, C is the consequence score, and S the spatial score.

## Conversion of the CSA score

The CSA score is converted to an MSC score using the quadratic equation:

MSC Score = -9.1(CSA)2 + 22.4(CSA) + 86.8

There is a direct quadratic relationship (R2=1) between overall CSA scores and MSC score equivalents. This has been derived setting the highest possible risk score (i.e. all attributes score high risk) as equivalent to an MSC score of 0; setting the lowest possible risk score (i.e. all attributes score low risk) as equivalent to an MSC score of 100; and setting the lower and upper bounds of the medium risk range as equivalent to MSC scores of 60 and 80, respectively.

## GPF7.6.4.1 ▲

Examples of information the team may not have previously considered within the CSA may, include gear footprint modifications that lessen the gear's impact by lessening the gear's size, weight, or mobility.

If MSC score adjustments are made, the team should base them on the attributes scored and on how the UoA varies from the scores provided within the scoring tables for each attribute. Examples of these score adjustments are as follows:

## Example:

- · The UoA is fishing with a Danish seine that has been modified to be lighter and have less bottom contact. The weight of the gear is relevant to the gear footprint attribute, and the lessened bottom contact could be relevant to the removability of biota, removability of substratum, and/or encounterability attributes; therefore, it is likely appropriate to increase the final MSC score.
- · A demersal trawl UoA with the addition of rockhoppers will have an increased impact (given the increased ability to access previously untrawlable areas) when compared to trawls without such additions. It would likely be appropriate to adjust the final MSC score downwards since this type of gear has increased impact on the removability of biota and removability of substratum attributes as well as increased spatial overlap and/or encounterability attribute scores.

## GPF7.7 Setting conditions using the CSA

## GPF7.7.1 ▲

Since some of the CSA attributes are inherent to the habitat (i.e. consequence attributes), these attributes are not likely to be changed through Client Action Plans. If attributes have been scored as 'high risk' because of a lack of information, these risk scores could be reduced if additional studies were conducted and provided information that indicated a lower risk score.

However, implementation of the Client Action Plan may lead to changes within the spatial attributes. For example, fishery clients can implement gear modifications that lessen their habitat impacts, fishery clients may change their spatial footprint by avoiding high-score scoring elements (e.g. corals), and/or fishery clients may make other spatial changes that will result in lower-risk impacts.

The team may elect to test whether the proposed Client Action Plan will have the desired effect at the time of accepting the Client Action Plan by re-running the CSA. The team should consider whether actions proposed in the Client Actin Plan (e.g. alternative gear) could have negative consequences on other scoring elements.

## Conducting a Scale Intensity Consequence

## GPF8 Analysis (SICA)

<!-- image -->

## GPF8.1 Preparation ▲

The 5 MSC SICA steps are summarised below:

- · SICA Step 1 : Prepare a SICA scoring template for each ecosystem.
- · SICA Step 2 : Score spatial scale of the fishing activity.
- · SICA Step 3 : Score temporal scale of the fishing activity.
- · SICA Step 4 : Score the intensity of the fishing activity.
- · SICA Step 5 : Score the consequence resulting from the scale and intensity of the fishing activity for the most vulnerable subcomponent of the ecosystem.

SICA Step 2: Score spatial scale of fishing activity potentially having

## GPF8.4 an impact on the ecosystem

## GPF8.4.2 ▲

The scale score is not used to mathematically determine the consequence score. It is used in the process of making judgements about the level of intensity at SICA Step 4. 2 different activities that scored the same for spatial scale might have quite different outcomes for the intensity score.

## Example of use of Table PF19:

If fishing activity (e.g. capture by longline) takes place within 20% of the overall distribution of the ecosystem, then the spatial scale is scored as 3. This needs to be the overlap of the fishing activity of the Unit of Assessment with the ecosystem distribution.

## GPF8.5 SICA Step 3: Score temporal scale of fishing activity potentially having an impact on the ecosystem

## GPF8.5.2 ▲

## Examples of scoring temporal scale:

- · If the fishing activity occurs daily, the temporal scale is scored as 6.
- · If fishing activity occurs once per year, then the temporal scale is scored as 3.
- · It may be more logical for some activities to consider the aggregate number of days that an activity occurs. For example, if the activity 'fishing' was undertaken by 10 boats during the same 150 days of the year, the score is 4. If the same 10 boats each spend 30 nonoverlapping days fishing, the temporal scale of the activity is a sum of 300 days, indicating that a score of 6 is appropriate.
- · In the case where the activity occurs over many days, but only every 10 years, the number of days divided by the number of years in the cycle is used to determine the score. For example, 100 days of an activity every 10 years averages 10 days every year, so a score of 3 is appropriate.

## GPF8.6 SICA Step 4: Score the intensity of the relevant activity

## GPF8.6.1 ▲

The team should ensure the intensity score is consistent with the spatial and temporal scores.

## Example of scoring intensity:

For example, if spatial and temporal scales are scored as high-risk, the same would be expected when scoring intensity. The overall intensity of fishing activity depends upon the distribution and dynamics of the stock being exploited.

## GPF8.6.1.2 ▲

The team should ensure that the intensity score reflects the frequency and extent of fishing activity.

Scale scores are not used to mathematically determine the consequence score, they are used in the process of making judgements about level of intensity. 2 different activities that scored the same for scale score might have quite different outcomes for the intensity score.

## Examples of intensity scores:

- · Spatial scale score = low, and temporal scale score = low.

Intensity score = low

Justification: The spatial overlap between the fishing activity and the ecosystem distribution is extremely low and the fishing activity occurs very rarely. This combination of scale scores indicates that the intensity of this UoA is negligible.

- · Spatial scale score = high, and temporal scale score = high.

Intensity score = high

Justification: The fishing activity covers almost half of the spatial distribution of the stock and the fishing activity occurs frequently. This combination of scale scores indicates that the intensity of this UoA is severe.

- · Spatial scale score = low, and temporal scale score = high.

Intensity score = high

Justification: The spatial overlap between the fishing activity and the stock distribution is extremely low, and the fishing activity occurs frequently. This combination of scale scores indicates that the intensity of this UoA is severe as the fishing activity has frequent impacts on a small part of the stock.

GPF8.7 SICA Step 5: Identify the most vulnerable subcomponent of the ecosystem, and score the consequence of the activity on the subcomponent

## GPF8.7.1 ▲

Subcomponents are indicators of health.

## GPF8.7.4.1 ▲

If the scale and intensity are scored as medium or high risk, the team should provide additional information to justify a low or medium risk score for consequence.

The team should consider stakeholder perception in combination with additional qualitative and quantitative information to support the consequence score. Without such information, the team should score consequence score as high risk and fail the UoA.

## GPF8.8.2.2 ▲

The team may reduce default high risk scores (due to a lack of information) if studies revealed the risk level was actually lower. For example, if the SICA results in a consequence score of 80 but additional information is available and presented that justifies raising this score, the team may give a final MSC score of 85.

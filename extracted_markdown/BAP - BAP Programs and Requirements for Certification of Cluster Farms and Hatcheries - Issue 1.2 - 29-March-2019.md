## Best Aquaculture Practices Programs &amp; Requirements for Certification of Cluster Farms and Hatcheries

Issue 1.2 29-March-2019

## 1.0 Introduction

- 1.1 The Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) is a voluntary certification program developed by the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA).  The BAP Standards cover the entire aquaculture production chain which includes hatcheries, farms, feed mills and processing plants.  The BAP program offers participants a way to demonstrate their commitment to supplying safe, environmentally- and socially responsible aquaculture food products.
- 1.2 Farms and Hatcheries/Nurseries can participate in the BAP program as individual facilities, or as part of a coordinated set of facilities, which are described and further defined in this document as Facility CLUSTERS .  Details concerning ways sponsoring organizations can bring clustered facilities into the BAP certification program are described in this document.
- 1.3 Under the CLUSTER program, sponsoring organizations coordinate the certification process of multiple facilities to reduce costs of certification.  All member facilities in BAP's CLUSTER program must be audited each year to the full scope of the relevant BAP Farm or Hatchery Standard annually.

## 2.0 Definitions

## 2.1 BAP Farm and Hatchery/Nursery Standards

- 2.1.1 The BAP FINFISH AND CRUSTACEAN FARM, SALMON FARM, and MOLLUSK FARM STANDARDS, and  the BAP FINFISH, CRUSTACEAN and MOLLUSK HATCHERIES AND NURSERIES STANDARD assess key elements related to environmental and social responsibility, animal welfare, food safety and traceability practices within the aquaculture production chain.
- 2.1.2 All species that are approved for certification under these BAP standards are eligible to certify under the sponsorship conditions described in this document

## 2.2 Sponsored Clusters

- 2.2.1 The BAP CLUSTER program has been developed to allow multiple facilities, without restriction in terms of size or volume of production, to become certified under the BAP program with the assistance of a sponsoring organization.
- 2.2.2 CLUSTERS may be organized under the sponsorship of a  processor, importer or buyer,  farmer cooperative or  association, or  other  legally  recognized entity  that wishes to coordinate the certification process for multiple facilities.
- 2.2.3 There  are  many  advantages  to  registering  facilities  under  the  BAP CLUSTER program.  All facilities in a CLUSTER are registered under a single application and pay a single application fee.  Auditing costs are also reduced, since an auditor can schedule audits of multiple facilities during a single trip.
- 2.2.4 Any reference to CLUSTERS in the subsequent portions of this document is referring specifically to SPONSORED CLUSTERS .

## 2.3 Sponsor

- 2.3.1 A SPONSOR is a legally recognized entity that is authorized to enter into agreements and  make  commitments on  behalf  of  the  associated facilities.    Examples  of SPONSORS include processing plants, importers or buyers, farmer cooperatives or clubs, or other aquaculture industry entities that are recognized by local/national authorities.
- 2.3.2 SPONSORs must assist in the coordination of the audit and certification process of sponsored  facilities  and must  have sufficient  resources  and management commitment  to  effectively  manage  these  matters  for  facilities  under their
- sponsorship.  SPONSORS are expected to take an active role in assuring that BAP requirements for  the  certification process  are  applied  to  all  facilities  they  are sponsoring.
- 2.3.3 Facilities  that  are  organized under  the CLUSTER facility  program must  have  a SPONSOR and must register together under the BAP certification program, following the conditions that are outlined in this document.

## 2.4 Coordinator

- 2.4.1 SPONSORS must  appoint,  train,  and  qualify  a COORDINATOR to  manage  the certification process and  assure  compliance with  all  requirements of  the  BAP Standards and  the  BAP Multi-Site CLUSTER Program.   The  BAP will  not  accept applications  for any kind of sponsored  facility unless the SPONSOR  has demonstrated that they have a properly-qualified COORDINATOR
- 2.4.2 Note : Reduced  audit  costs  are  dependent  upon  the COORDINATOR taking responsibility to ensure the facilities are in compliance and able to have their audits completed  within  the defined  time  frames.  If  it  becomes  evident  that  the COORDINATOR has  not  been  performing as  required,  the  BAP  may  at  its  sole discretion suspend the CLUSTER from the BAP program.

## 2.5 Certification Bodies (CBs)

- 2.5.1 CERTIFICATION BODIES are organizations that provide auditing and certification services.
- 2.5.2 Only BAP-authorized CB's may conduct audits for facilities seeking BAP certification.

## 2.6 Auditors

- 2.6.1 This is the person appointed by the CB to perform the audit.
- 2.6.2 CBs may only use BAP-accredited auditors to perform BAP audits.
- 2.6.3 The auditor does not need to be a senior BAP auditor to conduct Cluster audits.

## 3.0 BAP Rules and Procedures for Sponsoring Clusters

- 3.1 Qualified Sponsors: Any legal entity wishing to sponsor CLUSTERS may participate in the BAP CLUSTER program by following the procedures set out in this document.
- 3.2 Member Facilities : Participating sites must be enrolled as members of a CLUSTER ,  and the Sponsor shall have authority to represent all member facilities in matters relating to BAP certification.
- 3.2.1 Annual Production Limits: There is no limitation on the number, physical size and tonnage produced at the sites that comprise the CLUSTER ,  except  that  the CLUSTER must not be so large that it cannot be managed effectively.
- 3.2.2 Number of Facilities: CLUSTERS must be composed of no less than 2 facilities, and no  more than  10  facilities.   There  are  no  set  limits  concerning the  number  or dimensions of culture units within the individual member facilities of a CLUSTER .
- 3.2.2.1 Any exceptions to the limits on the maximum number of facilities in a CLUSTER will be at the sole discretion of the BAP.  An audit duration calculator will be employed by the BAP when considering any requests for exceptions to these limits, to ensure that all the audits can reasonably be expected to be completed by a single auditor during a single trip.
- 3.2.3 Same Species and Production Methods: Participating member facilities within a CLUSTER shall produce the same species and employ similar production methods and practices.  SPONSORS may not for example combine in the same CLUSTER both

In such a case, the COORDINATOR must formally advise the CB and BAP in a timely manner concerning  the  details  of  the  facility  that  is  to  be  removed from the CLUSTER .
- 3.2.6.2 Removing facilities from a CLUSTER will not affect the certification status of the remaining BAP-compliant facilities in the CLUSTER . Once removed from a CLUSTER , facilities may  only be added back into the CLUSTER during the following year's recertification application process.

## 3.3 The sponsoring entity must have the following documents in place:

- 3.3.1 Organizational chart showing the CLUSTER COORDINATOR and related positions.
- 3.3.2 Documented managerial commitment.
- 3.3.3 Record keeping system for all sites.
- 3.3.4 Agreements between all facilities and sponsoring entity.

## 4.0 Audit Process

- 4.1 Annual Audits
- 4.1.1 All Sponsored CLUSTER Facilities participating in the BAP program are subject to annual audits and must meet the requirements of the entire scope of the relevant BAP Standard and the requirements of the BAP CLUSTER Program.
- 4.1.2 Once the applications and other required steps previously mentioned have  been reviewed and verified by BAP as complete, the auditing and certification process can begin.
- 4.2 Audit and Certification Process and Independent Certification Bodies (CBs)
- 4.2.1 The  audits  are  conducted  by  independent  CBs,  who  manage  the  certification process. The CB will contact the SPONSOR to organize the audit process.
- 4.2.2 Each facility will be individually audited against the entire scope of the relevant BAP Standard,  and  the  CLUSTER  will  be  assessed using  a  supplemental CLUSTER Checklist , by an auditor chosen by the CB, and auditors will prepare separate full audit reports for each audited facility, and will report on the CLUSTER performance against the CLUSTER Program requirements. ( Note: SPONSORS AND COORDINATORS ARE HEREBY SPECIFICALLY NOTIFIED THAT A SUPPLEMENTAL CHECKLIST SHALL BE USED TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE OF THE SPONSOR AND COORDINATOR AGAINST SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS STATED IN THIS CLUSTER PROGRAM DOCUMENT. NON-COMPLIANCES CITED AGAINST THIS SUPPLEMENTAL CHECKLIST MUST BE ADDRESSED BY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AS A CONDITION OF CERTIFICATION FOR ALL MEMBER FACILITIES.)
- 4.2.3 Non-Conformity Definitions: Non-conformities raised during audits shall fall into one of the following three categories:
- 4.2.3.1 Critical  -  Where  there  is  a  Critical  failure  to  comply  with  a  legal, environmental, and social or food safety issue.  Or, a critical failure to comply with one or more fundamental requirements of the relevant BAP standard or BAP CLUSTER Program to the extent that it results in a risk to the integrity of the Scheme.  This would also include situations where there is a fundamental breakdown in the site's programs and systems to the extent that there is a critical overall failure to comply with the BAP Standard or BAP CLUSTER Program requirements.
- 4.2.3.2 Major - Where there is a substantial failure to meet the requirements of the intent of any clause of the relevant BAP standard or BAP CLUSTER Program.  But there is no Food Safety risk, issue of legality (including social  responsibility  requirements),  fundamental  systems  failure,  or immediate risk to the Integrity of the Scheme.
- 4.2.3.3 Minor - Where absolute compliance to the clause or intent of the BAP Standard or CLUSTER Program requirements has not been demonstrated.   Minor  non-conformities would  typically  be  technical deficiencies, small  missing elements,  small  record-keeping errors, or similar minor matters.
- 4.3 Instructions specific to Salmon and Mussel farm  CLUSTERS (normally sites OWNED or LEASED by a single Sponsoring company):
- 4.3.1 Salmon and Mussel farm audits must be coordinated and scheduled in advance with the CLUSTER Sponsor and will consist of two stages:
- 4.3.1.1 A  one-day audit performed at  the  Sponsor's regional headquarters to examine all company documents and records for operations of the sites to be certified as part of the CLUSTER program. If there is more than one region involved, the auditor may be required to spend additional time to review the information from each regional headquarter location.
- 4.3.1.2 In the second stage of the annual audit, individual facility audits will be conducted on the facilities in the area nearby each regional office.
- 4.3.2 The number of Salmon and Mussel farm sites that can be audited in one day will vary, depending on the distance between sites in the same zone. The number of audit days

will depend on the number of sites included in a CLUSTER ,  the distances between the sites, regulations for  transiting between zones,  and  the  locations of  the  regional offices where the documents are located. All active, producing sites that compose the CLUSTER unit will be visited at the time of the annual audits.  Should weather or logistical issues make it impossible for the auditor to travel to member sites during the annual audit, BAP shall be consulted for a decision concerning how to proceed.

- 4.3.3 BAP recognizes that for Salmon and Mussel farms, due to regulations (national or regional)  governing  zones,  or  due  to  provisions  in  an area's  voluntary  Area Management Agreement, most or all facilities in a given zone will normally be stocked and operating at the same time, or conversely may all be fallow ('all-in, all-out' style of production).
- 4.3.4 A majority of Salmon and Mussel farm sites in a CLUSTER must be stocked at the time of the annual CB audits, and BAP must be specifically advised concerning the expected dates when sites will be fallowed (if any). Salmon and Mussel CLUSTER facility audits are valid for one year.
- 4.3.5 Salmon and Mussel farms must assure that records for fallowed sites are maintained and  available,  to  facilitate auditor  reviews of  ongoing environmental monitoring, escape, feeding, and other such records from the previous crop cycle.

## 4.4 COORDINATOR involvement in audits

- 4.4.1 The COORDINATOR is responsible for assuring that CLUSTER member facilities are ready for the annually scheduled BAP audit.
- 4.4.2 The COORDINATOR or their designee must be present during all visits and audits.

## 4.5 Corrective actions to resolve non-conformities

- 4.5.1 Upon completion of  the  audit,  a  list  of  non-conformities will  be  provided to  the COORDINATOR .    It  is  the COORDINATOR 's  responsibility  to  see  that  proper  corrective actions for all non-conformities are forwarded in a timely manner to the CB for each facility.
- 4.5.2 Non-conformities raised during the  audit must be closed within twenty-eight (28) calendar days from the audit date.

## 4.6 Unannounced Audits

- 4.6.1 BAP reserves the right to have CBs auditors, or auditors separately assigned by the BAP Program Integrity department conduct unannounced audits on behalf of the BAP at  any  time.    Sponsors are  required to  cover  the  cost  for  unannounced  audits performed by  CB's  when  such  audits  are  carried  out  as  part  of  the  annual recertification process.

## ABSTRACT

Changes in water quality significantly shape fish behavior, a crucial index reflecting the growth and welfare status of fish. Given the centrality of this relationship to aquaculture practices, a comprehensive understanding of how water quality dynamics influence fish behavior is imperative. While there have been some summaries of the effects of water quality parameters on fish physiology and growth, few reviews on their effects on fish behavior have been reported yet. This article reviews several water quality parameters which are of great concern in aquaculture from multiple facets of actual production, including physical parameters (water temperature and turbidity), chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, salinity, pH, and inorganic nitrogen), and chemical pollutants (microplastics and crude oil), which have gained increasing attention from the researchers and aquaculture practitioners over the past decades. Variations in these water quality parameters can exert profound effects on fish physiology, metabolism, internal tissues and organs, and sensory perception, which influences fish behaviors such as swimming, schooling, feeding, predation, anti-  predation, aggression, courtship, as well as adaptive and stress-  related behaviors such as exploration, avoidance response, and anxiety-  like behavior. By synthesizing the behavioral changes caused by specific water quality parameters, this review aims to provide strong support for further water quality-  related research, thereby fostering environments conducive to both fish welfare and aquaculture productivity.

## 1   |   Introduction

As  a  crucial  source  of  high-  quality  animal  protein  and  micronutrients  for  human  consumption,  fish  make  significant contributions  to  global  food  supply  and  nutritional  security, which therefore making fish industry thrive [1]. For the past two decades, significant changes have been made in aquaculture production and management, which include the maintenance of traditional extensive aquaculture systems (e.g., pond, cage,  reservoir,  offshore  and  nearshore  aquaculture),  alongside the development of numerous innovative intensive aquaculture models (such as intensive cage, integrated aquaponics,

polyculture,  and  recirculating  aquaculture  systems  [RASs]) [2-7]. In all types of these aquaculture systems, fish interact with the water environment directly, highlighting the significance of maintaining optimal water quality for efficient fish farming, which plays an essential role in enhancing product quality and yield as well as fulfilling fundamental fish welfare necessities [8-10].

Water quality profoundly influences fish behavior and shapes their  intricate  adaptations  and  responses  aimed  at  optimizing survival  strategies  [11-14].  For  example,  uneven  temperature gradients can prompt fish to abandon their schools in search of preferred thermal areas, trading the safety of the advantages of schooling for individual comfort [15]. Such intrinsic drive based on  environmental  preferences  underscores  how  water  quality fundamentally shapes fish behavior [16-19]. On the other hand, from a physiological standpoint, suboptimal water quality can lead  to  stress,  such  as  osmoregulatory  imbalance,  impaired organ  function  as  well  as  hindered  sensory  systems  [20-25], among other issues, all of which can directly or indirectly impact fish behavior, such as irregular feeding, hindered courting patterns,  reduced  exploration,  increased  aggression,  and  even anxiety-  like behavior [26-31]. Such impacts can also have implications for fish welfare, including poor overall health and the inability to perform normal behaviors freely. By monitoring fish behavior, the aquaculture industry can optimize resource utilization, regulate water quality, and assess the welfare of farmed fish  [32,  33].  Therefore,  comprehensively  examining  the  relationship between water quality parameters and fish behavior is crucial for improving aquaculture practices.

Given this, this review centers on water quality parameters of importance  in  aquaculture,  and  categorizes  them  into  three broad groups: physical parameters (water temperature and turbidity),  chemical  parameters  (dissolved  oxygen  [DO],  salinity, pH, and inorganic nitrogen), and emerging its scope to address emerging  chemical  pollutants  (microplastics  and  crude  oil). Building upon these classifications, the review then directs attention  to  the  diverse  behaviors  exhibited  by  fish  in  response to these factors (Table 1), aiming to provide a robust scientific foundation for the linkages between fish behavior and sustainable aquaculture.

## 2   |   Methods

Databases  including  ScienceDirect,  Scopus,  Web  of  Science, Google Scholar were used for literature research in this review, following the combinations of the keywords: aquaculture AND/ OR fish farming; climate change; behavior; welfare; water temperature AND/OR thermal effect; turbidity; DO AND/OR hypoxia;  salinity;  pH  AND/OR  acidification;  ammonia  AND/ OR nitrate AND/OR nitrite; chemical pollutants; microplastics AND/OR nanoplastics; crude oil; swimming AND/OR locomotion;  schooling  AND/OR  group  behavior;  courting  AND/OR spawning  AND/OR  breed;  exploratory  behavior;  anxiety-  like behavior; antipredator behavior AND/OR forage; aggressive behavior. The publication year of the references mainly range from 2000 to 2024 and a small number of references related to the fundamental researches of fish behavior need to be traced back to the literature published in the last century.

This  review  categorizes  aquaculture  systems  into  two  broad types.  The  first  encompasses  extensive  outdoor  aquaculture, including  freshwater  pond/reservoir  aquaculture  along  with nearshore/offshore  marine  aquaculture;  the  second  category comprises  indoor,  intensive  aquaculture  systems,  with  a  primary focus herein on the increasingly popular RASs in recent years [54].  Marked by high densities, this mode of cultivation underscores the critical importance of collective behaviors and interindividual  interactions  as  pivotal  behavioral  indicators. While the majority of aquaculture practices involve monoculture, it is pertinent to acknowledge the existence of polyculture in certain non-  intensive outdoor systems, particularly prevalent in East and Southeast Asian regions, where multiple species are reared concurrently. Although the text primarily focuses on general implications, the inclusion of behaviors such as predation and antipredator  strategies  necessitates  this  acknowledgment. To preserve coherence and comprehensiveness, the discussion refrains from singling out specific aquaculture models, aiming instead to issue a broader alert relevant to the aquaculture sector and endeavors concerning fish welfare. Notably, not only aquaculture species were reviews here, some ornamental and wild species  were  also  adopted  to  supplement  the  relevant  views, which then provides valuable and comprehensive insights applicable to aquaculture.

## 3   |   Physical Water Quality Parameters

Physical  water  quality  parameters  constitute  a  set  of  indices used to assess the physical characteristics of water bodies. This chapter consolidates a review of the profound impacts that water temperature and turbidity exert on fish behavior, underscoring their  critical  roles  in  determining  fish  welfare  and  ecosystem dynamics.

## 3.1   |   Water Temperature

Fish, as ectothermic animals, rely on the aquatic environment for  thermoregulation,  making  water  temperature  one  of  the most crucial physical water quality parameters [55]. Their sensitivity to even minute variations in external water temperature is remarkable, with some species, like teleostean fishes, capable of  detecting  fluctuations  as  minor  as  0.03°C  [56].  Water  temperature fluctuations are common phenomena in aquaculture, even in the most controllable environment like indoor intensive aquaculture systems, where water temperature can still be disturbed by unexpected reasons like power failure and equipment malfunctions, let alone in extensive outdoor systems which are subject to the weather and climatic change; such variations in water temperature can impact fish to varying degrees, affecting behaviors  such  as  swimming,  schooling,  aggressive  behavior, exploratory  behavior,  courtship,  spawning,  and  predator-prey relationships, as detailed in the following section, reflecting the stress responses of fish to temperature changes (Figure 1).

the fish [57]. At low Reynolds numbers (i.e., low flow speed or low temperature), the viscosity of water is high, resulting in a greater drag force on fish and greater energy expenditure during swimming [57]. While this may not be significant for streamlined,  adult  fish,  it  can  have  a  substantial  impact  on  juvenile fish  whose  bodies  deviate  from  the  typical  streamlined  shape owing to  the  viscosity-  related  hydrodynamic  effect  caused  by low temperatures and its magnitude of influence increases with decreasing temperature [58]. However, the effects of temperature on swimming performance through physiological changes may outweigh those mediated by changes in water viscosity for larger fish or those in higher-  temperature environments [59].

Although fish may generally tolerate slow and rapid variation of water temperature in aquaculture environment due to seasonal or daily changes, fish inevitably alter behavior to ensure their swimming performance under this condition by changing their tail beat frequency, amplitude, and turning angle [60, 61], suggesting that temperature can regulate their behavior to maintain  optimal  swimming  performance,  potentially  driven  by intrinsic needs. Considering fish as ectothermic animals, water temperature  exerts  a  profound  influence  on  their  metabolic rates and energy allocation [62, 63]. Existing research indicates that lower water temperatures can reduce fish swimming velocities. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) acclimated to 28°C showed reduced swimming speeds at 24°C, while exposure to 30°C decreased immobility  duration  and  turning  angles  without  significantly altering  speed  [64].  On  the  other  hand,  when  water  temperature increases and surpass the optimal range for fish, increased oxygen consumption ensues, prompting fish to adopt a strategy of swimming slower to conserve energy [65]. The alteration of swimming  strategies  in  fish  due  to  temperature  changes  reflects  their  adaptive  capabilities  in  response  to  environmental shifts, yet it also indicates a compromise where they must adjust to maintain optimal conditions, thereby constraining their behavioral freedom and potentially impacting their welfare. It is noteworthy that the swimming strategies adopted by fish in response  to  temperature  fluctuations  are  heavily  influenced by  the  species  under  investigation  and  their  inherent  thermal  adaptation,  highlighting  the  significance  of  considering species-  specific and environmentally contextual factors in such research.

## 3.1.2       Schooling |

Schooling refers to a group of fish swimming in the same direction in a polarized and synchronized manner [38]. Schooling relies  on  cooperation among individuals and has a significant impact on normal activities. The benefits of forming a school include facilitating foraging and better predator resistance. In addition,  compared  with  individual  swimming,  swimming  in group  can  significantly  reduce  swimming  cost  [36,  38],  leading to a greater proportion of daily intake allocated for growth, which is critical in aquaculture production.

To keep the benefits of fish schools, the cohesion of schools must be maintained. A decline in cohesion within fish schools may reduce hydrodynamic drag leading to increased energy expenditure during swimming [36, 38]. This, in turn, can impact the daily energetic budget of individuals and potentially impair the collective  response of the group when confronted with stressors.  Some researchers use interindividual distance (IID, referring to the mean distance between the focal fish and any other ones) and nearest neighbor distance (NND, referring to the distance between the focal fish and its closest neighbor) to quantify  fish  school  cohesion  [37,  66].  At  lower  temperatures,  fish schools  exhibit  higher  cohesion  in  many  species,  which  show smaller values of IID or NND. For example, giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus )  show  smaller  average  NND  at  25°C  (average

NND = 4.04 cm) compared with 28°C (average NND = 9.34 cm) [67], delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ) exhibit larger average IID at 21°C (average IID = 37.36 cm) than at 17°C (average IID = 30.69 cm)  [60],  and  juvenile  walleye  pollock  ( Theragra chalcogramma ) have 32% shorter NND under colder conditions (2°C)  than  under  warmer  conditions  (9°C)  [68].  Such  effects allow them to maintain higher school cohesion in cooler environments, which, for juveniles, can offset the increased energy expenditure  caused  by  the  higher  water  viscosity  associated with lower temperatures to some extent [59]. Conversely, as temperature increases, school cohesion may decrease slightly. For example, brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) fry showed increased IID with rising temperatures (4°C-10°C), with the NND increasing most  significantly  [66].  Such  effects  mean  that  swimming  in warmer water regions may prevent them from effectively utilizing  the  hydrodynamic benefits of  schooling,  thus  requiring them to expend more energy, although muscle contractility and efficiency are better in the warmer waters [59].

Fish have the ability to use a neural thermoregulatory system to sense thermal signals from the environment, helping them avoid harmful temperatures and occupy preferred zones for growth and performance [69]. This spatial preference under temperature  gradients  or  fluctuations  significantly  affects  individual distribution within schools [70]. When the environmental temperature is close to the preferred temperature, individuals spend more time in school [15]. Conversely, if the temperature is not preferred, the fish balances the benefits of schooling against its temperature preferences, potentially leaving the school to seek a more favorable environment for metabolism and feed conversion [71, 72], which then results in a unique spatial distribution of fish schools in areas with varying temperatures.

## 3.1.3       Exploratory and Aggressive Behavior |

Exploratory behavior is used to evaluate the emotion state and stress response of fish [21, 45], and aggressive behavior in aquaculture cannot only increase energy expenditure, but also easily  lead  to  injuries,  diseases  or  death  among  the  cultured fish [26,  43,  44],  thereby  causing  loss  in  aquaculture  production. Both of these two behaviors are important indicators to assess fish welfare level. It is believed that exploration and aggression are associated with fish personality (including aggressiveness, exploration-  avoidance,  boldness-  shyness  [73]),  and  water  temperature can pose influences on them to some extent.

Exploration is a relatively complex behavior, involving physical capabilities and personality traits [45, 49, 74] related to boldness and shyness, primarily manifested as more time in risky areas like  the  top  and  bright  open  spaces,  and  keeping  away  from groups. In a study on mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis ), newborn fish raised at a lower temperature (25°C) showed different behavioral traits in adulthood: female fish exhibited repeated shyness and exploration, while male fish showed marginal repeated shyness, suggesting that environmental factors influencing fish in the early stage may shape behavior traits in adulthood; and mosquitofish reared at higher temperatures (30°C) were more exploratory  than  those  raised  at  lower  temperatures,  with  no difference  in  shyness  trait  [29].  The  promotion  of  exploratory behavior by higher temperature may be due to alterations in the central nervous system and modifications in protein synthesis and ATP production, as was pointed out in a serious of studies on zebrafish [49, 74, 75]. While it is inconclusive whether an increase or decrease in exploratory behavior is advantageous or detrimental to fish, as an increase in exploratory behavior may imply a higher likelihood of successful foraging despite a greater risk  of  predation  in  more  complex  outdoor  or  multi-  trophic aquaculture systems and may also increase the feeding rate in normal feeding process in aquaculture. From the perspective of fish  welfare,  to  promote  exploratory  behavior,  for  instance  by adding enrichment of aquaculture aquatic environment, signifies  an  increased  freedom  to  display  most  normal  behavioral patterns and enhancement of cognition and brain physiological functions [21, 76].

In terms of aggressive behavior, as one of the traits of fish personality as well, it mainly manifests in various forms including pursuit, biting, tail-  slapping, territorial disputes, and even cannibalism [43]. In most aquaculture production, although aggression is a part of natural fish behavior, excessive aggressiveness is considered detrimental to production. That is because aggression  implies  extra  energy  expenditure  and  even  lead  to  injuries and death, causing reduction in profit [26, 43, 44], and fish that lose fights in the aggression may be unable to escape from their victors, in which case they will suffer from chronic stress, causing  impairments  in  welfare.  Decreasing  temperature  can alleviate the aggressive behavior of some fish species. In neotropical  cichlids  ( Cichlasoma  paranaense ),  which  can  tolerate temperatures up to 39°C, gradually reducing the water temperature by 6°C from an initial 27°C was found to decrease aggressive  behaviors  in  both  individual  fish  and  groups;  conversely, when  the  water  temperature  was  gradually  increased  by  6°C from the same starting point of 27°C, no significant change in aggressive behavior was observed among the fish [77]. Similar conclusions were drawn in matrinxã ( Brycon amazonicus ) juvenile fish, where compared with the control group temperature (28.33°C ± 0.12°C),  lower  temperature  (24.09°C ± 0.15°C)  reduced the aggression of juvenile fish [78]. In general, alleviating the aggressive behavior of fish provides a less variable growth environment for fish individuals and decreases disease to some extent, which is beneficial for fish welfare in aquaculture [26].

## 3.1.4       Predator-Prey Relationship |

Predation  and  anti-  predation  affect  production  in  polyculture fish farming, a culture mode with more than a single species. Predators and prey often exhibit similar responses to temperature changes under lower temperature condition for the reason that most fish species tend to swim more slowly for the requirement of maintaining optimal swimming performance [79, 80], and low temperatures can constrain their ability to detect cues of predators or preys, making preys more vulnerable to predator attacks and predators more difficult to acquire food [81]. In addition, considering that both predators and prey in the water are  affected  by  increased  water  viscosity  due  to  low  temperatures, smaller-  bodied or deformative fish with odd body shapes experience  greater  resistance  and  energy  expenditure  during swimming, placing them in a disadvantageous position in the predator-prey  relationship  [58].  However,  in  some  cases,  the impact  of  low  temperature  on  predators  may  be  greater  than

that on prey because the neural performance of fish may be affected, which affects the coordination and perception of complex tasks such as rapid movement during predation, whereas escape  movement,  which  displays  some  degree  of  directional randomness, requires relatively lower neural performance [82]. When it comes to warmer waters, the antipredator behavior of fish would become stronger than that in colder waters, mainly because of the increase of muscle contraction speed, which affects  the  muscle  performance  and  power  output,  resulting  in greater power output and higher escape swimming performance [83, 84]. Likewise, this increased activity and swimming speed also improve the sensitivity of predators to prey and benefit pursuit and attack [85, 86].

## 3.1.5       Courting and Spawning |

Courting, the process by which fish attract potential mates, can  involve  emitting  sound  signals  in  some  species.  Sound signals emitted during courting, which are closely related to season  and  water  temperature,  are  stronger  during  warmer periods  from  early  spring  to  early  autumn  and  difficult  to detect  during  colder  winters  [53].  Spawning,  the  process  of releasing  eggs,  exhibits  diverse  behaviors  across  species.  In meagre  ( Argyrosomus  regius ), spawning-  related  chorusing is  strongest  at  an  average  water  temperature  of  15°C-25°C, peaking around 18°C, with drastic temperature changes causing the chorus to stop [87]. Furthermore, water temperature impacts fish spawning through its effects on reproductive hormones. For example, high temperatures can reduce spawning capacity  in  clownfish  ( Amphiprion  melanopus )  due  to  the thermal  sensitivity  of  reproductive  hormones  [88],  and  lowtemperature stress can lower reproductive behavior in guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ) due to a reduction in reproductive-  related traits [89]. Thus, for aquaculture aimed at increasing production, effectively regulating water temperature to ensure proper courtship and spawning of fish is crucial for the advancement of aquaculture development.

## 3.2   |   Turbidity

Turbidity, characterized by the degree to which suspended particles  obstruct  light  penetration,  is  a  key  physical  indicator  of water quality [90]. In aquaculture, the accumulation of feed and fish waste is a major contributor to water turbidity. Researchers have  classified  turbidity  into  organic  and  inorganic  turbidity based  on  the  underlying  causes:  organic  turbidity  is  mainly caused  by  eutrophication,  which  leads  to  the  proliferation  of algae  and  increases  the  water  turbidity;  inorganic  turbidity  is primarily  caused  by  precipitation  or  suspended  particles  [91]. An increase in water turbidity leads to reduced visibility, significantly influencing behaviors that are reliant on visual cues, especially  among  fish  that  mainly  depend  on  sight  for  activities [23], which then affects their feeding [27], predation, antipredation, courting, and mating, as well as the overall efficiency of fish schooling behavior [92] (Figure 2).

## 3.2.1       Feeding and Predation Relationship |

Turbidity can affect fish feeding behavior (predation efficiency and feeding rates) primarily by affecting the visual perception of  fish,  resulting  in  a  lower  success  rate  of  predation  [30].  In largemouth bass, primarily a visual predator, only 15% caught prey in a 250 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) environment compared  with  100%  in  a  0  NTU  environment  [93].  In  addition, the low availability of visual cues, mainly in polyculture

systems and outdoors systems, can also slow certain responses or decision-  making processes [94], leading to a slower foraging speed and declined efficiency [30], as seen in Picasso triggerfish ( Rhinecanthus aculeatus ), which linger with a slower search rate and take more time to find food [95]. Reduced predation efficiency and feeding rates, which can lead to declining yields, are undesirable in aquaculture. Fortunately, some fish have developed strategies to cope with the challenges posed by high turbidity. When visual information acquisition is limited by increased turbidity,  some  fish  rely  more  on  their  olfactory  senses  to  detect chemical cues, known as sensitivity plasticity [19, 96]. For example,  zebrafish  exposed  to  a  turbid  environments  showed a weaker response to visual stimuli but a stronger response to olfactory  stimuli,  indicating  a  shift  in  their  primary  sensory mode [19]. However, for predation, chemical cues may persist long after the prey leave, making them somewhat inaccurate, whereas visual signals can accurately and quickly grasp the position of prey [97]. Therefore, for the fish that rely on olfaction, lack the visual cues can lead to more cautious decision-  making as well due to the sense of fear [97]. Losing the freedom from fear can severely compromise their welfare in normal life.

Although turbid  water  affect  fish  that  rely  on  visual  cues  for predation, excessive low turbidity can also lead to poor feeding performance for some species. For example, pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca ) at low turbidity (0 FAU) had a 25% lower feed intake with slower feeding response than pikeperch at high turbidity (38 FAU) and a 10.5% lower compared with pikeperch at intermediate turbidity (15 FAU) [98]. Such slower feeding response in  low-  turbidity  water  may  not  be  due  to  visual  impairment but rather to low turbidity stress, as pikeperch naturally prefer dimmer  environments  for  foraging  [98].  From  a  fish  welfare perspective,  this  underscores  the  importance  of  adjusting  the aquaculture  environment  based  on  specific  species'  inherent turbidity preferences during the farming process.

Antipredator behavior, which rely on prompt responses to predator cues [99], is similarly impacted by turbidity. In polyculture models rearing several species of fish, especially in traditional pond aquaculture, turbidity can affect the predation and antipredation  behaviors  of  fish,  which  is  related  to  the  natural growth of mixed fish and affects the stability of the aquaculture ecosystem. In turbid water, visual cues are hindered, prompting some fish to behave more cautiously and increase their risk perception [94].  For  example,  mosquitofish reduced their activity and exploration in response to predator cues in turbid environments [100],  and  Stymphalia  minnow ( Pelasgus stymphalicus ) exposed to turbid environment exhibited hesitancy and reduced activity when leaving artificial refuges, even in the absence of predator cues [101]. These studies suggest that turbidity may elevate perceived predation risk and decrease exploratory behavior in prey species. However, the effect of turbidity on the prey is not always negative. Juvenile fish can benefit from high turbidity because suspended particles can form a protective cover, which allows them to conceal themselves and reduce predation pressure [23]. A study has found that Japanese anchovy ( Engraulis japonicus ) larvae in the high-  turbidity group (300 mg/L kaolin) showed  significantly  higher  survival  rate  when  exposed  to predators jack mackerel ( Trachurus japonicus )  compared with the ones in the low-  turbidity groups (0, 50 mg/L kaolin) [102]. Additionally, it should be noted that whether turbid water can act as a protective cover depends on the habitat of the fish [103]. If fish live in water with almost no shelter, high turbidity may be beneficial and their survival rate may be increased. To some extent, these phenomena reflect the diverse effects of turbidity on predation.

## 3.2.2       Courting |

Beyond predation and anti-  predation, turbidity also affects fish courting behavior. Some fish species use colorful appearances to attract mates, such as guppy [28] and cichlid [104]. However, excessive turbidity can impair visual cues, affecting the courting process. For example, male guppy displayed bright colors to court females but exhibited less frequent courting behavior in turbid water compared with clear-  water conditions, which hinders  female  mate  selection  [28].  Turbidity  negatively  impacts visual acuity and the effectiveness of visual communication in aquatic  systems  by  obscuring  visual  cues,  leading  to  reduced social  interaction  time  between  male  and  female  individuals within the fish group [105]. While visual cues become limited in turbid water, some fish still can use olfactory signals to compensate during courting. In a mate selection experiment with three-  spined  sticklebacks  ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ),  females  relied more on visual cues than olfactory cues in clear water but shifted to relying more on olfactory cues in organic turbid water containing algae ( Isochrysis sp.) [106]. This finding may suggest that  fish  can  adjust  their  reliance  on  different  cues  based  on environmental conditions when conducting courting behavior, choosing the most informative cues available.

## 3.2.3       Schooling |

Increasing  turbidity  also  negatively  impacts  fish  schooling behavior. For example, yellowtail ( Seriola quinqueradiata ) juveniles demonstrated increased NND and separation angles, indicating  weakened  cohesion  and  polarity  within  schools [92], and  guppies  displayed  reduced  activity  and  formed smaller  schools  in  turbid  conditions  compared  with  clear water,  showing  a  tendency  toward  more  solitary  behavior [107]. Furthermore, in another study using a V-  shaped decision  arena  (an  arena  is  a  well-  designed  device  or  tank  with a  particular  shape  to  reach  for  the  need  of  the  experiment where  fish  take  part  in),  three-  spined  sticklebacks  under turbid  conditions  shifted  from  collective  decision-  making to  more  individualistic  approaches,  a  behavioral  adaptation that  could  exacerbate  issues  such  as  uneven  food  allocation and diminished safety in numbers [94]. This behavioral shift also entails heightened caution, suggesting that fish in turbid environments behave more like isolated individuals than as cohesive  groups.  Consequently,  the  inherent  energy  conservation  benefits  typically  associated  with  schooling  behavior may be diminished in highly turbid waters. The synthesis of these  findings  reveals  profound  implications  of  turbidity  on fish behavior, particularly regarding social dynamics and behavior strategies. Notably, this section mainly synthesizes the impacts of inorganic turbidity on fish behavior, particularly on visual-  oriented behavior. However, in scenarios of organic turbidity caused by the presence of algae and other organisms, there  is  potential  for  decreased  or  fluctuating  DO  levels  in

the water, which introduces additional behavioral alteration resultant from oxygen deficiency [108] (Such behavioral alterations can be further explored in Section 4.1).

## 3.3   |   Summary

In summary, the effects of water temperature and turbidity on fish behavior are multifaceted and significant. As vital physical water quality parameters, temperature can alter water viscosity and influence metabolism, while turbidity can affect visibility, leading to behavioral variations or stress in fish. Maintaining water temperatures within ranges that support optimal metabolic efficiency can maximize growth rates and feed conversion ratio and controlling turbidity levels ensures normal behaviors, both of which are crucial for minimizing stress and improving overall fish well-  being, contributing to more sustainable aquaculture productivity.

## 4   |   Chemical Water Quality Parameters

Chemical water-  quality  parameters  are  indicators  used  to  describe  the  characteristics  and  contents  of  chemicals  in  water bodies. The chemical water quality parameters discussed in this chapter include DO, salinity, pH, and inorganic nitrogen, which are of great concern in aquaculture.

## 4.1   |   Dissolved Oxygen

DO is vital for the survival of aquatic organisms and is influenced  by  various  complex  factors.  In  aquaculture  production, large  inputs  of  feed,  excessive  stocking  density,  failure  to  use aerators can lead to a decrease in DO [109]. DO is more uncontrollable in extensive aquaculture systems than that in intensive mode, given the impact of weather changes. As an example, in the  rainy  season,  extensive  pond  aquaculture  experiences  reduced water solubility of oxygen, a consequence of inadequate sunlight exposure [110]. Additionally, seasonal environmental conditions such as summer thermal stratification and winter ice cover affect the distribution of DO in open water as well [111]. Under condition with oxygen deficiency, or hypoxia, fish maintain their oxygen uptake at the level of the standard metabolic rate  (SMR),  the  minimum  required  for  basic  functions  [112]. This may lead to respiratory difficulties, impaired movement, reduced appetite, and physiological responses, which then results in behavioral changes (Figure 3). Noted that, oxygen supersaturation, or hyperoxia, has been proved that it can pose a risk of physiological issues or diseases such as bubble gas disease in salmon [113, 114], highlighting the necessity for the appropriate DO management on species-  specific (freshwater or marine) and  system-  dependent  (intensive  or  extensive  environments) condition. However, due to the less common discussions of the impacts of hyperoxia on fish behavior and the more focused concerns in aquaculture over the effects of hypoxia, this section has focused on the influence of hypoxia on fish behavior.

## 4.1.1       Swimming and Avoidance Response |

Fish can perceive the level of oxygen in their living environment and whether it is suitable for their activities [115]. In coping with a low DO environment, fish exhibit two strategies to enhance survival under hypoxic conditions [116-118]. First, they reduce activity levels, exemplified by diminished swimming behavior, to curtail oxygen demands [117]. This strategy encompasses the adoption of burst-  and-  coast swimming, a highly efficient energy conservation  mechanism  characterized  by  intermittent  bursts of vigorous motion (the burst phase) followed by motionless intervals with a streamlined posture (the coast phase) [119]. For example, hypoxia frequently prompted species like the Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua )  and red drum ( Sciaenops ocellatus )  to increase  the  frequency  of  burst-  and-  coast  swimming,  enabling

them to sustain swimming velocities with reduced energetic expenditure [120, 121]. Second, fish may elevate their activity to rapidly locate regions with higher oxygen concentrations. This includes behaviors such as swimming to the water surface for aquatic  surface  respiration  (ASR)  [116,  118,  122].  The  golden grey mullet ( Liza aurata ) has demonstrated a substantial rise in ventilation frequency upon exposure to reduced oxygen saturation levels, ranging from 10% to 40%; when oxygen saturation plummeted to 15%, they engaged in ASR, illustrating an adaptive strategy to mitigate oxygen deprivation [116]. Similarly, the Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) has been observed to initiate ASR when the oxygen partial pressure in the culture water decreased below 2.1 kPa [122], highlighting a comparable threshold of different species for adopting compensatory mechanisms under hypoxic conditions.

Both strategies employed by fish in response to hypoxic conditions  involve  different  'considerations.'  The  pursuit  of  potentially oxygen-  rich areas may inadvertently guide fish into further hypoxic zones or expose them to different stressors [123, 124], such as somewhere with suboptimal temperatures, light intensities  or  even  stress  from  predators.  Conversely,  confining  activity within zones of marginally tolerable DO, though limiting spontaneous swimming, conserves vital oxygen and energy resources  for  alternative  physiological  processes  [123],  although it  does  not  fully  alleviate  the  detrimental consequences of hypoxia. It follows that the strategic modulation of activity levels represents a pivotal adaptive response to hypoxia, underscoring the  complex  interplay  between  environmental  challenges  and fish survival strategies.

## 4.1.2       Predation Relationship |

In predator-prey relationship, hypoxia influences both the predation of the predators and the anti-  predation responses of the prey  by  constraining  their  swimming  abilities  and  fast-  start process, encompassing responsiveness and directionality [125]. Fast-  start  happens  at  the  point  of  preys  sensing  predator  signals and predators starting to hunt after finding targets. Most researchers divide fast-  start into two stages: (1) First body bend (C- or S-  shaped) caused by muscle contractions. This stage begins at the start of the sensing signals and ends when the head stops turning or changes direction. (2) Second body bend, which begins at the end of stage one and ends when the head stops turning or changes direction [126]. Fast-  start movements, executed under anaerobic metabolism, rely on anaerobic muscle energy for  sudden  acceleration  to  maximum speed, and it was previously believed that hypoxia does not affect this escape movement [127]. However, certain performance-  related escape behaviors, such as responsiveness and directionality, are related to brain and sensory functions and are negatively affected by hypoxia. This not only affects the capacity to perceive predators (i.e., vigilance against predators) [128], but also the capacity to judge direction during the escape process. For instance, the avoidance and approach responses of sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) were random  when  escaping  responses  occurred  when  the  oxygen level  dropped  to  or  below  50%  oxygen  saturation,  suggesting impaired  direction  discrimination  mediated  by  mechanosensory systems [129]. Furthermore, escape responses are often incomplete under hypoxia, favoring single-  bend responses due to their lower energy costs, which have been suggested to be more common under conditions of reduced swimming performance [126]. Noted that, although escape is powered by anaerobic metabolism, it requires an aerobic recovery phase, which may be limited by hypoxia in fish, resulting in severe oxygen debt and constraining the ability to perform repeated fast-  starts [130].

In predator-prey relationships, hypoxia also challenges the lowoxygen  tolerance  of  fish,  which  enables  preys  to  use  hypoxic environments  as  refuges  to  evade  predators,  as  demonstrated in red drum [131, 132], and enables predators to forage in hypoxic  areas  when  prey  abundance  is  low  in  oxygen-  sufficient surface  waters,  as  revealed  in  yellow  perch  ( Perca  flavescens ) [133]. Despite this, while hypoxia may not necessarily increase the probability of fish being preyed upon by other fish, predators unaffected by water oxygen levels, such as birds and aquatic mammals, may exploit the disadvantages of fish escaping under hypoxic conditions to hunt them [84, 125], such as when fish engaging in ASR. To mitigate this risk, some fish adopt strategies as part of their antipredator behavior, such as surfacing irregularly or synchronously with other fish to reduce predation risk [134].  Fathead  minnows  ( Pimephales  promelas ),  for  instance, dive  swiftly  below  the  surface  upon  detecting  alarm  signals while engaging in ASR and quickly return to the surface without  reducing  their  activity  [111].  This  indicates  that  fish  have strategies  to  cope  with  the  risks  of  hypoxia,  despite  suffering from impaired response and weakened swimming capacity.

## 4.1.3       Schooling |

Although  the  formation  of  schools  has  many  advantages  for fish,  uneven distribution of DO remains prevalent within fish schools,  with  the  consumption  of  oxygen  by  fish  at  the  leading  edge  of  the  group  causing  a  decrease  in  DO  along  the  direction of schooling movement, making fish positioned toward the rear more prone to hypoxia [135]. Thus, schooling involves a tradeoff between individual oxygen demand and interest demand such as hydrodynamic benefits. In fish schools, different individuals occupy distinct positions in the school at different times as shuffling frequently occurs during school movement [135], thus enabling hypoxic individuals to move to areas with relatively more oxygen. Under this circumstance, hypoxia has a great impact on fish school size. As water oxygen concentration  decreases,  the  volume  of  the  school  expands  particularly in width instead in length, because fish at the same horizontal level can obtain hydrodynamic advantages, by which fish can save swimming cost more easily and the phenomena that fish at the rear become increasingly hypoxic may be prevented [136]. As the oxygen concentration decreases further, the schools continue to expand until they reach a certain point, at which point they may disperse and break down into several smaller schools to  better  cope with hypoxia [117]. These findings suggest that oxygen continually regulates fish schooling and is an important factor in determining schooling capacity.

This section has focused on reviewing the impacts of hypoxia on fish swimming, predator-prey relationships, and schooling. Related behavioral alterations reflect the adaptive strategies in response  to  hypoxic  environments.  Considering  these  effects of  hypoxia  on  fish  behavior  as  evidenced  in  multiple  studies,

the  further  adverse  impacts  under  severe  hypoxia  underscore the detrimental influence on normal activities and lives of fish, which  necessitates  careful  consideration  and  management  in practical aquaculture systems.

Salinity is used to measure the total concentration of inorganic ions  in  water.  With  global  atmospheric  changes  and  elevated anthropogenic  pollutants  entering  natural  open  waters,  varying  degrees  of  salinity  pollution  occur  in  many  water  areas [137, 138]. This negatively affects the growth of aquatic organisms  and  ultimately  disrupts  outdoors  aquaculture  systems, both in ocean water or fresh water areas [139]. Fish inevitably experience salinity stress due to frequent variability in salinity levels, particularly in nearshore areas or in brackish water inland regions, where freshwater inputs cause salinity to fluctuate, necessitating tolerance of wide salinity ranges. Otherwise, living in an environment with inappropriate salinity or frequent salinity fluctuations has been found to lead to an osmotic imbalance between the fish body and the external environment [140], and to impair the sensory system [20], particularly the olfactory system, affecting in fish behavior (Figure 4).

## 4.2.1       Osmosis Imbalance-  Induced Behavioral Changes |

When confronted with salinity stress, fish have to adopt physiological  strategies  to  cope  with  osmotic  imbalance  [22,  140]: ions transportation occurs in fish to maintain osmotic balance, where  the  reactions  can  be  found  in  the  aquaporins  and  ion channels/pumps in their gills and intestines [141, 142]. However, some of these ion transport pathways consume considerable energy and can influence energy allocation and the metabolic rate

[143-145]. Therefore, as a compensatory strategy to cope with the cost of osmoregulation, some fish reduce activities, or have a higher cost of energy expenditure to move under salinity stress, which is not conducive for swimming, predation, anti-  predation, and spawning [146-148].

Some fish are able to make a tradeoff between their preferred salinity range and potential stress. For example, smolts, known as  the  salmonid  in  a  particular  life  stage  when  they  undergo physiological changes for the migration from fresh habitat to the ocean,  experience  dynamics  salinity  fluctuations  and  tend  to prefer shallow ocean areas with lower salinity (&lt; 20 psu) to avoid sea lice [149], which inhabit environments with salinity higher than 20 psu [149]. When confronted with inappropriate salinity, fish need to balance the requirement to maintain their current osmotic balance with the need to relocate in order to alleviate stress, based on their adaptive osmoregulation strategies [150]. To mitigate salinity stress, fish must have an accurate perception of their surroundings, such as the ability to sense changes in ambient sodium and chloride levels, and the capacity to migrate away from high-  stress areas promptly [151, 152]. However, when the water salinity exceeds the tolerance threshold of fish, the dehydration and declined swimming capacity come to fish so that they may not be able to migrate from high-  stress areas to  preference location [145], even if they are able to sense the salinity stress in this case.

## 4.2.2       Impaired Olfaction-  Induced Behavioral Changes |

In  addition  to  impairing  osmotic  imbalance,  salinity  can  affect fish behavior by impairing olfactory sensory fish [20, 153]. Inappropriate ambient salinity may interact with the olfactory receptors of fish or act on the alarm cues directly, leading to a decrease in the availability of olfaction [146], which can limit the

FIGURE 4 |    Abnormal behaviors caused by inappropriate salinity.

<!-- image -->

capacity of fish to perceive environmental chemical cues such as certain ions [154] and endocrine disruptors [20], potentially impairing their antipredator responses, such as detecting risk cues. For instance, fathead minnows undergoing high-  salinity treatment (8000 ppm) reduced the response of antipredator behavior compared with low-  salinity treatment (1000 ppm), reflected in a  decreased percent change in movement distance before and after predator  stimuli  ((poststimulus-prestimulus)/prestimulus)  [146].  Without the ability to sense risks, fish may be subjected to constant stress and find it difficult to display normal behavior  freely  [76].  Moreover,  salinity  not  only  interact  with the olfactory receptors but also be associated with the change in the expression of genes related to olfaction, demonstrated in a study on salmonid fish migration [153]. Salinity plays a vital role in this important life cycle due to its influence on spawning related  physiological  activity,  encompassing  the  release  of  related hormone, such as cortisol, and the olfactory-  related memories during migration [153]. Significant fluctuations in salinity during this process can impact migration, indirectly affecting the spawning success. This phenomenon provides insights for aquaculture  practices,  emphasizing  the  necessity  for  rigorous control of water salinity for species that are highly dependent on specific salinity regimes.

From  a  welfare  perspective,  chronic  stress  from  exposure  to inappropriate salinity can lead to reduced fitness and compromised  welfare  with  osmosis  imbalance  or  impaired  olfaction, which highlight the importance of maintaining stable and optimal salinity levels in aquaculture systems, especially in aquaculture systems characterized by fluctuating water salinity, such as marine and offshore operations. Additionally, understanding the behavioral responses of fish under different salinity conditions  can  assist  farmers  in  implementing  better  management practices, ensuring healthier and less stressed fish populations.

## 4.3   |   pH

Water pH is used to measure the acidity and alkalinity of water. Intensive  aquaculture  systems,  notably  RAS,  maintain  stable control over water quality, minimizing pH fluctuation impacts. Conversely,  outdoor  aquaculture,  both  in  freshwater  and  marine, is more susceptible to external environment, such as more solution  of  atmospheric  additional  emission  of  carbon  dioxide due  to  human  activities  [155].  These  factors  collectively  challenge the stability of outdoor extensive aquaculture systems.

The suitable range of pH for farmed fish is species-  specific for optimal physiological activities, and deviation from this range can alter fish behavior, such as swimming. For example, the critical velocity of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) at water pH4, 5, and 10 was only 55%, 67%, and 61%, respectively of that in water of pH7, and fatigue occurred earlier in fish swum to exhaustion in acid or alkaline condition, compared with fish in neutral condition [156], both of which indicated that fish in inappropriate range of pH might expend more energy on swimming, resulting the potential problem that fish divert energy away from growth to normal activities. Some species are highly sensitive to environmental pH levels; for example, land-  locked sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) will attempt to avoid areas with pH levels below 6.0 during their upstream migration, even in response to slight pH changes [157]. Furthermore, Brook Char ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) and Arctic Char ( Salvelinus alpinus ) were also found that they exhibited avoidance responses to unsuitably low pH environments  (&lt; 5.5)  [158,  159].  Thus,  it  has  been  speculated that salmon may be able to perceive the pH of their surroundings and respond accordingly [157]. Nevertheless, the impact of pH on fish behavior extends beyond these direct effects: acidified water can impair the olfactory senses to response to chemical cues in most fish species, consequently altering behaviors that are ordinarily guided by olfaction [24, 160, 161].

Fish can use olfactory function to discriminate chemical cues [162], which is crucial in shaping their olfactory-  mediated behavior, including their responses to risks [163], feeding [160, 164], and  habitat  selection  [165].  For  example,  due  to  the  potential issue that olfactory neurones are impaired and olfactory sensitivity  to  chemical  cues  is  reduced  under  acidic  conditions,  orange clownfish ( Amphiprion percula ) were found to be unable to effectively use olfactory cues to locate their habitat under simulated acidified conditions (pH7.6), compared with conditions under seawater (pH8.15) [165]; similarly, fathead minnows, finescale dace ( Phoxinus neogaeus ), and rainbow trout struggled to detect conspecific alarm cues under mildly acidic conditions (pH6.0),  compared  with  normal  pH  conditions  (pH7.0-7.2) [166]. Importantly, such olfactory dysfunction may persist over extended durations, even after leaving from the acidic areas, observed in a study in which fathead minnows failed to exhibit feeding responses typically elicited by strong chemical stimuli after returning to their original habitat (pH8.1) after exposure to an acidic environment (pH6.0) for 72 h, indicating a lingering effect on their chemosensory capabilities [160]. These phenomena occur not only in acidic water but also in water that experiences pH fluctuations caused by precipitation, which can temporarily lead to a sluggish response of fish to alarm signals, as found in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) [163]. In addition to impaired olfactory neurons, fish in acidic environments may experience degraded chemical cues [24] or reduced affinity of these cues for odorant receptors [167], which can transmit incorrect information or obstruct information transmission, leading to a loss of  the  capacity  to  make  correct  decisions.  For  instance,  when eggs  and  larvae  of  clownfish  were  exposed  to  simulated  acid seawater (pH7.8), they lost the capacity to distinguish between predators and non-  predators and were strongly attracted to the smell of predators [161], which alters antipredator behaviors and elevates the likelihood of predation, profoundly disadvantaging their healthy development.

The disruption of chemical signals by pH, in addition to affecting olfactory perception related to predation and anti-  predation, also impacts gustatory sensitivity of fish [25, 168]. pH may alter the  binding  kinetics  of  specific  amino  acids  to  available  taste cell  receptors,  changing  their  perceived  intensity  and  quality, thus inhibiting or enhancing the effect of particular amino acids [169], which in turn affects fish appetite. Furthermore, studies have shown that lower pH can stimulate the release of cholecystokinin and peptide in the intestine, substances that inhibit appetite, leading to reduced feeding in fish [170]. Therefore, it is believed that lower pH significantly impacts fish appetite, decreasing their feeding rate, which has substantial implications in  aquaculture  systems  that  require  feeding  [169].  In  Atlantic salmon,  lower  pH  has  been  observed  to  decrease  feeding

response  and  reduce  food  intake,  to  the  detriment  of  growth [171],  with  significant  implications  for  nutritional  status  and overall health. Moreover, similar results was found in yellowtail kingfish ( Seriola lalandi )  reared  in  RAS:  fish  in  water  with  a pH of 6.58 ate significantly less food than those in waters with pH7.16 [172]. Given the impact of pH on fish behavior, particularly on olfactory and gustatory responses, researchers predict that  decreasing  open-  water  pH  levels  may  impair  fish  ability to respond to chemical sensory signals [165]. This impairment could reduce rapid responses to food [173], potentially leading to reduced feeding efficiency, which may result in slower growth, malnutrition, and increased vulnerability to disease, ultimately causing significant losses in aquaculture.

## 4.4   |   Inorganic Nitrogen

Nitrogen in water exists mainly in the forms of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate [174]. In aquaculture, excess feed and fish excrement are the primary causes of increased nitrogen levels in the water, which often result from high stocking densities or poor water quality management [175]. In this article, we review the effects of these three types of inorganic nitrogen on fish behavior like swimming and feeding.

## 4.4.1       Ammonia |

Ammonia  (NH 3 )  is  a  common  pollutant  in  aquaculture  due to  decomposition of biological waste [176]. Intensification and high-  density can easily lead to increased ammonia production in  aquaculture  systems  [177].  When  it  comes  to  open  water bodies, excessively much ammonia can even result in acidification or eutrophication of oceans or rivers [174], served as a typical aquaculture stressors (Figure 5).

Ammonia, in its free (NH ) and ionized (NH 3 4 + )  forms,  poses significant threats to fish health, with the unionized form being particularly  hazardous  due  to  its  greater  permeability  across gill  membranes  [176].  Although  the  capacity  to  tolerate  high ammonia levels varies between fish species and depends on the duration of exposure, exposure to elevated ammonia levels triggers a cascade of detrimental effects on fish, for example, yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares ) exposed to ammonia levels of 5-10 mg/L for over 24 h experience severe oxidative stress [178], rainbow trout exposed to approximately 1 mg/L of ammonia for more than 24 h show a significant reduction in feeding [179], and Indian carp ( Labeo rohita ) exposed to 3 mg/L of ammonia for an extended period suffer gill damage and experience a significant increase in oxygen consumption rate [180]. These negative effects are likely to manifest in fish behavior, like swimming and aggression,  even  at  sublethal  dose.  Following  paragraphs  will present these behavioral effects of fish subject to acute as well as chronic exposure to ammonia.

In some aquaculture systems, such as RAS, operational disturbances may periodically cause similar irregularities,  such  as low efficiency in biological filtration, leading to short-  term and high levels of ammonia, which can typically be attributed to improper water quality management [181, 182]. Such irregularity may lead to the result that fish acutely or chronically expose to ammonia. Acute exposure of fish to environmental ammonia  (short-  term  exposure  to  high  concentration  of  ammonia) leads to adverse effects, and fish need to undertake a series of

With the involvement of Rh glycoproteins and some ion channels; the process of ammonia excretion is re-established[ 192].

## Some of the negative impacts may restored or mitigated, such as [179,189]

behavioral responses or strategies to cope. The initial behavioral responses of fish acutely exposed to excessive ammonia levels include reducing or stopping feeding [176, 183]. Loss of appetites have been observed in fish exposed to external ammonia, such as rainbow trout [179] and Mediterranean barbel ( Barbus meridionalis )  [184]. This may be because the decomposition of ingested proteins can lead to a sudden increase in ammonia levels inside the body. Under excessive ammonia, the excretion of ammonia through the gills is inhibited and ammonia may even diffuse into the fish body from the outside [185], resulting in the rapid accumulation of ammonia inside the body [186].  Therefore,  reduced  food  intake  as  an  efficient  strategy could  protect  fish  from  significant  further  increases  in  postprandial blood ammonia level to minimize toxic effects [183]. In addition to food intake, ammonia production in fish can be also attributed to stress and increased metabolism caused by stress  and  exercise  [176,  187].  In  this  situation  under  acutely excessive environmental ammonia stress, another strategy for fish to prevent the rapid accumulation of ammonia is to reduce exercise  [176].  For  example,  rainbow  trout  and  zebrafish  exposed to excessive ammonia levels exhibited reduced activity levels and decreased aggressive behavior [188, 189]. However, the  effects  of  acute  exposure  to  environmental  ammonia  in fish contrast with those of chronic exposure, wherein the stress persists over an extended period. Unlike acute exposure, when chronically exposed to environmental ammonia, satiated fish demonstrated  higher  efficiency  in  excreting  ammonia  than hungry  fish  and  experienced  relatively  less  ammonia  stress during  exercise,  with  less  accumulation  of  ammonia  in  the blood, compared with starved fish [190, 191]. This may be attributed to the possibility that feeding increases the metabolic rate of fish and leads to an elevated oxygen consumption rate, ultimately  promoting  ammonia excretion [191].  Such  mechanisms indicate that  fish  have  behavioral  strategies  to  reduce ammonia toxicity when exposed to acute or chronic nonlethal ammonia levels. As exposure time prolongs, the involvement of Rh glycoproteins and certain ion channels helps re-  establish the process of ammonia excretion [192]. This physiological regulation facilitates the recovery of ammonia excretion capability [185],  thereby  mitigating  behavioral  changes  observed  under ammonia stress, such as reduced appetite [179], decreased activity levels, and diminished aggression [189].

Exposure to ammonia environments can lead to the accumulation  of  ammonia  in  various  tissues  or  organs  within  fish. The accumulation of ammonia in muscle tissue, especially in white glycolytic muscles which enable fish to acquire a large amount of energy within a short time through anaerobic metabolism, can cause muscle damage and affect energy supply [186]. And the accumulation in the brain can significantly impair the reflex arc neural function and related sensory systems in  fish  [193],  which  can  greatly  result  in  a  reduction  in  the response ability as well as directional confusion during movement [186].  In  addition,  it  was  also  observed  that  ammonia can damage the lateral line sensory system which is essential for  perceiving  environmental  information.  All  these  effects mentioned above can lead to difficulties in maintaining optimal  behavior  performance,  including  normal  swimming performance, predation and anti-  predation [194, 195], placing fish  at  a  disadvantage  in  competitive  relationships  between different species (or inter-  species relationship), as observed in a study on brown trout, where a decrease in swimming performance after ammonia exposure led to a significant reduction in capture success [186]. Notably, ammonia cannot only affect inter-  species relationships but may also have an impact on community structure within the same species, which manifest as hierarchical structures within the same species group [186, 189]. This is evident in a study on rainbow trout, where hierarchical  structure  could  be  maintained  at  relatively  low ammonia concentration, with a decline in activity levels manifested as reduced aggression, but the stable structure no longer existed at higher ammonia concentration [189]. Although these sublethal effects mentioned above may not directly lead to death, fish may loss the capacity to cope with or adapt to environmental variations.

## 4.4.2       Nitrate |

Nitrates ( NO 3 -), a common and widespread stressor within various  aquatic  environments,  mainly  originate  from  the  aerobic chemoautotrophic bacterial oxidation of ammonia. As the most stable form of inorganic nitrogen, nitrate represents a concern for water  quality  management  within  aquaculture  systems [196, 197]. In cases where water quality maintenance is inadequate, long-  term exposure of fish to nitrate can induce chronic stress on fish [198].

Chronic  exposure  to  high  or  low  concentration  of  nitrate may contribute  to  fish  vulnerability  to  hypoxia  stress  [199], as demonstrated in European grayling ( Thymallus thymallus ) [200] and silver perch ( Bidyanus bidyanus ) [199], showing that fish  chronically  exposed  to  varying  nitrate  concentrations utilized the aquatic surface respiration earlier and increased ventilation rates in environments with progressively decreasing oxygen levels, due to the histopathological changes in the gills  induced  by  nitrates,  which  limits  oxygen  uptake  [200]. Furthermore,  nitrate-  induced  stress  has  been  implicated  in the manifestation of anxiety-  like behaviors in fish, characterized  by  prolonged  dwelling  near  the  tank  bottom,  resulting in more time spent on decision-  making behavior and weaker associative learning capabilities [31, 201]. These phenomena were  observed  in  zebrafish  exposed  to  nitrate  with  a  concentration  of  606.9 mg/L.  Yet,  in  high-  density  aquaculture settings, elevated nitrate levels are common. Although these impacts are generally species-  specific, it is worth underscoring the need to be vigilant about the potential implications of such increases on fish health and welfare.

Nonetheless, the influence of nitrate on fish behavior may not always be adverse outcomes. An research has indicated that sustained  exposure  to  nitrates  below  100 mg/L  did  not  give rise to any abnormalities in swimming behavior of post-  smolt Atlantic  salmon cultured in replicate freshwater RAS [202], suggesting a species-  specific threshold exists beneath which nitrate  may  not  impose  detrimental  effects.  Furthermore, moderate levels of nitrate have been found to bring about some beneficial effects, including increasing the supply of metabolic fuels by promoting the use of less oxygen-  demanding energy sources [203], and decreasing the oxygen demand during exercise by enhancing muscle metabolic efficiency [204]. These adaptations can potentially translate into positive behavioral

outcomes, such as increased activity levels and improved performance  during  exercise.  Despite  these  potential  benefits, the consideration surrounding nitrate in aquaculture predominantly centers on its detrimental impacts, rendering the practical application of its positive aspects in aquaculture contexts challenging.

## 4.4.3       Nitrite |

While nitrite ( NO 2 -) levels seldom exceed the tolerance limits of fish  in  traditional  extensive  aquaculture  systems,  high  nitrite levels  are  often  encountered  in  intensive  aquaculture  system [205]. Nitrite, usually produced in oxygen-  deficient locations like bottom muds [205], is much more harmful to aquatic organisms than nitrate and is recognized as one of the most toxic inorganic nitrogen substances [206]. Abundant studies focus on the factors that influence the toxicity of nitrite and its effects on fish physiology, but its impact on fish behavior remains unclear [205, 207].

Studies on Chinese perch ( Siniperca chuatsi )  [208],  rainbow trout  [209],  and  goldfish  ( Carassius auratus )  [210]  indicated that  long-  term  exposure  to  low  nitrite  concentrations  can reduce fish appetite and affect feeding behavior. One of the reasons is that nitrite exposure can impact the olfactory system and ability  to  detect  food  [210],  leading  to  a  slow  feeding  rate  and,  in  some  cases,  cessation  of  responses  to  food [209]. In addition, exposure to nitrite can impair the oxygen uptake capacity of fish as well [205]. The most noticeable behavioral  manifestations  in  aquaculture  include  gasping  at the  water  surface,  with  excessive  respiration,  and  frequent gill covers flipping [205, 211], resulting from nitrite converting hemoglobin into methemoglobin, which cannot transport oxygen as hemoglobin does [206]. Consequently, even when the DO content in aquaculture water reaches optimal levels, affected  fish  may  frequently  exhibit  signs  of  hypoxia  [206]. These physiological effects can significantly affect health and can manifest through behavioral performance [212], such as decreased  swimming  speed,  as  observed  in  striped  catfish ( Pangasianodon  hypophthalmus ) [213],  catla  ( Labeo  catla ), rohu ( Labeo rohita ), and mrigal ( Cirrhinus mrigala ) [211].

## 4.5   |   Summary

The  chemical  water  quality  parameters  attract  attention  of farmers  in  both  intensive  and  especially  extensive  outdoor aquaculture due to their multifaceted influences on fish behavior. While the mechanisms by which various parameters influence fish behavior are distinct, ranging from DO affecting metabolic processes and energy supply, to salinity influencing osmoregulatory balance and olfactory perception, and pH affecting olfaction and gustation, and inorganic nitrogen impacting  accumulation  within  the  fish  body,  fish  show  an inherent  ability  to  adapt  to  environmental  changes  through behaviors.  Certain  chemical  water  quality  factors  are  perceived  by  fish,  which  then  force  fish  to  conduct  behavioral strategies to maintain their physiological state. In conclusion, this  section  underscores  the  critical  role  of  chemical  water quality parameters in shaping fish behavior and their adaptive responses.

## 5   |   Chemical Pollutants

Chemical  pollutants,  such  as  those  from  industrial  waste and oil  spills  resulting  from  human  activities,  have  become increasingly  common  in  aquaculture  and  can  have  direct and indirect effects  on  multiple  tissues,  ultimately  affecting fish  behavior.  However,  unlike  other  water  quality  parameters,  chemical  pollutants  have  the  potential  to  cause  bioenrichment, accumulating within organisms and transferring negative  impacts  to  other  organisms  along  the  food  chain [214-216], thereby drawing increasing attention from relevant researchers in this area.

## 5.1   |   Microplastics

Microplastics  (MPs)  are  insoluble  synthetic  solid  particles  or polymer matrices with a regular or irregular shape that range in size from 1 to 5000 μm [217]. Nowadays, MPs are widely distributed globally and difficult to degrade, and some break down into  smaller,  harder-  to-  detect  particles  known  as  nanoplastics [218, 219]. Owing to their small size, MPs easily attach to parts of fish such as gills, skin, and be taken in through respiration and digestion [214, 220, 221]. As is reported, microplastic particles have been found in the digestive systems of captive and wildcaught fish in the ocean [222], even in the stomachs of polar cods in the Arctic ecosystem [223]. Once inside the fish body, MPs may spread through the bloodstream to various body areas, leading to stress from oxidation, metabolic problems, weakened immune function and hindered growth [219, 224, 225]. More concerning, MPs in fish bodies can be transferred through the food chain from  low  to  high  trophic  level  organisms  [226,  227],  causing negative impacts and posing serious health risks and ecological security issues (Figure 6). The wide range of these impacts has made it a vital topic in the field of aquaculture [228, 229].

## 5.1.1       Feeding and MPs Intake |

The main route for MPs uptake in fish involves inadvertent ingestion, either by mistaking MPs as food or through incidental consumption during feeding or respiration [220, 227]. Studies on  zebrafish  and  common  goby  ( Pomatoschistus  microps ) [230, 231] reveal that the presence of MPs alongside food reduces fish discernment, leading to increased MPs consumption, especially as food abundance rises. Feeding habits also influence MPs intake; fish that swallow whole prey consume more MPs compared with those fed by filter or suction feeders [232],  and  piscivorous fish are more prone to MPs ingestion than those feeding on crustaceans or gelatinous zooplankton [233]. Furthermore, personality of individual fish affects MPs uptake as well, as exemplified by bolder zebrafish consuming more MPs than their shyer counterparts [234]. However, some fish possess mechanisms to minimize the ingestion of microplastics. Species relying on chemosensory cues for feeding can better discriminate against nonedible particles [220] and some fish, like hybrid groupers, utilize both visual and taste senses to  distinguish  MPs  from  edible  items  [235],  although  fish that  specialize  in  visually  hunting  small  prey-  like  plankton may confuse MPs for food, especially under starvation conditions [220]. Notably, certain fish exhibit reflexive expulsion

FIGURE 6 |    Interaction between MPs and fish.

<!-- image -->

of  ingested  MPs,  as  seen  in  largemouth  bass,  yellow  catfish ( Pelteobagrus  fulvidraco ),  goldfish  and  zebrafish,  which  can help reduce MPs accumulation within their bodies by spontaneously  coughing  up  MPs  mixed  with  mucus  [232,  234], although  this  rejection  mechanism  may  also  damaging  oral tissue and disrupting normal feeding [236].

The  accumulation  of  MPs  in  fish  digestive  systems  can  obstruct  feeding  and  intestinal  transit,  leading  to  malnutrition and starvation or a state of a false sense of satiety which hinders growth and development [237, 238]. This accumulation impacts appetite, feeding behaviors, and energy allocation across various physiological functions [239]. The severity of these effects correlates with MP size, with smaller MPs having greater impacts. Micron-  sized plastics can be ingested and expelled [227]. However,  smaller  MPs,  or  even  nanoplastics,  can  accumulate in the organs like gills, liver and intestines [214], causing various  damage,  inducing  inhibiting  enzyme  activity,  oxidative stress  metabolic  changes,  and  affecting  energy  distribution [214,  240,  241],  severely  compromising  multiple  physiological functions and leading to alterations in fish behavior to varying degrees as following.

## 5.1.2       MPs Intake-  Induced Behavioral Changes |

MPs  accumulation  in  the  digestive  tract  stimulates  the  gut and  impacts  digestion,  leading  to  reduced  food  intake  and altered feeding behavior [242]. This results in energy deficits that  constrain  swimming  speed,  turning  angle,  and  range of  movement  [243,  244],  notably  diminishing  foraging  efficiency,  as  observed  in  species  like  black  rockfish  ( Sebastes schlegelii )  [242].  Furthermore,  MPs  exposure  impairs  olfactory function in some fish, undermining their ability to detect environmental cues which are vital for prey localization and predator avoidance [245]. In response to MPs contamination, fish like black rockfish aggregate more closely to form compact schools, manifested as decreased IID [243], which may serves as a defensive strategy against predators and to facilitate essential tasks like foraging. These observations collectively  highlight  the  adverse  influence  of  MPs  pollution  on fish  swimming, predator-prey interactions and social structures [246], thereby substantially reducing their adaptability within both natural and aquaculture ecosystems.

The severity of MPs impacts on fish behavior is related to multiple factors: MPs concentration, shape, size, and exposure duration [221, 247, 248]. Higher MPs concentrations provoke greater organ stimulation, such as in the eyes and gills [247], and increase the likelihood of accidental ingestion; irregularly shaped MPs have a more pronounced effect than spherical ones, causing a more significant decline in swimming ability, with shorter total movement and lower  maximum swimming speed observed in sheepshead minnow ( Cyprinodon variegatus ) [247]. Smaller MPs, particularly nanoplastics, pose heightened risks due to their larger specific surface area (the ratio of surface area to volume) and enhanced penetration capabilities, facilitating cellular absorption and interaction with organisms [245], leading to potentially more severe outcomes, as demonstrated in a study, in which goldfish larvae exposed to 1000 μg/L  nanoplastics  for  3 days  exhibited  markedly  reduced swimming speeds, with further decreases noted after 1 week at both 100 and 1000 μg/L exposure levels [214].

In general, MPs are widely distributed and capable of inducing multiple negative impacts on fish. These negative effects mainly stem from the ingestion of MPs by fish, which disrupts physiological activities at the tissue and organ levels, leading to oxidative stress  or  affecting  energy  distribution  and  other  physiological

functions,  thereby  restricting  certain  behavioral  patterns  like swimming. Fish subjected to MPs stress experience decreased adaptability to their environment, highlighting the urgent need to address this issue in aquaculture.

## 5.2   |   Crude Oil

The  development  of  seabed  oil  exploration  and  shipping  has led to the entry of crude oil into marine and freshwater aquaculture environment [249, 250]. After the Deepwater Horizon incident, a large number of studies on the impact of crude oil were conducted [251-253]. They showed that exposure to crude oil  can  have a destructive impact on fish because of impaired organ function, consequently leading to behavioral changes. It is worth noting that crude oil contains complex mixtures of components, and most current researches on the effects of crude oil on fish behavior focuses primarily on the impacts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

## 5.2.1       Swimming |

Impairments in fish swimming ability have been observed due to exposure to environments contaminated with crude oil, mainly as a result of cardiovascular and muscular dysfunctions [254-258]. Red drum and cobia ( Rachycentron canadum )  exposed to PAHs showed reductions in stroke volume and cardiac output, accompanied by increased heart rate [256, 257]. Mahi-  mahi ( Coryphaena hippurus )  embryos  and  juveniles  exposed  to  PAHs  for  24 h  suffered  severe  cardiovascular  dysfunction  [258],  highlighting  the consistent detrimental impact across developmental stages. These findings collectively illustrate the profound disruption of cardiovascular  health  in  fish  exposed  to  crude  oil,  with  implications for  their  overall  swimming  endurance  and  survival  [255,  256]. Specifically, mahi-  mahi exposed to a mix of PAHs at 8.4 μg/L displayed a 14% drop in critical swimming speed, a 10% decrease in optimal swimming speed, a 20% reduction in maximum metabolic rate, and a 29% decline in aerobic scope [251]. Atlantic haddock ( Melanogrammus aeglefinus ) larvae exposed to crude oil at 10 and 80 μg/L for 8 days experienced a 30%-40% decrease in swimming speed [259]. European sea bass larvae exposed to weathered crude oil and dispersant at 80 mg/L for 1 month showed reduced hypoxia tolerance and swimming capacity [260]. Moreover, crude oil exposure also alters calcium cycling in skeletal muscles [261, 262] and decreases muscle mitochondrial function [254, 255], constraining swimming ability and impacting social competition [263].

Noted that, fish exposed to oil pollution often experience a delayed  recovery  of  their  cardiorespiratory  functions,  with  sublethal  effects  potentially  lingering  [264].  This  means  that  if exposed to oil in early life, especially during the embryonic and larval stages, negative effects on cardiac function may persist as fish as they grow. Nearly a year after embryonic oil exposure, adult zebrafish showed abnormal changes in heart shape during growth and significantly reduced swimming capacity [265]. A similar phenomenon was observed in mahi-  mahi [264], as exposure of embryos and larvae to 1.2 ± 0.6 μg/L ΣPAHs for 48 h and then developing them to juveniles or directly exposure juveniles to 30 ± 7 μg/L ΣPAHs for 24 h led to significant 37% and 22% decreases  in  the  critical  swimming  speed,  respectively.  And  the suppression of swimming capacity can impair a wide range of normal critical exercises, such as schooling.

## 5.2.2       Schooling |

It  has  been  documented  that  exposure  to  oil  can  disrupt  the schooling  behavior  of  fish:  the  cohesion  and  performance  of Atlantic  croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus )  schools  were  significantly  impaired  following  acute  oil  exposure  at  a  concentration  of  32.9 ± 5.9 μg/L  ΣPAHs,  as  indicated  by  an  increase in  inter-  individual  distance  and  decrease  in  movement  speed [266]. Similarly, zebrafish schools exposed to 100 μM PAH benzo[a]pyrene  showed  increased  IID  (10.0 ± 0.3 cm)  compared with  control  group  (7.6 ± 0.4 cm),  and  decreased  total  movement  distance  (5204 ± 120 cm)  compared  with  control  group (5898 ± 226 cm)  [267].  Furthermore,  it  was  found  that  even  if only one fish suffers from crude oil exposure, other fish in the school will also be affected, thus compromising the cohesion of the entire school [266].

## 5.2.3       Exploratory and Anxiety-  Like Behavior |

A  syndrome-  like  condition  can  be  resulted  from  exposure  to crude oil  [268],  which  may  lead  to  a  wide  range  of  behavioral changes, such as abnormal exploratory and anxiety-  like behaviors  and  avoidance responses. Active and exploratory behavior represents  boldness,  which  often  emphasizes  rewards  rather than risks; in contrast, spending more time swimming in situ, staying closer to the habitat, and exhibiting low activity represent anxiety-  like behavior, which emphasizes safety rather than potential rewards [269]. In a series of studies, researchers observed that zebrafish exhibited decreased anxiety-  like behavior and engaged in more exploratory behavior after exposure to crude oil or its components, suggesting an increase in boldness. For example, zebrafish preferred to stay in the center of the arena after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene [267]. However, exposure to crude oil does not always promote exploratory behavior and inhibit anxiety-  like behaviors. Some studies have shown that exposure to different components of crude oil mixtures can increase anxiety-  like behavior in fish and decrease exploratory behavior. For example, zebrafish exposed to two PAH mixtures (one from pyrolysis and one  from  light  crude  oil)  [270]  and  the  water-  soluble  fraction (WSF) of crude oil [271] showed increased anxiety-  like behaviors. In  addition,  Trinidadian  guppies  from  crude  oil-  contaminated sites had lower exploratory behavior than those from uncontaminated sites, indicating that exposure to oil suppressed exploratory behavior  [272].  These  experimental  differences  underscore  the complexity and species-  specific nature of crude oil impacts.

## 5.2.4       Avoidance Response |

Similar  to  responses  elicited  by  other  environmental  stressors, fish  may  exhibit  behavioral  changes,  such  as  an  avoidance  response,  to  escape  from  crude-  oil-  polluted  environments  [273]. Avoidance responses help reduce the time fish come into contact with oil-  polluted  water [274], thus alleviating stress. Avoidance responses  are  dependent  on  the  species,  oil  composition,  and oil  concentration.  Some fish initiate avoidance responses when

encountering even very low concentrations of environmental oil pollutants, such as the European sea bass, which shows significant avoidance responses to 8.54 μg/L ΣPAH [274]. Caspian roach ( Rutilus caspicus ) can also detect and avoid the WSF of crude oil at a concentration of 2 mg/L [275]. However, not all fish can detect or avoid oil at extremely low concentrations. Gulf killifish ( Fundulus grandis ), sailfin molly ( Poecilia latipinna ), and sheepshead minnow,  all  estuarine  fish,  only  showed  significant  avoidance  responses to oil pollution at medium (20 mg/L) to high (40 mg/L) concentrations  [276].  As  crude  oil  exposure  can  impair  vision, olfaction [277, 278], it may be more difficult for fish to avoid oil pollution  following  exposure.  For  instance,  mahi-  mahi,  which can distinguish oil based on their olfactory senses, pre-  exposed to 14.5 μg/L ΣPAH for 24 h were unable to avoid oil-  contaminated areas, while unexposed fish were able to avoid it [252].

## 5.3   |   Summary

The ubiquitous presence of chemical pollutants is indisputable, permeating various systems of aquaculture, with microplastics and crude oil contaminants no longer confined to marine culture alone [219, 238, 279, 280]. Studies and reports have highlighted the presence of microplastics even in intensive RASs, signifying their omnipresence across aquatic environments [280]. The impact of these pollutants on fish is profound, primarily stemming from  ingestion  or  accidental  consumption,  leading  to  physiological disruptions that manifest in abnormal behavior. These include disturbances to energy regulation, feeding, swimming, schooling, and the induction of exploratory and anxiety-  like behaviors in individuals [221, 225, 267, 268]. Against this backdrop of widespread chemical pollution, examining its impact on fish behavior serves as a cautionary note. The concern extends beyond microplastics and crude oil, as numerous other chemical pollutants  similarly  imperil  aquaculture  productivity  and  the welfare of fish populations. Analysis here aims to underscore the urgency for vigilance and mitigation strategies in safeguarding  both  the  sustainability  of  aquaculture  production  and  the welfare of aquatic life.

## 6   |   Conclusions

This  review  summarizes  the  profound  influence  of  water  parameters-temperature,  turbidity,  DO,  salinity,  pH,  inorganic nitrogen, microplastics, and crude oil pollution-on fish behaviors,  encompassing  swimming,  schooling,  feeding,  predation and anti-  predation, avoidance responses, exploratory behavior, aggression,  anxiety-  like  behavior,  and  courtship  (detailed  in Supporting  Information  S1).  While  not  all  behaviors  are  reviewed within each respective water parameter section and not all  the  species  referred  in  this  review  belongs  to  aquaculture species,  the  overarching  intent  is  to  underscore  the  profound and pervasive impact of these water quality parameters on fish behavior, thereby informing future research and facilitating advancements in aquaculture management practices.

Aquaculture  systems  require  tailored  water  quality  management. Outdoor extensive systems, due to their susceptibility to disturbance  and  environmental  complexity,  witness  a  wider array  of  behavior-  modulating  effects,  necessitating  intricate assessments of diverse water quality parameters and behaviors tailored to variable environments. In contrast, intensive indoor systems like RAS, with greater water quality management, the dynamics of these behaviors assume critical importance. Given the link between water quality and fish behavior, understanding these patterns is crucial for sustainable aquaculture management and fish welfare. While fish behavior holds a wealth of  information  regarding  water  quality  and  fish  welfare  in aquaculture systems, the practical implementation of behavior monitoring  for  enhanced  production  and  welfare  assurance currently faces notable challenges and incurs substantial costs. Nonetheless, propelled by technological advancements and the global emphasis on fish welfare and sustainability, the utilization  of  fish  behavior  as  a  tool  for  assessing  water  quality  and estimating  fish  welfare  in  aquaculture  is  emerging  as  an  increasingly prominent trend.

## Foreword

MarinTrust 1 is the leading independent business to business certification programme for the marine ingredients value chain. Responsible sourcing and manufacturing is vital if marine ingredients are to remain a relevant ingredient in feed for land animals and agriculture, pet care and directly in the production of consumer products, including cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Fishmeal and fish oil make up the largest share of marine ingredients today, however all  marine ingredients are included in MarinTrust's sco pe.

To enable stakeholders to credibly demonstrate the commitment to responsible practice in areas of feed safety, raw material procurement, delivery, and throughout the production process, MarinTrust developed a robust Certification Programme, consisting of three main components:

- · The MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients: The verification and certification of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from approved fisheries and by-product species.
- · The MarinTrust Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard: The verification and certification of the chain of custody for marine ingredients (products) that come from MarinTrust certified factories along the value chain to the customer.
- · The Improver Programme: The verification and approval of marine ingredients factories that source their raw material from accepted MarinTrust Improver fisheries.

The initial  MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients (the 'Standard') was finalised and the programme opened for applications in  October 2009,  with the first factory receiving IFFO RS (now known as MarinTrust) certification in February 2010. Version 2.0 was launched in July 2017.

The Standard has since been regularly revised in line with relevant international norms, such as those set by the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO/IEC 17065 ,  ISO/IEC  17067 ) and the 2 3 International Social  and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling  (ISEAL) . This  ongoing process 4 ensures that  the Standard  remains  accessible, credible, and  relevant to  industry  needs, and  in particular that the assessment process continues to be robust.

Revisions  are  undertaken  by  a  series of  expert committees within  the  MarinTrust  governance structure . These committees represent the full  marine ingredient value chain,  including  marine 5 ingredient producers, feed processors, fisheries and aquaculture standard holders and retailers as well as fisheries experts, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Revisions are also subject to public consultation in line with the ISEAL Codes of Good Practice . 6

The process of developing V3.0 started in 2021,  with the revised version finalised in October 2023. The next review of the Standard will begin no later than October 2028.

## Introduction

## Governance

The MarinTrust programme is overseen by the MarinTrust Governing Body Committee (GBC), which is responsible for the continued advancement of the MarinTrust standards to ensure they remain both credible and relevant with respect to the stated objectives.

The  MarinTrust Governing Body Committee has  endorsed Version 3.0  of the  MarinTrust  Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients. Throughout the development of Version 3.0, the needs of the marine ingredients value chain and interested parties have been at the centre to ensure effective representation throughout.

## Principles  and  objectives  of  the  Standard  for  Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients

MarinTrust subscribes to and promotes the principles of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries through the development and adoption of this programme.

Through  its  voluntary  adoption,  MarinTrust  certificate  holders  will  further  demonstrate  their commitment to supporting the principles of sustainable fisheries development.

The key objectives of this version of the Standard are:

- · to continue to meet the objectives set in the development of Version 2.0 of this Standard
- · to enhance and strengthen the MarinTrust fisheries approval criteria for raw materials (whole fish and by-products) used for the production of compliant marine ingredients to promote more robust responsible fishery management
- · to enhance the traceability criteria to provide assurance to the traceability and integrity of the compliant marine ingredient
- · to enhance the MarinTrust Good Manufacturing Practices criteria by taking into consideration good manufacturing practices for products intended for human consumption to ensure that marine ingredients are produced in compliance with relevant and robust practices for food safety
- · to promote  more  efficient  marine ingredients  production practices to reduce  the environmental impact of the marine ingredients manufacturing process
- · to promote and create improved social and welfare benefits for all workers employed within the marine ingredients manufacturing sector
- · to evaluate the extension of the Standard's scope to include human rights criteria for vessels supplying whole fish to the marine ingredients manufacturing sector
- · to ensure that Version 3.0 of the Standard remains relevant, robust, and fit for purpose.

## The scope of this Standard

<!-- image -->

This document defines what shall be achieved for certification to the 'MarinTrust Global Standard for Responsible Supply of Marine Ingredients Version 3.0' and sets out the requirements that shall be achieved by facilities for certification.

The Standard covers the sourcing and production of marine ingredients.

The Standard ensures that:

- · marine ingredients are produced to high standards of safety and quality, with sufficient care for the environment, workforce, and local community
- · the raw  materials used to produce marine ingredients are not  sourced from IUU fishing activity,  do  not  stem from an  endangered  species, for whole fish, are  from  responsibly managed fisheries aligned to the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries 7

This Standard focuses on 3 key pillars:

## Responsible sourcing

## Responsible traceability

Raw materials:

- - are not sourced from IUU fishing activity,
- - do not stem from an endangered species
- - for whole fish, are from responsibly managed fisheries aligned to the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries

## Responsible production

- - Safe marine ingredients are produced in a safe workplace
- - Worker welfare and employment conditions are in place.
- - Consideration of  the local community
- - Environmental accountability is in place

## Unit of certification

The unit of certification for this Standard is the facility i.e.  the marine ingredient (fishmeal or fish oil) production factory.

Certification is only valid provided the production facility sources from at least one raw material source that is approved and/or accepted and/or recognised according to MarinTrust requirements.

## Recognition of other standards

To  promote  the  co-existence of  independent certification  programmes  and  avoid  unnecessary duplication of effort, MarinTrust has a 'Recognition Procedure' to formally recognise standards and benchmark tools which may be fully or partially equivalent to the raw material or facility requirements of MarinTrust.

Marine ingredients can be traced back to raw materials that conform to the requirements of this Standard

For more information, refer to the MarinTrust website, which includes a list of recognised standards and benchmark tools.

## Logo use and claims

Certified facilities who wish to use the MarinTrust logo and/or Improver Programme claim must do so in line with the MarinTrust Brand Guidelines.

All  certified and accepted sites under the MarinTrust  programme must sign  the relevant  licence agreement and claims policy and seek approval from MarinTrust before use.

Misuse of the logo and/or any claims will be investigated.

For more information, refer to the MarinTrust brand guidelines on the MarinTrust website.

## Section 1: Responsible sourcing prerequisites

This section includes the requirements for sourcing raw materials (whole fish and by-products) from wild capture fisheries.

Only raw materials that are approved/accepted/recognised according to MarinTrust requirements are permitted to be included within the scope of certification to this Standard.

These raw  materials  must  have  approval/acceptance/recognition in  place  as  a  pre-requisite to application and certification.

## 1.1 Responsible sourcing

In this Standard to comply with the definition of responsible sourcing, the facility shall be able to demonstrate:

1.1.1

The responsible sourcing of legal, regulated and reported fishery material and the avoidance of material sourced from illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing activity.

1.1.2

Sourcing whole fish raw material from fisheries that comply with the key requirements of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.

1.1.3

Raw materials are not from species that:

- · are a marine mammal, reptile, amphibian or bird
- · stem from fisheries that use dynamiting, poisoning and other comparable destructive fishing practices
- · appear in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix 1 or 2
- · are categorised as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List

The facility shall source whole fish raw material from a MarinTrust approved fishery, and/or MarinTrust recognised equivalent fishery and/or an accepted MarinTrust Fishery Improvement Project (FIP).

The facility shall source wild-capture by-product raw material from a MarinTrust approved by-product species, and/or MarinTrust recognised equivalent by-product species.

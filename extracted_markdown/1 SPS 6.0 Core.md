## Introduction

Founded in 1997, the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA) is an international non-governmental organization dedicated to advocacy, education, and leadership in responsible aquaculture. GSA engages stakeholders worldwide who are dedicated to advancing environmentally and socially responsible aquaculture practices.

Through the development of the Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) certification standards, GSA has become the leading standards-setting organization for seafood (www.globalseafood.org and www.bapcertification.org.)

## Background to the Standard and Standard Scope

This document is the Seafood Processing Standard (SPS) Core - Issue 6.0 and is to be audited jointly with various SPS Modules based on the scope of processing facilities applying for certification. The Standard and its modules replace the Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) Seafood Processing Standard - Issue 5.1. The full content of the Seafood Processing Standard 6.0 includes:

- · Food Safety Management and Related Requirements (Core C1-C4)
- · Effluent Management Requirements (Core C1)
- · Water Quality Testing Requirements (Core C3)
- · Environmental Management Requirements (Core C5)
- · Traceability Requirements (Core C6)
- · Glossary
- · Animal Welfare Module
- · Effluent Discharge Module
- · Finished Product Testing Module
- · Outsourcing Module
- · Product Identity Preservation Module
- · Environmental Module for Remote Isolated Wild-Capture Processors
- · Social Responsibility Module (mandatory unless Enhanced Social Module is selected)
- · Enhanced Social Module (voluntary add-on)

Facilities shall be assessed to all SPS Core requirements, plus all SPS modules that fall within the scope of the seafood processing that is undertaken at that facility. Compliance with all requirements (full scope) is required for certification , unless preauthorized by GSA. Facilities may also elect to be assessed and certified to the Enhanced Social Responsibility Module when, or after, applying for SPS Issue 6.0 Certification.  Please see the Enhanced Social Responsibility Module for additional information.

The  objective  of  the  Food  Safety  Management  and  Related  Requirements  of  the  Seafood  Processing Standard  is  to  specify  the  food  safety  and  quality  criteria  required  to  be  in  place  within  a  seafood manufacturing or processing organization to achieve certification to the SPS. The format and content of the Standard is designed to allow an assessment of a facility's premises and operational systems and procedures by a competent GSA-approved third-party Certification Body.

The Seafood Processing Standard covers nearly all aquaculture and wild-caught species as follows:

- · Finfish
- · Crustaceans
- · Mollusks
- · Echinoderms
- · Medusozoans
- · Frogs

## Assessments

New applicants are advised to carry out a self-assessment against the standard to ascertain their readiness for a thirdparty Certification Body (CB) audit. Applicants are to rectify any deficiencies identified as part of their self-assessment prior to the third-party CB audit.

Once an applicant's selfassessment has been carried out and is satisfied that all deficiencies identified have been corrected the facility can proceed to Certification.

To become certified Applicants must be able to demonstrate compliance with this Standard, through an independent third-party on-site assessment by a GSA Approved CB.

The CB must be approved by GSA and be accredited to ISO/IEC 17065:2012 (Conformity assessment Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes, and services) by an Accreditation Body who is a Member  of  the  International  Accreditation  Forum  and  a  signatory  to  the  Multilateral  Recognition Agreement.

The chosen Certification Body will formulate an agreement between the Applicant and the Certification Body detailing the requirements and commitments needed from the Applicant.

The GSA will maintain a list of approved Certification Bodies.

Facilities that are newly built or pre-existing facilities that an entity is moving the production operation into must ensure that the requirements of the Standard are well implemented before they proceed to an initial assessment by the thirdparty Certification Body. Such facilities must be in operation for at least 3 months from commencing production to ensure that they can provide documentation and records to include all annual and semi-annual requirements to demonstrate full compliance to the Core Standard and applicable modules during the assessment. Examples of annual and semiannual records and documentation that shall be available for the initial audit include:

- · Water testing results
- · Ice testing results
- · Effluent testing (if applicable)
- · Environmental testing
- · Mock recall
- · Finished product testing (if applicable)

## Assessment Frequency

Audits to the Seafood Processing Standard are conducted at a frequency of once per annum. However, reaudits,  short  notice,  or  unannounced  audits  shall  also  be  conducted  at  GSA  and  Certification  Body discretion where facility compliance concerns arise.

## Scope of Audit

Duration of Assessments, and Non-Conformities

The duration of an assessment is dependent on several factors such as the size of the operation, number of workers, process lines, HACCP plans, and/or number of species processed. In most cases the duration would be a minimum of two days (all days on site, or combined desktop review in advance before time on site). In all cases it shall be sufficient to ensure that a full assessment against the full requirements of the SPS is achieved.

The GSA will insist upon accurate assessments by the Certification Body with a duration sufficient to ensure integrity of the audit and achieve the audit objectives.

The Certification Body shall be mindful that the assessment format is one of systems review and physical inspection of the site and manufacturing process. Time allocation during the assessment shall be such to

provide sufficient and proportionate time for each activity to be carried out in full and where appropriate, additional time given when the Auditor is required to carry out further investigation.

All requirements in the Standard shall be addressed. As with other GSA-BAP standards, the audit against the SPS will consist of the elements cited in accordance with ISO19011.

- · Opening meeting
- · Site assessment (including dormitory and canteen, if applicable)
- · C ollection of any necessary samples (product and effluent)
- · Worker interviews
- · Review of management systems / records and procedures

At the closing meeting, the Auditor shall present his/her findings and discuss all non -conformities that have been  identified  during  the  assessment  but  shall  not  make  any  comment  on  the  likely  outcome  of  the Assessment. A written summary of the non-conformities discussed at the closing meeting shall be agreed upon and signatures from the facility representative obtained. A copy of the non-conformity report must be left with the facility prior to the auditor departing the facility.

The facility shall provide the CB, in accordance with GSABAP certification management rules, suitable and adequate objective evidence that corrective action has been implemented to rectify the non-conformity. This evidence shall also address root cause and future prevention. The evidence will be reviewed, and the CB will respond either confirming closure of the non -conformity or requesting further evidence.

The facility  must  submit evidence to the CB to close out all non-conformities within 35 calendar days. Failure to close out nonconformities in the given timeframe will result in certification not being granted or continued, and facilities will be required to reapply for a full assessment for certifi cation (refer current issue of GSA Policy on Supplementary Audits of Facilities).

## Audit Reporting and the Certification Decision

The  Auditor  will  provide  a  full  report  of  the  assessment,  including  the  details  of  any  non-conformities issued. The Auditor will submit the report to the Certification Body. The report shall include brief statements of objective evidence of both conformity, and non-conformity.

The report shall follow the format specified by the GSA. The report shall be issued in accordance with the GSA  Report  Guidelines.  Within  the  Assessment  Report  there  shall  be  a  record  of  the  duration  of  the assessment (expressed as hours) and any reason for the lengthening or shortening of the duration from that which is typical.

The  audit  report  along  with  the  corrective  actions  submitted  by  the  facility  will  be  evaluated  by  a Certification Committee of the CB, who will make the final certification decision post closure of all non -conformities.  The  timelines  for  audit,  closure  of  nonconformities,  technical  review  and  certification decision are as specified in the Requirements for Certification Bodies Offering Certification Against the Criteria of the Global Seafood Alliance Best Aquaculture Practices Standards. To achieve certific ation to the Seafood Processing Standard, the applicant facility must meet all of the requirements of the Standard.

The  Applicant  who  commissioned  the  Assessment  owns  the  Assessment  Report.  However,  a  written agreement  shall  be  in  place  between  the  GSAapproved  Certification  Body  and  the  auditee  for  the authorization of the provision of a Report to the GSA.

When audit reports are sent to the Applicant, they shall be in a secure (PDF) format to prevent modification.

The Assessment report will be considered by a Certification Committee of the Certification Body, who will make the final certification decision.

## Appeals

The Applicant has the right to appeal assigned non-conformity and/or the severity of the non-conformity as well as the certification decision of the Certification Body. Appeals should be made in writing within seven days of the Certification decision.

A full response will be given by a Certification Body Manager independent of the auditor and Certification Committee.

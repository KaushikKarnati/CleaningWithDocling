It occurs in gene transfer when the microinjected DNA fragment integrates after the one-cell embryonic stage, resulting in some cells containing the transgene and others not. Similarly, in genome editing techniques like CRISPR/Cas9, mosaicism can occur if the editing machinery induces genetic modifications in only a portion of the targeted cells, leading to the coexistence of edited and unedited cells within the organism."}]}
